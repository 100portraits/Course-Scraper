Dynamics of Majorana Fermions on Cosmological Spaces and Leptogenesis,"['Unnithan, Vishnu Hari']","['Prokopec, T.']",2021-10-29T23:00:13Z,EN,['Majorana Fermions; De Sitter space; Majorana propagator'],Theoretical Physics,"The thesis presented here is motivated by Leptogenesis where the study of dynamics of Majorana fermions become
crucial. Majorana fermion dynamics are discussed contrasting them with the dynamics of Dirac fermions. Equations
of motion for Majorana fermions are studied in spatially homogeneous conformal spaces. The said equations reveal
a certain topological structure and this is realized by solving them on de Sitter space. We then use them to
construct the Feynman propagator for Majorana fermions."
Repatriation Beyond Property,"['Bernet Kempers, Felix']","['Verdonschot, Clint']",2021-11-01T00:00:23Z,EN,"['Repatriation, reparation, cultural heritage, cultural internationalism, cultural nationalism']",Applied Ethics,"With more and more pressure mounting on museums to repatriate stolen and looted artefacts to source communities, a clear ethical framework is still missing. In a world where existing legal frameworks seem able to provide little guidance when it comes to ethical dilemmas surrounding restitution issues, the need for alternative frameworks becomes all the more pressing. Furthermore, the repatriation debate within philosophy is held hostage by a stalemate between two opposite positions concerning cultural property, cultural internationalism and cultural nationalism. In this thesis I will explore when the repatriation of stolen and looted art and artefacts is morally justified. First, the practice of repatriation is illuminated and I reveal the universal museum as an institution in line with cultural internationalism. Both cultural internationalism and cultural nationalism will be applied to a cases involving ancient looted art, Nazi looted art and the litmus test of repatriation claims: colonial looted art. In the last chapter I propose an alternative framework that deploys arguments from the cultural internationalist framework in favour of repatriation and combine them with Bernard Boxill’s harm argument from the debate about reparations for slavery."
Sustainable binders for the creation of a dredge-based tile,"['Spinnewijn, Otger']","['Wolthers, Mariëtte']",2021-11-05T00:00:14Z,EN,['geopolymer; dredged sediment; flexural strength analysis; compression; pouring'],Biofabrication,"This paper focuses on the search for sustainable alternative binders to cement. These binders will be
used in a dredge-based tile created by the start-up Waterweg. After a literature review, a ground
granulated blast furnace slag binder named Eco2cem, a metakaolin-based binder named Topcrete, a
sludge from wastewater treatment named Kaumera and lignosulfonate were selected and tested in
the experimental phase. In this phase, samples containing these binders are created through either
compression or pouring. These samples are analysed based on their flexural strength. The poured
samples are generally stronger than the compressed ones. Lignosulfonate and Kaumera cannot fully
replace cement, whereas Topcrete showed to be able to fully replace in compressed samples. Poured
samples containing Eco2cem as a sole binder showed great results that are similar to the flexural
strength values of the control group that still contained OPC. Efforts should now go into the
optimization of Eco2cem- and Topcrete-based samples"
Geolocational Soundwalk as Ecological Choreography: Walking and Listening Towards Ecological Awareness,"['Radi Buh, Maša']","['Karreman, L.L.']",2021-11-01T00:00:22Z,EN,"['ecology, interconnectedness, ecological choreography, choreography, soundwalk']","Contemporary Theatre, Dance and Dramaturgy","This thesis considers the ecological potential of performing arts with reference to a stimulation of ecological experience of interconnectedness. I then offer a brief overview of two main academic outlooks on performance and ecology. On the one hand, there is a premise of informational models of theatre where ecological contribution is represented by facing the audience with factual information on ecological crisis. On the other, the ecocritical potential lies in producing ecological experiences of ecological awareness. Performances such as these offer the audience ways of attending and perceiving which produce ecological awareness, a term coined by Timothy Morton. Delving into various interpretations of ecology, I sketch out some of its key characteristics, with an awareness of the human's position within the interconnected nature of ecosystems of environments being the main one. Choreography as a definition of things in space and time means refers to performance’s way of producing such ecological experiences. The case study Sandbox and the form of geolocational soundwalks are an example of ecological choreography because of their use of listening and the mechanics of the medium to produce an experience of ecological awareness. Interconnected characteristics of geolocational soundwalks where its realisation is dependent on geographical location in combination with sound make it an example of ecological choreography."
Wannier exciton states in a 1D topological chain,"['Wang, Zhiwei']","['Stoof, H.T.C.']",2021-11-01T00:00:21Z,EN,['Topological excitons; winding number; 1D chain; Topological insulators'],Theoretical Physics,"This thesis investigates the properties of 1D Wannier excitons in a 1D s-p wave hybrid chain. Based on the tight-binding model, we first calculate the winding number of the single-electron band structure. Then, we introduce the particle-hole basis with the interband Coulomb interaction in 1D to determine the bound-state spectrum and the dispersion relation of excitons. Finally, we calculate the winding number for the exciton states themselves and show that it is exactly twice as large as the single-electron winding number in the same 1D chain."
An exploration of machine learning to predict medication waste amongst rheumatoid arthritis patients.,"['Go, Katrina']","['Egberts, A.C.G.']",2021-10-29T11:01:32Z,EN,['rheumatoid arthritis; medication waste; machine learning; pharmacy'],Science and Business Management,"Background: In case of treatment failure, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients switch their relatively expensive biological disease- modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) therapy, which could lead to waste. Machine learning has potential to be used in pharmacy to predict medication waste.

Aim: To explore the application of machine learning to identify patterns in patient, clinical and medication factors that lead to medication waste. 

Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, patient, clinical and medication data was collected from a Dutch outpatient pharmacy and hospital information system of patients (≥ 18 years) who received at least one bDMARD prescription, dispensed between January 2015 and December 2020. Medicine waste was defined as a treatment switch before its expected end date. A random forest model was used to identify predictors. 

Results: The database included 1996 patients, of which 285 wasted at least 1 syringe of bDMARD. During the five-year study period, a total of 719 units were unused, with an economic value of €237,692. Out of 32,484 prescriptions, 324 lead to waste. The random forest model had a positive prediction value of 0.21, with total cost of a prescription, age, disease duration, as the highest predictors for medication waste. 

Conclusion: bDMARD waste occurs when rheumatoid arthritis patients switch therapies. Machine learning has the potential to be used in waste preventing activities. With improvements to the model, such as down sampling, reducing features and correcting for correlations, it can be used to identify patterns which lead to medication waste."
Der Stellenwert der Graphic Novel im Schulfach Deutsch als Fremdsprache,"['Zwart, Iris']","['Knaap, Ewout van der']",2021-11-05T00:00:21Z,DU,['Duits; Deutsch; DaF; Deutsch als Fremdsprache; Graphic Novels; Graphic Novel; Literaturunterricht; literatuuronderwijs; Duits als vreemde taal; vreemdetalenonderwijs; Fremdsprachenunterricht; Thinking Aloud; Think Aloud; Lautes Denken; Lesefertigkeit; Theo Witte; leescompetenties; Lesekompetenzen; Lesekompetenz; Literaturdidaktik; leesvaardigheid; comics; HAVO; 4 HAVO'],Duitse taal en cultuur: educatie en communicatie,"In der vorliegenden Masterarbeit wurde untersucht, welchen Stellenwert Graphic Novels im DaF-Unterricht haben. Die Literaturstudie zu diesem Thema hat ergeben, dass der Einsatz von Graphic Novels als literarisches Mittel im DaF-Unterricht zahlreiche Potenziale bietet, wodurch nicht nur sprachliche Kompetenzen gefördert werden, sondern auch literarische Kompetenzen. Um den Stellenwert der Graphic Novels im DaF-Unterricht nicht nur aus theoretischer Perspektive zu erforschen, wurde in dieser empirischen Studie die Methode des lauten Denkens angewandt. Anhand dieser Methode wurde zuerst untersucht, wie das Lesen von Graphic Novels mit den literarischen Kompetenzen von Theo Witte zusammenhängt. Zu diesem Ziel haben sechs teilnehmende SchülerInnen aus einer 10. Klasse einer niederländischen Realschule zuvor eine Checkliste zu den literarischen Kompetenzen und eine verkürzte Version des Literary Response Questionnaire ausgefüllt. Daraus ergaben sich die Selbsteinschätzungen der Kompetenzniveaus der SchülerInnen und das Leseverhalten und die Lesegewohnheiten. Es wurde festgestellt, dass die SchülerInnen unterschiedliche Kompetenzniveaus, Leseverhalten und Lesegewohnheiten haben. Der zweite Teil der empirischen Studie widmete sich dem lauten Denken, wobei die Gedanken der SchülerInnen, anhand fünf verschiedener Graphic Novels und dazugehörenden Aufgaben, laut ausgesprochen wurden. Diese wurden letztendlich mit den literarischen Kompetenzen, den Selbsteinschätzungen und der LRQ verglichen. Hieraus ergab sich, dass die Selbsteinschätzung des Kompetenzniveaus der SchülerInnen, das Leseverhalten und die Lesegewohnheiten mit den literarischen Kompetenzen von Theo Witte übereinstimmten. Zusätzlich wurde untersucht, wie die teilnehmenden SchülerInnen die gelesenen Graphic Novels und die Aufgaben bewerteten. Anhand von Protokollkategorien wurde analysiert, worauf die Teilnehmenden geachtet haben und welche Aspekte bei der Bewertung der Graphic Novels aus der Perspektive der SchülerInnen wichtig sind. Die erworbenen Resultate haben sowohl die Teilfragen als auch die Hauptfrage beantworten können. Die Resultate haben gezeigt, dass Graphic Novels je nach Kompetenzniveau anders bewertet werden. Diese Ergebnisse zeigen den Bedarf der Differenzierung im (literarischen) DaF-Unterricht. Erst dann können Lernende im DaF-Unterricht nämlich ihre Potenziale beim Lesen (von Graphic Novels) benutzen. Indem Graphic Novels an den individuellen Interessen und literarischen Kompetenzen der SchülerInnen anschließen, werden sie sich weiterentwickeln können. Auf Grund dieser Untersuchung ist es möglich zu sehen, wie Graphic Novels im literarischen DaF-Unterricht eingesetzt werden können."
De turboliquidatie van de BV. Een onderzoek naar de wettelijke regeling omtrent de turboliquidatie.,"['Zantinge, Jephta']","['Rensen, G.J.C.']",2021-12-10T00:00:16Z,NL,['Turboliquidatie; artikel 2:19 lid 4 BW; benadeling van schuldeisers; Jephta Zantinge.'],Company and Law,"In deze scriptie is onderzoek verricht naar de wettelijke regeling omtrent de turboliquidatie van de BV. De turboliquidatie is in de juridische literatuur een veelbesproken onderwerp. Dat is niet zonder reden. In deze scriptie breng ik naar voren dat de wettelijke regeling omtrent de turboliquidatie van de BV op verschillende punten onvolkomenheden kent. Schuldeisers die achterblijven na een toegepaste turboliquidatie vissen veelal achter het net vanwege een gebrek aan transparantie. Hoewel achtergebleven schuldeisers de mogelijkheid hebben om enkele rechtsmiddelen in te stellen – welke achtereenvolgens aan bod komen in hoofdstuk 4 -, kleven aan ieder van deze middelen bezwaren die veelal zijn te herleiden tot het gebrek aan transparantie. De kans voor een onbetaald gebleven schuldeisers om succesvol op te komen tegen een onterecht toegepaste turboliquidatie is daarom klein. Gesteld kan worden dat schuldeisers benadeeld kunnen worden door de toepassing van de turboliquidatie en dat zij onder de huidige wettelijke regeling onvoldoende bescherming genieten om op te komen tegen deze benadeling. Om de proceskansen van schuldeisers te vergroten en daarmee hun belangen beter te waarborgen, zijn enkele wettelijke aanpassingen naar mijn idee wenselijk. Op basis van het door mij verrichtte onderzoek kom ik tot de verschillende aanbevelingen aan de wetgever. Zo zou bijvoorbeeld het begrip ‘baten’ uit artikel 2:19 lid 4 BW een nadere concretisering verdienen. Daarnaast zouden schuldeisers de mogelijkheid moeten krijgen om een onderzoek in te stellen, uitgevoerd door een onafhankelijke derde, naar de gang van zaken rondom de turboliquidatie. In de scriptie komen ook andere wettelijke aanpassingen aan bod."

SonarQube rule violations that actually lead to bugs,"['Pol, Tijmen van den']","['Ommen, Thijs van']",2021-12-10T00:00:16Z,EN,['SonarQube; Software Quality; Machine Learning; imbalanced dataset; Technical Debt Dataset'],Computing Science,"SonarQube is a popular free tool for automatically determining bugs and code smells
in code. It is for developers interesting to know which rules that SonarQube uses are
important to solve and which are less important.
We conduct a research with a dataset that connects SonarQube rule violations to
faults. This dataset is made by using a more recent version of SonarQube than was done
before. Machine Learning (ML) is used to obtain feature importance that shows which
rules are really important. We take a look at these importances by taking into account
that the dataset is imbalanced. We use oversampling and ML methods that are good in
dealing with imbalanced data.
For determining the best rules by importances, we focus on rules that can predict
faults well and we focus less on classifying the most entries in the dataset correctly, since
the dataset is imbalanced. We do so by looking at G-mean and F-Beta importances.
Furthermore, we look into the difference between permutation and drop-column
importance, since the paper that this work is inspired on (Lenarduzzi, Lomio, Huttunen,
et al., 2020) used drop-column and we will use permutation importance.
We find that GradientBoost scores best at AUC, G-mean and F1-score. RandomForest
scores best at F5-score. We observe that SonarQube 7 rules do a good job at predicting
faults. However, we also find that a ML method variable importance is different from
what we might find important for a SonarQube rule. When we look at the importance of
types, we find that bugs are relevant for predicting faults, which is different from the
paper that this research was base on Lenarduzzi, Lomio, Huttunen, et al., 2020."
"An investigation into the relationship between humor styles, gratitude, age, and well-being","['Murphy, Katie']","['Doosje, Sibe']",2021-12-09T00:00:17Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"This current study set out to investigate the relationship between humor styles, 
gratitude and age on well-being. This study involved N=114 international participants who 
completed an online questionnaire consisting of the Humor Styles Questionnaire (HSQ) 
developed by Rod Martin, the Gratitude Resentment and Appreciation Test (GRAT) followed 
by the Flourishing Scale for well-being created by (Diener, 2009). Correlational and multiple 
regression analyses including mediation and moderation were run to test the hypotheses. The 
key findings that emerged from the study were that self – enhancing and affiliative humor have 
a strong and significant relationship with well-being, and that self - enhancing humor may be 
the greatest predictor of well-being. Gratitude also displayed a strong relationship with wellbeing, self-enhancing and affiliative humor. Age did not have a significant link to any of the 
humor styles or gratitude, but it did have a significant relationship with well-being. Finally, 
self – defeating and aggressive humor had a weak and negligible relationship with well-being. 
It was suggested from these findings that future research would greatly benefit from 
investigating more exclusively the role of self-enhancing humor and it’s effect on well-being, 
and the incorporation of a self-enhancing humor style and gratitude exercise to cultivate these 
traits. The implications of this research project suggest there is warranty for researchers, mental 
health practitioners and educators to further research approaches in order to cultivate positive 
humor styles and a grateful outlook among the population"
"Equal homes, unequal perceptions?
A study examining the influence of status conditions and group membership characterized by names on perceived status, competence and warmth","['Klaasen, Eva']","['Nunspeet, F. van']",2021-12-09T00:00:17Z,EN,['Stereotype Content Model; warmth; competence; status; group membership; ingroup; outgroup'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","The Stereotype Content Model proposes that perceived social structure, such as competition and status, predicts stereotypes on the dimensions of warmth and competence. The dimension of warmth includes elements of sociability and morality. Competence includes agency and status. In general, high-status individuals are evaluated as being more competent and warm than their low-status counterparts. Group membership might have an effect on this too since ingroup members are perceived as being more competent and warm than outgroup members. It is hypothesized that status, characterized by house type, and group membership, characterized by names, interact with each other and influence homeowner’s competence and warmth evaluations. It is expected that low-status homeowners are evaluated lower in their competence and warmth than high-status homeowners and an outgroup homeowner is evaluated lower in their competence and warmth than the ingroup homeowner, with the interaction between the two variables enhancing this effect. Results show a main effect of status but not of group membership. No interaction between status and group membership is present. Interestingly, it was found that the outgroup homeowner was consistently evaluated lower in warmth, regardless of their status. Possible real world implications for this result might be increased inequality and decreased standard of life for the outgroup. The results provide future research directions regarding the influence of different competition contexts and different types of outgroups which are briefly touched upon in the discussion."
"Humor styles, self-esteem, age and subjective well-being.","['Cheliuskina, Kseniia']","['Doosje, Sibe']",2021-12-09T00:00:17Z,EN,"['Self-esteem, well-being, humor styles.']",Clinical Psychology,"Since previous research showed different associations between humor styles, well-being and self-esteem, this study aims at providing insight into how these positive psychological traits relate to each other in one combined model while also examining the contribution of age. Based on the broaden-and-build theoretical framework, which underline the role of positive emotions in building personal resources and other related empirical findings in regard to positive personality characteristics, it has been hypothesized that adaptive humor styles would be positively associated with self-esteem and well-being, whereas maladaptive humor styles would be negatively associated with self-esteem and well-being. Age would not relate to well-being. The mediator/moderator role of self-enhancing humor style between self-esteem and psychological well-being has been investigated. 
International participants (n= 114, 85 females and 29 males) aged 18-74 years, vast majority of them was highly educated (university level or higher - 93, high school - 20, primary education - 1) completed an online survey including The Humor Styles Questionnaire, The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, The Flourishing Scale, and provided demographic information. Results revealed that well-being was positively associated with self-esteem, age and adaptive humor styles. Maladaptive humor styles had no association with well-being. High self-esteem was related to higher usage of adaptive humor styles as well, but lower usage of self-defeating humor style. Age was positively associated with well-being, and not related to self-esteem or any of the humor styles. Further analyses showed that the most valuable predictors of well-being were self-esteem and self-enhancing humor styles. No moderation effect of self-enhancing humor style on self-esteem and well-being was found. Besides that, well-being was significantly predicted by the combined mediation effect of self-esteem and self-enhancing humor style. Several limitations of the current study and recommendations for future research are discussed. For further research, it might be interesting to examine the role of maladaptive humor styles on self-esteem and well-being. A greater focus on them could produce interesting findings and add new insights on the inconsistent link between them, well-being, and self-esteem."
Understanding neuromodulation of the Stroke Brain using tCMS - A pilot study,"['Sauca, Marius']","['Dijkhuizen, Rick']",2021-12-10T00:00:16Z,EN,['cTBS; TMS; stroke; revalidation; interhemispheric inhibition; recovery'],Science and Business Management,"Even though the mortality rate of strokes has decreased in the past few decades, the number of disability adjusted life year shas increased due to the permanent motor damage left in stroke survivors even after extensive physical therapy. rTMS treatments such as cTBS have had a rise in popularity in recent years and show much promise in the treatment of stroke patients. There are still many unknowns, however, about the effects of rTMS on interhemispheric inhibition and its underlying mechanisms. Therefore our UNOS pilot study was aimed at elucidating these unknowns by testing the effect of cTBS treatment on 10 healthy volunteers and assessing its effect on interhemispheric inhibition and how it relates to handedness. We used two figure-of-eight in a double pulse paradigm in order to stimulate the motor cortex of 10 healthy participants and to assess IHI values at two timepoints. Before and after cTBS treatment. Our results seem to suggest an association between motor control and the transition from interhemispheric inhibiton to facilitation at movement onset, the mean IHI values for the left-right and right-left CS-TS directions were 1.63 and 2.95 respectively. However, this difference is not significant with a P value of 0.058. Our results have also shown that there is a very high interpersonal variability  between participants in the effect elicited by cTBS, therefore limiting generalisation of cTBS treatment. This underlines the need for more personalised treatments and the need for more diagnostics before treamtents."

Assessing the application and quality of competency-based education in training programmes of veterinary specialists in Europe,"['Binnerts, Sophie']","['Theelen, Mathijs']",2021-12-24T00:00:17Z,EN,"['Assessment, Veterinary Education, Veterinary specalisation, specialisation programmes, residents, diplomats, veterinary, cbve, cbme, Competency-based medical education']",Equine Health Care,"Background: Due to developments and modernisation in the medical field, the need for modernisation in medical education is needed as well. This has been the reason for the development of evidence- based medical education (CBME) and its corresponding competency frameworks. As of now, CBME is accepted and applied in many medical institutions across the globe. The Competency-Based Veterinary Education (CBVE) is one of those frameworks and was specifically developed for veterinary curricula. This framework consists of nine essential competency domains for the veterinary professional. The current study uses the CBVE framework to assess the current training programmes of veterinary specialists in Europe. To become a veterinary specialist in Europe, one must follow a training programme at one of the 27 colleges of the European board of specialisation (EBVS). The description of these training programmes can be found in the training programme descriptions or “training brochures” of each of these colleges. The way in which CBVE is applied in these specialist training programmes has not been studied until now. In this study, the current situation regarding competency training in veterinary specialist programmes will be analysed and we will evaluate how the competency domains are represented in these programmes.
Goals of the study: In the current study, a document analysis and a pilot-study are performed. The goal of the document analysis was to evaluate which training tools were used within the different training programmes of EBVS colleges. The goals of the pilot-study were 1) To find out if and how the training tools, as mentioned in the training brochure, were applied within the actual programme of one of the colleges (ECEIM). 2) To find out to what extent these training tools contributed to the personal development of competencies of residents. 3) To find out if there was a difference in perception between diplomats and residents on how the competency-based education was represented in the programme.
Methods: A mixed-method approach was utilised through a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. First, a document analysis was carried out on the different training brochures of the different EBVS colleges to find out which training tools were used in the various residency programmes. Based on the results of this document analysis, a questionnaire was developed. This questionnaire functioned as a pilot-study and was only distributed among members of one of the 27 EBVS colleges: the European College of Equine Internal Medicine (ECEIM).
Results: The results of the document analysis showed that diplomate supervision and hands-on clinical training were described in all programmes, and that workplace-based assessments were rarely used. The results of the pilot-study showed that the training brochure of the ECEIM was often in line with the actual programme in its practical setting. Some mandatory tools such as the review of the resident’ s performance, workshops and seminars, clinical teaching, and self-study, however, were not applied as frequent as described.
Limitations: The document analysis was incomplete due to the fact that some colleges had no (suitable) documents available. Comparing the documents that were available was a challenge as they differed in the level of detail provided. For the pilot-study, no random sample was taken.
Conclusions: Overall, we found that all competency domains, as described by the CBVE, were represented in the ECEIM residency programme. Especially the domains regarding individual animal care and clinical reasoning were well represented. Animal population care and public health were represented the least. We also found that the brochure was in line with the actual training programme for the most part."
The presence and dynamics of sawtooth bars along the ebb-tidal deltas of the wadden islands,"['Heijden, Sanne van der']","['Vegt, Maarten van der']",2021-12-18T00:00:18Z,EN,['Sawtooth bars; ebb-tidal delta; Wadden ; Delft3D ;  bar features ;'],Earth Surface and Water,"Sawtooth bars are located at the downstream side of the ebb-tidal deltas in the Dutch and German Wadden Sea. According to Brakenhoff et al. (2019), they are bar patterns with a down contour orientation of ±25° and with a typical wavelength of 300 to 900 meters. Their crest length is 800 to 2200 meters and they occur at a depth between 3 and 12 meters. Sawtooth bars are 0.5 to 2 meters high and migrate between 2 and 112 meters per year. However, the generation mechanism and the morphological evolution of sawtooth bars have not been studied. Therefore, the objective of this study is to clarify the generation mechanism and the morphological drivers of sawtooth bars.

A Delft3D model was set-up in which the modules FLOW and WAVE (SWAN) were used to model the hydrodynamics and morphodynamics in the study area with the forcing of tides, waves, and wind. Two types of simulations were accomplished, simulations with prescribed sawtooth bars and simulations with a random small amplitude perturbation between ±0.25m in which bars could naturally develop. The simulations with prescribed sawtooth bars were accomplished to study the sensitivity of the bar characteristics and forcing mechanisms on the bar dynamics. The simulations with a random small amplitude perturbation, were accomplished to research the feedback mechanisms that result in the natural development of sawtooth bars. These runs were forced by wind, waves, and tides of which only the significant wave height was a variable. 

The main results show that the alongshore flow, driven by tides, waves and wind, is altered in its direction and magnitude due to the presence of sawtooth bars. As a result of the flow acceleration on the bar crests and the deceleration in the bar troughs, in combination with the down contour orientation of the bars, the resulting tidally averaged flow pattern attempts to follow the depth contours. This flow pattern results in a sediment transport pattern that causes erosion near the updrift side of the bar crest and deposition near the downdrift side of the bar crest. Sediment transport is mainly caused by the forcing of waves in the sawtooth bar area, which is overall suspended load dominated.

Overall, this study shows that sawtooth bars can be generated by stormy weather with high significant wave heights in combination with local high-angle waves, and that bar decay can be a result of fair-weather conditions. More research is necessary on the generation mechanism to find out what the physical key is for bar growth and decay, but this study gives valuable insights to accomplish this."

Here I present a tropical lowland vegetation reconstruction for Eastern Equatorial Africa, for the period 170 to 60 ka covering the African megadrought interval. Based on the stable carbon isotopic composition of terrestrial n-alkane leaf-wax biomarkers preserved in Lake Chala, the proportion of C3 trees and shrubs relative to that of C4 grasses, remained stable at ~55% and ~45%, despite periods of prolonged and severe aridity that is recorded in the seismic stratigraphic record of the lake sediment. High atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the Late Pleistocene, enabled C3 trees and shrubs to outcompete C4 grasses despite substantial moisture balance variation. This study shows that tropical African vegetation is heavily influenced by climatic moisture balance change on short timescales, though on longer timescales appears to follow the main long-term trend in atmospheric CO2."
Instagrammatization: Considering the hypomnesic milieu facilitated by a hybrid social media platform,"['Everts, Daniel']","['Keilbach, Judith']",2021-10-29T09:55:49Z,EN,"['mnemotechnics, mnemotechnology, Stiegler, Instagram, hypomnesic milieu, social media, polarization, memory']","Media, Art and Performance studies","In March of 2021, Facebook Inc. announced plans to develop an advertisement-free version of social media platform Instagram. The plans have been met with strong criticism, which is only the latest in a long line of critique on social media. The field of new media studies, however, is rife with seemingly contradictive appraisals of social media platforms. While some understand them as cash-grabbing monoliths responsible for divisions in society, others see them as merely reflecting societal problems, while yet others understand them as boons to humanity that contribute towards countering those problems.

In part, these contradictive statements can be explained as caused by a general understanding of human society and technology as two separate elements, and a repeated focus on only individual aspects of technology – the way individual technologies function, the possibilities they afford, the way they are used and configured, or the way they operate within constellations of economic power. This thesis presents the philosophy of Bernard Stiegler on memory and technics as a way to overcome the binary opposition between society and technology; the French philosopher understands humanity and technics – tools human beings use to exteriorize memories and carry over experience to future generations – as locked in a perpetual process of mutual becoming.

Stiegler’s philosophical project is explicitly politically engaged. It is aimed at how specific configurations of technics may cause a form of psychological harm that the French philosopher refers to as symbolic misery. According to Stiegler, this symbolic misery first emerged from 20th century mass media and fosters xenophobia, fanaticism and forms of resentment. The aim of this thesis is three-fold: to operationalize Stiegler’s philosophy, to illustrate, through an analysis of the Instagram social media platform, how his philosophical ideas may indeed be useful in empirical research, and to provide new insights into the role Instagram might play within contemporary Western society, especially in regard to its alleged polarization.

After the introduction of some theoretical additions to Stiegler’s philosophy in order to attune it to our contemporary 21st century media landscape, a three-pronged analytical approach is developed that takes together discursive interface analysis with a consideration of Instagram’s selection and ordering algorithms and a consideration of Facebook Inc.’s business model. Based on the analysis, it is found that, due to way Instagram’s current configuration is aimed towards generating advertising revenue, it fosters an environment from which symbolic misery and polarizing tendencies might emerge, while it simultaneously also offers precisely the means necessary to combat these tendencies.

To an extent, these findings nuance Stiegler’s philosophy, which originally states that technics can work either towards or against symbolic misery. The thesis concludes on the thought that, while on paper, an advertisement-free children’s version of Instagram might perhaps not be such a bad idea, it might nevertheless be subjected to the same drawbacks its adult version is subjected too; after all, from a methodological perspective, the discursive interface analysis reveals broader tendencies within contemporary Western society. In any case, as a society, we will have to consider the balance between social media platform’s boons and the drawbacks caused by their subjection to market forces, which might foster symbolic misery, but at the same time do promote the existence of social media platforms in the first place."

Songs for the Greeks: Philhellenism and the Musical Settings of Müller in the German Confederation,"['Juriansz, Nathan']","['Ahrendt, Rebekah']",2021-10-29T10:01:46Z,EN,['Philhellenism; Greece; Greeks; War; Independence; Ottoman; Wilhelm; Müller; Mueller; Poetry; Griechenlieder; Franz; Schubert; Bernhard; Klein; Joseph; Demharter; Ludwig; Berger; Metternich; Censorship; German; Confederation; Prussia; Austria; Ypsilantis; Berlin; Augsburg; Vienna;'],Musicology,"The Greek War of Independence inspired a wide range of artistic responses across Europe, as artists from the domains of literature, the visual arts, and music paid attention to unfolding events on the Peloponnese. Much research has examined French musical responses to the Greek independence movement, largely due to the influence of the French Revolution on the Greek uprising against the Ottoman Empire. Equally significant are responses from German-speaking regions which, like the French, supported the Greek cause both financially and artistically. The musical responses from German-speaking regions, however, are yet to receive sustained scholarly attention.

This thesis demonstrates that the German-speaking world maintained an active interest in the Greek cause through their musical activities. A deep appreciation for Greek culture was widespread across Europe by the early-nineteenth century, and this thesis builds on prior scholarship which argues that philhellenism takes on a political dimension from the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821. Support for the Greek cause appeared from the German literary world through the most outspoken German philhellene Wilhelm Müller (1794-1827), whose series of philhellenic poetry, the “Griechenlieder,” inspired many musical responses. By closely examining selected musical settings inspired by Müller within the socio-political context of the Greece War of Independence, this thesis sheds new light on philhellenism in the German-speaking musical world.

First, a historical overview of the Greek War of Independence and the philhellenic context across the German Confederation will be provided, establishing the context in which Müller and his musical contemporaries created their works. Two benefit concerts will be contrasted as examples of this musical support and situated within this broader political context. The second chapter examines three musical settings of Müller’s philhellenic works. An analysis of Lieder by Berlin-based composers, Ludwig Berger (1777–1839) and Bernhard Klein (1793–1832) demonstrates a contrasting philhellenic musical style to that of the Bavarian Joseph Demharter (1793–). A dedication to the Greeks on the front cover of Klein’s collection of songs also indicates that he participated in a culture of benefit publications. The final chapter examines the social and political context surrounding another work inspired by Müller, albeit in an Austrian context. Given the philhellenism exhibited by Schubert and his circle, the composer’s choice of Müller during the Greek War is arguably a political one and warrants a political reading of Winterreise as a sentiment of philhellenic support. My reading seeks not to negate existing interpretations of a canonic work but, rather, to complement them by considering the extraordinary political circumstances from which the work arose in addition to the political convictions held by the work’s co-creators.

The events of the Greek War evoked many musical responses from philhellenes even beyond the shores of Europe, all of which form part of the story of how Greece gained its independence. This thesis demonstrates that the German-speaking musical world maintained significant interest in the political circumstances of the Greeks through the textual choice of Müller. The creation of musical publications and the participation in musical events dedicated to the Greek cause is indicative of the strong support exhibited by German-speaking territories. Philhellenism in the musical world deserves ongoing attention and is certainly timely, given the recent passing of the 200th anniversary of the beginning of the Greek War of Independence which ultimately led to the international recognition of Greece as an independent state in 1830."

Ik onderzoek welke ambities ten grondslag liggen aan het schoolvak Fries, en in hoeverre die behaald worden. Uit de resultaten voor het Fries distilleer ik een aantal adviezen voor degenen die op het moment van schrijven het onderwijs in het Nedersaksisch aan het vormgeven zijn. Het begrip meertaligheid loopt als een rode draad door de scriptie, expliciet dan wel impliciet.

Mijn informatie voor het Fries haal ik uit wettelijke kaders, de belangrijkste beleidsstukken, een rapportage over het gevoerde beleid en rapporten van adviesorgaan DingTiid en de Inspectie van het Onderwijs. Ik kijk daarbij naar de huidige stand van zaken en naar de ambities voor de toekomst. Samenvattend concludeer ik dat het ondanks de ruime ervaring niet goed gaat met de Friese taal in het onderwijs. Door gebrek aan tijd en bevoegde docenten, door verwachtingen die niet goed zijn afgestemd op de praktijk maar vooral door gebrek aan samenwerking, gedeeld leiderschap en visie en maatschappelijk draagvlak blijkt het Friese onderwijs voor een uitdaging te staan: de positie van het Fries is niet zo sterk als gehoopt. De oplossingen voor die uitdaging worden gezien in betere samenwerking op en tussen alle niveaus. Intussen is men in het Nedersaksische taalgebied juist bezig om initiatieven voor Nedersaksisch onderwijs op te zetten omdat er draagvlak voor is en vraag naar is. De toenemende aandacht voor de meertaligheidsvisie, die zich uit in onder andere de drietalige scholen, blijkt een van de belangrijkste positieve ontwikkelingen die kansen meebrengt voor zowel het Fries als het Nedersaksisch."
Dutch vocational students' experiences in relation to safety and identity negotiation in the context of their educational institute.,"['Abbing, Yara']","['Olivieri, Domitilla']",2021-10-29T10:01:49Z,EN,['Safety; Unsafety; Safe Spaces; Identity; Identity negotiation; Identity visibility; Ideal student; Normativity; Vocational education; Students’ experiences; Educational institutes; STC Group'],Gender Studies,"This thesis examines how students in a Dutch vocational secondary educational institute experience (un)safety, and how this relates to the (conscious or unconscious) act of showing and/or hiding (non)normative aspects of their identities (i.e., identity negotiation). In order to understand the results of this study, (theories on) the dense and relative concepts of safety, safe spaces and identity are unpacked in the context of educational institutes.

With the aim to answer the main research question and sub-questions, qualitative research was conducted at STC Group. STC Group is an educational company within the logistics, technology and maritime sectors offering programmes on a wide range of educational ‘levels’. Ethnographic research was conducted amongst various types of employees of the organisation, in-class discussions were held with seven classes, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 12 vocational students at STC.

During the research, it became apparent that an image of the ideal STC student is implicitly and explicitly expressed by (people within) the school. The ideal student would, according to this polished image, be male, cisgender, white, able-bodied and heterosexual. This mirrors the normative western patriarchal idea of an ideal student, which is highly criticized from a feminist perspective, since the (institutional) norms lead to injustice for those who cannot meet the standards.

In analysing the 12 interviews with students, it furthermore became apparent that the students in this Dutch professional secondary educational institute tend to state they feel (physically) safe, while their other remarks suggest that parts of their educational environments contribute to (perhaps subtle) feelings of (social-emotional) unsafety. This implies that the unsafety, discrimination and expectations regarding ‘normative’ behaviour are internalized to the extent that students seem to accept and adopt discriminatory behaviour and beliefs. As a result, - especially marginalised – individuals negotiate their identities and adjust their behaviour and looks (unconsciously) aiming to fit in, meaning some identity aspects are invigorated/accentuated, and some identity aspects are hidden/watered-down. This thesis forms a basis for future research on vocational students’ perceptions of safety and identity negotiation in educational settings, by making vocational students’ voices be heard, aiming to increase safety and encourage identity visibility in educational institutes."
Revisiting the Berlin German Akkudativ: Evidence for Differential Object Marking,"['Tyrchan, Carolin']","[""D'Alessandro, Roberta""]",2021-10-29T10:01:43Z,EN,['Berlin German; Case; DOM; Microvariation'],Linguistics,"Berlin German (Berlinisch) is known for the 'confusion' of dative and accusative marking, a phenomenon that is known as the Akkudativ. Previous literature concludes that the dialect has a two case system, only distinguishing nominative and oblique/object case, in contrast to High German (Standard German), which distinguishes four cases: nominative, genitive, dative, and accusative. This thesis systematically investigates the distribution of the dative and accusative forms in the dialect, showing that their distribution is in fact systematic and thus delivering counter-evidence to the claim that dative and accusative merge into one unified object case. Original data from questionnaires and elicitations with speakers from Berlin and the surrounding area shows that case marking in Berlin German should be instead analysed as Differential Object Marking (DOM), following a definiteness/specificity, animacy, and possibly gender distinction. In addition, the data shows that the genitive is not ‘lost’ either, as it is still used in possessives and with genitive-licensing prepositions. The animacy distinction can be understood as a level of added complexity, which is reflected in the syntax of DOM objects and dative-form accusatives in PPs. Berlinisch DOM objects are assigned structural accusative, and they do not compete with indirect objects, as some previous accounts of DOM predict. Instead, the mismatch of structural and morphological case can be accounted for by assuming a realisational model of morphology, in which the extra animacy feature gives rise to the spell-out of the dative form rather than the realisation of the underlying structural accusative. The DOM-determining factors can be mapped on a scale, which additionally allows to model synchronic and diachronic variation."
Τhe interaction of language and music: a psycholinguistic approach for a shared pitch mechanism (?),"['Kargakis, Aris']","['Avrutin, Sergey']",2021-10-29T10:01:41Z,EN,"['Keywords: Language, Music, Intonation, Pitch, Shared mechanism.']",Linguistics,"Over the last decades there is an increasing interest in the comparative research between language and music. A significant amount of studies has focused on the shared underlying processes in both domains (e.g. Patel et al., 1998; Patel, 2003; Slevc et al., 2009; Fedorenko et al., 2009, Jiang et al., 2010). While evidence is contradictory (e.g. Peretz, 1993; 2008; Peretz et al., 1994; Peretz & Coltheart 2003;
Chen et al., 2018), no prior research denies the apparent similarities of language and music with respect to the structural rules and principles required for the linguistic and musical adequacy. Following previous claims that intonation shapes the word boundaries eliminating sentence ambiguities (Papangeli & Marinis, 2010), the present research thesis proposes a self-paced reading-listening experiment to investigate whether musical pitch can substitute the use of intonation in ambiguous contexts. As a result, it would indicate that non-linguistic acoustic cues, such as music pitch, may
contribute to language comprehension, specifically to disambiguation. This is expected to become evident through the comparison of reading times across ambiguous and non ambiguous (control) conditions, under high, neutral and low musical pitch exposure. The results show that although there are indications that high musical pitch exposure facilitates processing of the ambiguous sentences, it did not reach significance, rejecting the experimental hypothesis. However, the present thesis concludes that language and music might share a common pitch mechanism. Such findings could further contribute to our understanding of the brain organization and the underlying shared general cognitive mechanisms. Lastly, it could also be departure for treatment approaches from unimpaired domains to impaired ones in clinical cases such as, aphasia and amusia."
The Sinking Tribe: Neocolonial Discourse and Indigenous Counter-Discourse in the Biloxi-Chitimacha Choctaw Resettlement,"[""O'Donnell, Elaine""]","['Trakilovic, M']",2021-10-29T10:01:47Z,EN,['discourse; counter-discourse; power/knowledge; Indigenous knowledges; neocolonialism; decolonisation; resettlement'],Gender Studies,"Rising sea levels are forcing coastal communities across the globe to relocate to safer ground. In southern Louisiana, the Isle de Jean Charles is sinking rapidly as floods are expected to completely submerge the island in 30-50 years. The island is home to the Biloxi-Chitimacha Choctaw tribe, whose need to resettle has become an area of contention within wider Louisianian society. Dubbed America’s first ‘climate refugees’, the tribe has faced continual disappointment and broken promises from the state regarding their resettlement. Oil companies working within the state have also rejected claims their excavation has added to the rising waters, leaving the coastal communities embroiled in a bitter lawsuit. Within this thesis, I trace elements of neocoloniality through texts from the state and the oil companies to demonstrate how normative discourse surrounding the resettlement functions to uphold hegemonic, Eurocentric ideologies. Using an explicitly feminist critical discourse analytical methodology, I examine the practices of othering, presentation of neocolonial knowledges and the silencing of Indigenous voices as mechanisms within the discourse which the state and oil industry employ to suppress alternative readings of the resettlement. Offering a counter to this, I engage with a counter-discursive methodological framework to centralise the perspectives of the Biloxi-Chitimacha Choctaw tribe. This suggests an alternative reading of the hegemonic narrative represented in the neocolonial discourse, contrasting the objective and universalising narratives of the normative discourse by presenting themes of invasion and legacies of violence. Embedded in feminist and decolonial principles, my analysis examines how discourse can be deconstructed to clear space for historically marginalised voices and usher in a decolonial approach to language and representation."

The Uyghurs are an indigenous Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim, ethno-religious minority who are being repressed and have to face severe human rights violations in their homeland East Turkestan: the officially termed Xinjiang province, situated in the People's Republic of China. Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States, China has framed the Uyghur situation as their own legitimate “war on terror” by labelling Uyghurs terrorists, with the aim to legitimize its repressive actions. By labelling Uyghurs as a terrorist threat, Uyghurs are being securitized. This securitization has transcended to other places in the world where Uyghurs live. One of these p laces is the Netherlands, where Uyghurs today are still being harassed and intimidated by China, despite having fled their homeland. This is done through a variety of “extraordinary” transnational repressive measures, among which coercion-by-proxy. Since 2017, these “extraordinary measures” have intensified, following China’s domestic security strategy shift. During this shift, China changed its repression approach from selective to collective. This has affected the Uyghur community in the Netherlands by creating an atmosphere of fear and control. This thesis has found self-censorship being the most crucial effect, supported by feelings of anxiety, suspicion, and alienation."
Teruggave van 'Roofkunst' in het journalistieke discourse.

gelijkheid en andere postkoloniale vraagstukken. Zo is er een wereldwijde beweging opgestart rond
‘Black Lives Matter’, die op 20 juni 2020 ook in Nederland is neergestreken op de Dam (Trouw, 2020).
Daarnaast bood onze koning voor het eerst officieel zijn excuses aan voor het koloniale verleden in
Indonesië (NOS, 2020) en kreeg er voor het eerst een Surinamer die zich inzette voor de Surinaamse
onafhankelijkheid, de schrijver Anton de Kom, een plaats in de officiële geschiedeniscanon van
Nederland (Cloin, 2020). Ook in 2020 kwam de Adviescommissie Koloniale Collecties op 7 oktober
met een advies aan de Tweede Kamer dat alle in Nederland aanwezige ‘roofkunst’ zonder voorwaarden
terug moet naar het land van herkomst, wanneer dit land hier om vraagt (Kruijt, 2020). Dit onderzoek
kijkt naar hoe er over roofkunst en koloniale cultuurgoederen en de mogelijke teruggave hiervan wordt
gesproken in Nederlandse dagbladen in de periode van 16 oktober 2020, toen de adviescommissie werd
opgericht, tot 31 oktober 2020.
De manier waarop Nederlandse kranten een rol spelen in dit maatschappelijk belangrijke thema maakt
het onderzoek relevant omdat kranten over het algemeen stellen onafhankelijk en objectief verslag te
doen van de actualiteiten. Hierom zijn 39 artikelen uit de dagbladen Algemeen Dagblad, De Telegraaf,
NRC Handelsblad, Trouw en de Volkskrant onderworpen aan een handmatige inhoudsanalyse en een
framinganalyse (Semetko & Valkenburg; 2000; Van Noije & Wennekers; 2019). Hiermee kon ook
wetenschappelijk worden aangetoond of, zoals gezien in eerdere onderzoeken, de kwaliteitskranten
(Scholten & Bakker, 2019) NRC Handelsblad, Trouw en de Volkskrant meer frames gebruiken dan de
populaire kranten Algemeen Dagblad en De Telegraaf.
Uit het onderzoek bleek dat het onderwerp heel selectief interessant gevonden werd. De artikelen over
het onderwerp gingen veelal over het advies van de adviescommissie of deze commissie werd op zijn
minst een keer aangehaald. Hiernaast werd er aan het onderwerp enkel aandacht geschonken wanneer
er een incident plaatsvond als de bekladding van of de diefstal uit een museum. Hierbij kon worden
bevestigd dat de kwaliteitskranten in veel hogere mate gebruik maakten van frames dan de populaire
kranten. Hierbij kwam het verantwoordelijkheidsframe het meest voor en Nederland werd ‘geframed’
als de verantwoordelijke. Het sentiment tegenover teruggave was hierbij bij de kwaliteitskranten ook
veel positiever en er werden meer argumenten voor gegeven dan tegen. Bij de populaire kranten was dit
precies andersom.
Toekomstig onderzoek zou vooral moeten kijken naar wat er wordt gezegd in het journalistieke
discourse door het uitvoeren van een kritische discoursanalyse. Nu we weten welke frames er worden
gebruikt, is het interessant om te kijken hoe dit zich vertaalt in de specifieke inhoud van de artikelen.
Ook kan het in zijn algemeenheid interessant zijn om te kijken of de reputatie van de dagbladen rond
framing ook geldt wanneer je onderzoek doet naar minder beladen maatschappelijke thema’s."

The first is Americans’ motivation to learn Dutch, and the second is their evaluations of interactions with Dutch interlocutors. Participants’ stories are discussed through the framework of complexity in intercultural communication, supported by ideas concerning language learning motivation and accommodation strategies, as well as Schumann’s

The results indicate that participants are highly motivated to learn Dutch through a variety of internal and external factors, and they have varying opinions on what constitutes over- and under-accommodation. Americans’ intentions to use either English or Dutch depend on their communicative goals, which may change from one interaction to another. Communication between Americans and Dutch people is complex, because the meanings that Americans interpret from their interactions depend on their perceptions of themselves and their interlocutors, as well as their interlocutors’ perceptions of them."

Several moral frameworks are provided that help to think about why the conduct of the ECB can be problematic. First, the libertarian argument argues that everyone should be able to issue legal tender and that the redistributive effects by ECB policies are unjust. However, actually implementing free banking brings with too much uncertainty, therefore no serious policy proposal can be grounded on libertarianism. Second, the framework based on egalitarianism shows that the ECB is complicit in exacerbating already problematic wealth and incomes inequalities. While officials of the ECB have tried to debunk criticisms by saying that the ECB should only strive for price stability, this answer no longer satisfies. Precisely because the ECB has stepped into the political realm by exacerbating inequality and implementing political purchase programmes. In addition, a lot of pre-GFC assumptions do not hold true anymore. The ECB has widened its mandate without democratic legitimization and it lacks the competencies needed for moral decision making which impairs quality of policy. Moreover, a problematic reliance on the financial sector has emerged in the last few decades and the ECB lacks a self-correcting mechanism which produces epistemological problems. In my view, it is time for a new paradigm for the ECB. This paper suggests several reform proposals that tackle the respective problems of inequality, dependency on the financial sector and problematic knowledge production. It is up to further research to determine exactly what kind of reform proposal can be implemented and what benefit and negative consequences they might accrue. For now, this paper has explored all the options, including maintain the status quo, by morally scrutinizing the ECB step by step."

The series provided for an intense effect as chess sales and online participation in chess games rouse to new extremes. As the protagonist, Beth is one of the main components of the show and therefore this paper researches the connection between Beth and the increase in chess popularity. Previous scholarly evidence has determined that character engagement can be measured by looking at viewer’s level of identification, wishful identification, parasocial interaction and likeability (measured in this study by positive characteristics). As The Queen’s Gambit is based in America it is interesting to see the differences and similarities between the levels of character engagement of viewers from the same country and viewers from another country. Therefore, the respondents of this study were from both the Netherlands and the United States. Through an online questionnaire and six interviews it was found that American viewers rate Beth more positively while Dutch viewers rate chess more positively. Furthermore, it was determined that American viewers opinion on Beth does not influence their ideas and interests in chess at all. Thus, American respondents with a more positive feeling towards Beth did not feel more positively towards chess, start playing chess more or buy chess equipment. Moreover, viewers from the Netherlands did let their level of wishful identification with Beth influence their opinion on chess and participating behaviour. Dutch viewers who wanted to be like Beth were more likely to think more positively of chess and play more chess games after watching the show. Even though the Dutch viewers let their opinion on Beth change their attitude towards chess a bit more, it was still not a lot. The similar results for both Dutch and American viewers indicate to the idea that nationality might not cause as many differences as was once thought."

School-gerelateerde factoren blijken hiervoor een mogelijke verklaring te bieden. Educatieve uitgaven kunnen de school-gerelateerde factoren beïnvloeden, omdat ze zowel de leerkracht ondersteuning bieden als lesstof aanbieden aan de leerlingen. 
In deze scriptie is er onderzoek gedaan naar de aandacht voor meertaligheid in de educatieve uitgaven van twee Zweedse educatieve uitgeverijen en naar hun evaluatie door Zweedse ervaringsdeskundigen. Er is gekozen om de Zweedse situatie te onderzoeken, omdat Zweden een vergelijkbaar percentage inwoners heeft met een buitenlandse achtergrond als Nederland. Zweden heeft echter betere formele rechten voor leerlingen met een migratieachtergrond. Aan de hand van de resultaten van dit onderzoek kan worden bepaald wat de Nederlandse educatieve uitgeverijen kunnen leren van de Zweedse situatie. 
Het eerste deel van het onderzoek bestaat uit een inductieve analyse van de aandacht voor meertaligheid in de educatieve uitgaven en het tweede deel van het onderzoek bestaat uit een interviewanalyse om de evaluatie van de educatieve uitgaven vast te stellen. In de educatieve uitgaven zijn vijf manieren gevonden om aandacht te besteden aan meertaligheid. Zo is er algemene ondersteuning van alle leerlingen, ondersteuning gericht op leerlingen met een andere thuistaal, meerdere talen in de les, impliciete gelijkwaardigheid en meta-aandacht voor meertaligheid. Aspecten van translanguaging en functioneel meertalig leren werden echter niet teruggevonden in de educatieve uitgaven.
	De evaluatie van de educatieve uitgaven is onderverdeeld in twee delen: bruikbaarheid en waardering. Wat betreft de bruikbaarheid blijkt dat er een aantal maatschappelijke en onderwijskundige uitdagingen zijn die eerst moeten worden opgelost, voordat educatieve uitgaven daadwerkelijk bruikbaar kunnen zijn. Een belangrijk aspect hiervan is meer kennis van en ervaring met meertaligheid bij leraren en ook bij directeuren en het bredere publiek. De ervaringsdeskundigen waardeerden de educatieve uitgaven van Binogi beter dan de uitgaven van NE, voornamelijk vanwege de betere toepasbaarheid van Binogi. 
	Wat betreft de Zweedse situatie blijkt dat het overwinnen van de maatschappelijke en onderwijskundige uitdagingen de prioriteit moet krijgen en dat de lesmethodes op de tweede plek staan. Educatieve uitgeverijen kunnen de aandacht voor meertaligheid in hun lesmethodes ondertussen wel vergroten. Voor de Nederlandse situatie is dit eveneens relevant, omdat wetenschappelijke onderzoekers kunnen nagaan in welke mate er maatschappelijke of onderwijskundige uitdagingen de onderwijspraktijk hinderen en hoe deze kunnen worden opgelost. De Nederlandse educatieve uitgeverijen kunnen daarnaast, geleid door de onderzoeksresultaten, nagaan hoe de aandacht voor meertaligheid kan worden vergroot in hun educatieve uitgaven. Op deze manier kunnen de gelijke leerkansen in het Nederlandse onderwijssysteem verder worden bevorderd voor alle leerlingen."

Meritocracy does not legitimize inequality for everyone,"['Berkel, Jacco van']","['Kommer, Victor van']",2021-10-28T12:30:13Z,EN,"['Meritocracy, Inequality, Social Status, OLS, Political Attitudes,']",Economic Policy,"Inequality has been rising in the West over the past decades. Although most scholars consider this to be a worrying trend, it has not always been met with greater public concern nor higher public support for redistribution. To understand what shapes people’s concerns about inequality and redistributive preferences, scholars are increasingly examining the role of meritocratic beliefs. Scholars presume and have found empirical evidence that such beliefs lower people’s inequality concerns and their redistributive preferences. However, what these scholars fail to consider is that this relationship might depend on one’s socio-economic position. As meritocratic beliefs entail that economic success is the result of hard work and effort, they implicitly accredit the wealthy for their success and blame the poor for their fate. Such beliefs therefore affect the social status of the two groups in different ways, as in a meritocracy, being poor comes with a lower and being rich with a higher social status. In this paper, I argue that for low-income individuals, the so-called meritocratic ‘losers’, meritocratic beliefs do not lead to lower concerns nor lower redistributive preferences because of how such beliefs affect their social status and self-esteem. Using data from the LISS dataset , containing a representative sample of the Netherlands, I find evidence in support of this claim. While meritocratic beliefs lead to reduced concerns about inequality and lower redistributive preferences for those with a high income, no such relationship exists for those with a low income. This can be explained by the mediating role of people’s perceptions of the fairness of the economic system. While for the rich, believing to live in a meritocracy makes them consider their economic system to be fair and these beliefs therefore legitimize current inequalities, for the poor, meritocratic beliefs do not affect their perceptions of fairness and these beliefs consequently do not serve as a legitimization of inequalities."

In plaats van ‘een nieuw geluid’ te laten horen, gaat de culturele voorhoede op zoek naar manieren om het verleden in nieuwe muziek te verwerken, door muziekjournalist Simon Reynolds getypeerd als ‘retromania’. Aan retromanische muziek kleeft onvermijdelijk een gevoel van nostalgie naar het verleden waarnaar verwezen wordt, maar dat lijkt artiesten er niet van te weerhouden om progressief gekleurde maatschappijkritische muziek of protestmuziek te maken. Binnen het huidige landschap van Nederlandstalige muziek zijn het onder andere levensliedzangeres Sophie Straat en punkband Hang Youth die hun maatschappijkritiek in de vorm van een sterk retromanisch oeuvre gieten. Deze scriptie heeft deze relatie tussen heden en verleden, tussen retromania, nostalgie en maatschappijkritiek in Nederlandse muziek onderzocht, aan de hand van de hoofdvraag ‘Wat is de rol van retromania en nostalgie in de protestmuziek van levensliedzangeres Sophie Straat en punkband Hang Youth?’, tegen de achtergrond van de kernconcepten retromania, nostalgie en ironie, en de geschiedenis en culturele status van het levenslied en de punkbeweging. De postureanalyse heeft laten zien dat Sophie Straat elementen van haar biografische persoon inzet om de geloofwaardigheid en authenticiteit van Sophie Straat als levensliedzangeres te vergroten. Er is een groot verschil waarneembaar tussen het intratekstuele Amsterdamse en het extratekstuele, intellectuele en Haagse posture van Straat: op intratekstueel niveau is de nostalgie restoratief, maar op extratekstueel niveau geeft Straat blijk van een zeer reflectieve vorm van nostalgie. Bij de punkband Hang Youth is sprake van een vorm van nostalgie genaamd hauntology, naar de belofte van de punkbeweging. Hang Youth uit dit binnen een Post-Internetcontext, waarin online en offline, verschillende media en de biogra fische perso(o)n(en) en de artiest sterk met elkaar verbonden zijn. Het effect van het oeuvre van Hang Youth lijkt op die manier verder te gaan dan alleen bewustwording. Bij zowel Sophie Straat als Hang Youth interfereert de retromania (de vorm) ook met de inhoud van het oeuvre, maar dit wordt door de artiesten niet sterk ingezet of benoemd."
Disobedient Movement: The Biopolitical Subject and Pushbacks in the Greece-Turkey Borderzone,"['Pawson, Melissa']","['Slooter, Luuk']",2021-10-29T10:02:09Z,EN,['Greece; Turkey; EU; Frontex; border; pushbacks; migration; people on the move; asylum seekers; disobedience; biopolitics; thanatopolitics; structurationism; racism; violence; human rights'],Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"In the year 2020, pushbacks across the Greece-Turkey border, a practice by which Greece and the EU unlawfully expels people on the move from the territory, increased and intensified (Refugees International 2020, Legal Centre Lesvos 2020). Despite many making lawful requests for asylum, or being in possession of valid residency documentation, people on the move continue to be expelled in high numbers via violent and unlawful means. This study is based on remote research conducted with fieldworkers and people on the move with lived experience in Turkey, Greece and Norway, through six in-depth interviews. Additionally, 107 testimonies of pushbacks in 2020 were coded and analysed, all of which are published on open-source websites. Drawing from theories of biopolitics (Foucault 2003), thanatopolitics (Agamben 1995) and structurationism (Giddens 1986), this thesis establishes a new analytical frame to elucidate the empirical case of pushbacks in the Greece-Turkey borderzone: disobedient movement in a rightless zone. This frame informs an understanding of the “mutually constitutive” relationship between structure (the sovereign state of Greece and the EU) and agent (the person on the move) in the borderzone (Giddens 1986, xxx). The borderzone is defined in the thesis as both a physical space and an everywhere space which operates as a rightless zone, implemented by the biopolitical sovereign state. The rightless zone forms the first part of the analytical frame, which examines how people on the move, and those perceived to be on the move, are subjected to illicit and violent practices by the sovereign state. This is analysed through the following indicators: revoking papers, borderzone detention, expulsion and making die. The second part of the frame, disobedient movement, examines how people on the move move disobediently through the borderzone, shown through three indicators of persistence, ingenuity and solidarity. In doing so, they defy and challenge the sovereign power which attempts to control them. This is one of the first papers to systematically research pushback practices and people on the move’s responses to them. In doing so, this study offers a significant academic and social contribution through the addition of a new analytical frame, through the exposing of brutal and unlawful state measures exercised at the EU’s borders, and through a long-awaited recognition and examination of people on the move’s agency and disobedience in the borderzone."

"‘Bedankt, lieve moeder dat u zo modern bent’: Moderniteitsdiscoursen en het Nederlands publiek abortusdebat tussen 1966 en 1984","['Schoonen, Anoek']","['Kennedy, James']",2021-10-29T10:02:04Z,NL,"['Abortus; moderniteit, moderniteitsdiscours; publiek debat; geschiedenis; Nederland; jaren zestig; jaren zeventig; jaren tachtig; Agnes Heller; Marin Terpstra; vrouwenemancipatie']",Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"Nederland was tussen 1966 en 1984 in de greep van een publiek debat over de legalisering van abortus provocatus. Moderniteitsdiscoursen werden in dit debat zowel door voorstanders als tegenstanders van abortuslegalisering aangehaald. In deze scriptie worden deze moderniteitsdiscoursen geanalyseerd aan de hand van de moderniteitstheorieën van de Hongaarse filosofe Agnes Heller en de Nederlandse politiek filosoof Marin Terpstra. Deze twee moderniteitstheorieën hebben verschillende benaderingen jegens moderniteit. Heller ziet moderniteit als een sociale werkelijkheid die door dwingende logica’s gevormd wordt. Terwijl Terpstra veronderstelt dat moderniteit een construct is en dat het slechts betrekking heeft op de manier waarop een samenleving duiding geeft aan gebeurtenissen. Aan de hand van deze analyse komen een aantal ontwikkelingen in de destijds gebruikte moderniteitsdiscoursen aan het licht. 

Zo waren het tussen 1966 en 1971 vooral de tegenstanders van abortuslegalisering die de tijd als maatstaf aanhaalden. Daarentegen gingen voorstanders in deze periode de strijd aan met ‘oude’ ethische normen door de rationaliteit en validiteit daarvan aan te vallen. Opmerkelijk is dat sommige tegenstanders van abortuslegalisering zichzelf al ouderwets noemden, terwijl legaliseringsvoorstanders hen nog niet zo bestempelden. Toen het abortusdebat tussen 1972 en 1976 in het teken kwam te staan van discussies over het zelfbeschikkingsrecht van de vrouw versus de bescherming van ‘het ongeboren kind’ vond een geleidelijke verschuiving plaats in het gebruik van moderniteitdiscoursen. Voorstanders van abortuslegalisering begonnen vaker naar moderniteitsdiscoursen te grijpen en tegenstanders etaleerden in grotere mate een dedain tegenover de ‘moderne’ maatschappij. De verschuiving leek in 1977-1984 voltooid te zijn. Nu waren het voornamelijk voorstanders van abortuslegalisering die moderniteit als maatstaf inzetten. 

Gedurende het hele publiek abortusdebat bleef strijd bestaan over de rechtvaardigheid en moderniteit – dan wel ouderwetsheid – van abortus. Uit de analyse blijkt dat slechts door de moderniteitsvisies van Terpstra en Heller te combineren een grondige moderniteitsdiscoursanalyse kan plaatsvinden. Daarbij wordt tevens zichtbaar dat de inzet van moderniteitsdiscoursen in grote mate afhankelijk is van ontwikkelingen in de bestaande cultuur en praktijk. In het abortusdebat werd het gebruik van moderniteitsdiscoursen vermoedelijk beïnvloed door de komst van de anticonceptiepil en de abortusklinieken, de bredere vrouwenemancipatie en veranderingen in seksuele normen."
Clustering Monolingual Vocabularies to Improve Cross-Lingual Generalization,"['Bassani, Riccardo']","['Deoskar, Tejaswini']",2021-10-29T10:02:10Z,EN,['cross-lingual LMs; mBERT; ICEBERT; subword tokenization; subword clustering;'],Artificial Intelligence,"Multi-lingual language models based on multi-lingual BERT (mBERT) have made it possible to perform linguistic tasks on virtually any language for which some raw text data is available. Through a particular type of transfer learning, these models exploit the large amount of data available for resource-rich languages like English and then apply what they learn when handling low-resource languages. This happens both in the pre-training phase, where low-resource languages' data would not be enough for the model to train, and in the fine-tuning phase, where labeled data is often available only for a few languages. Multi-lingual language models, however, exhibit better performance for some languages than for others, and many languages do not seem to benefit from multi-lingual sharing at all. The broad goal of this thesis is to improve the performance of multi-lingual models on low-resource languages. We focus on two issues: First, to create a better multi-lingual representational space where text tokens are represented independently of the language to which they belong. Second, to improve multi-lingual segmentation. In current work, indeed, low-resource languages are segmented with a tokenizer mainly trained on resource-rich languages text, thus yielding sub-optimal segmentation for low-resource languages. Instead, we use a dedicated tokenizer and a large subword vocabulary for better segmentation of each language. We then use a clustering algorithm to discover sensible multi-lingual groupings of segments across languages. A multi-lingual BERT model is then trained on the obtained clusters. In this work, we focused on two issues that presumably cause this phenomenon. First, the models' difficulties in creating a multi-lingual representational space, where. Second, the poor multi-lingual segmentation adopted: low-resource languages are segmented with a tokenizer mainly trained on resource-rich languages text, thus yielding sub-optimal segmentation. To guarantee a fair segmentation of all languages, we propose to use a dedicated tokenizer and a large subword vocabulary for each language. In order to allow the use of large monolingual vocabularies, and to increase the multi-linguality of the representational space, we cluster monolingual segments grouping together tokens which are similar across languages, and train a BERT model on the obtained clusters. Not only does this allows to use the aforementioned large vocabularies, without increasing the multi-lingual model capacity, but it also yields a truly interlingual model, which learns how to represent language-neutral semantic clusters, instead of language-specific text tokens as in traditional BERT-like models. We called this model ICEBERT, standing for Interlingual-Clusters Enhanced BERT. We show significant improvements over standard multi-lingual segmentation and training in a question answering task covering nine languages, both in a small model regime and in a BERT-base training regime, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our clustering. The proposed approach could be easily expanded to more languages, or applied to model architectures different from mBERT."
Genetic interactions in pediatric cancer – Current state and outlook,"['Gremmen, Richard']","['Daub, Josephine']",2021-10-29T10:02:08Z,EN,['epistasis;pediatric cancer'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Kanker is een ziekte van het DNA. Mutaties in het DNA zorgen ervoor dat genen zich anders gaan gedragen. Ze kunnen er aan bijdragen bij dat cellen zich als kankercellen ontwikkelen, bijvoorbeeld door ongebreidelde groei te vertonen. Genen opereren echter niet altijd onafhankelijk, ze hebben invloed op elkaar. Wanneer dat zo is, spreken we van genetische interacties. Dat leidt ertoe dat sommige mutaties vaak samen optreden omdat ze een voordeel voor de tumor opleveren, of dat mutaties juist minder vaak samen voorkomen (of helemaal niet) omdat de combinatie van mutaties ziekmakend of dodelijk is voor de kankercel. De laatste situatie noemen we synthetische dodelijkheid. Het legt een kwetsbaarheid bloot van een tumor die al één van de mutaties heeft. Door nu op te zoek te gaan naar deze combinaties kan de ontwikkeling van kanker beter begrepen worden en kunnen er mogelijke nieuwe behandelmethodes ontwikkeld worden. Voor volwassen kanker is dat al gelukt met gerichte therapie met een medicijn dat als PARP-remmer werkt (PARP is een gen). Daar kunnen patienten met een tumor met een mutatie in een ander gen, het BRCA1- of BRCA2-gen baat bij hebben. Voor kinderkanker is zoiets nog minder toegepast. Omdat er grote verschillen tussen kinder- en volwassenkanker zijn kunnen behandelingen ook niet makkelijk overgenomen worden. Dit verslag gaat over de zoektocht naar nieuwe genetische interacties die specifiek voor kinderkanker zijn. We bespreken de experimentele en statistische methoden en de resultaten die daarmee behaald zijn. We zien dat kinderkanker zeldzamer is en er daardoor ook minder data beschikbaar zijn die in de zoektocht kunnen helpen. Het kan helpen om ook andere soorten mutaties in het DNA en afwijkend gedrag van genen mee te nemen, niet alleen de kleine mutaties van het DNA, om meer data beschikbaar te hebben. Het kan ook voordeel leveren data van meerdere onderzoeksinstituten te combineren. In het verslag worden een aantal mogelijkheden en uitdagingen genoemd om deze data optimaal te combineren, zodat de zoektocht naar genetische interacties in kinderkanker bespoedigd wordt. We verwachten dat studies die hier gebruik van maken nieuwe genetische interacties in kinderkanker zullen vinden en uiteindelijk kunnen helpen bij de ontwikkeling van nieuwe behandelingen."

In order to see the future development of the minority in Helsinki, it is crucial to understand the present situation in relation to young bilinguals’ identification processes. Therefore, this study aims to explore the identification processes of the Swedish minority of Finland. Specifically, the goal is to investigate the factors that influence whether or not young bilinguals in Helsinki identify with the Finnish-Swedish minority. The study also aims to answer how their linguistic and cultural identities affect their identification with the Finnish-Swedish minority, as well as what their attitudes are toward the Finnish-Swedish minority itself. 

A qualitative and inductive method was chosen in order to answer the research questions. Ethnographic interviews were conducted with five participants. A textual analysis was conducted in five stages. More specifically, the data was analysed by a thematic analysis to identify broad themes and patterns. The results showed patterns in the participants’ linguistic and cultural identities in relation to their linguistic backgrounds and experiences. Stereotypes and nationalism were also important themes in regard to attitudes toward the Finnish-Swedish minority. Moreover, both essentialist and fluid perspectives emerged in relation to culture. 

The factors that influence whether or not young bilinguals in Helsinki identify with the Finnish-Swedish minority are concluded as linguistic backgrounds and the language in which they attended school. Moreover, the attitudes held by the young bilinguals toward the minority itself influence their own identification. The final factor is context, as this study found that the participants’ identities are fluid and shift depending on situations and social interactions."
De Copenhagen Internationale Dyslexietoet,"['Aydin, Selcan']","['Boerma, Tessel']",2021-10-29T10:02:07Z,NL,[],Meertaligheid en taalverwerving,"Dyslexie is moeilijk te diagnosticeren in een tweede taal. Zwakke prestaties op een leestest in een tweede taal kunnen namelijk worden veroorzaakt door een slechte taalvaardigheid of beperkte scholing zonder dat sprake is van een slecht leesvermogen. In de Internationale SchakelKlassen (ISK), die onderwijs bieden aan jongeren die Nederlands als tweede taal leren, is het (nog) niet mogelijk om onderscheid te maken tussen leesproblemen die veroorzaakt worden door een lage taalvaardigheid (door beperkte blootstelling) in een bepaalde taal en leesproblemen die veroorzaakt worden door fonologische problemen (oftewel: dyslexie). 
Om dyslexie in een tweede taal in een zo vroeg mogelijk stadium te diagnosticeren en een behandeling te kunnen starten, is het belangrijk om een dyslexiescreeningstaak in te zetten die dit onderscheid wel kan maken. Dit is nodig omdat het vaak niet mogelijk is om de leesvaardigheid te testen in beide talen of in de moedertaal van een individu vanwege een gebrek aan instrumenten in bepaalde talen of het ontbreken van professionals die een bepaalde taal spreken. Dit maakt het soms noodzakelijk om te testen in de tweede taal terwijl sprake is van beperkte ervaring in die taal. 
De huidige pilotstudie onderzocht of een recent ontwikkelde dynamische dyslexietoets (Elbro, Daugaard, & Gellert, 2012) die taalonafhankelijk is, kan bijdragen aan een tijdige diagnose van dyslexie bij adolescenten in de ISK. De deelnemers van de studie waren zes tweedetaalleerders en twee moedertaalsprekers van het Nederlands tussen de 12 en 18 jaar oud. Van vier tweedetaalleeerders was bekend dat zij leesproblemen hadden. In de dynamische toets leren de deelnemers drie nieuwe letters en wordt getest of zij nieuwe woorden kunnen maken met deze letterklanken. De resultaten van het onderzoek gaven aan dat met de dynamische toets onderscheid kan worden gemaakt tussen adolescenten met en zonder leesproblemen."

The Dutch Agency for Cultural Heritage focuses on raising awareness about the importance of interior-ensembles. Currently, these ensembles are in danger of splitting up, being sold or damaged. Because the phenomenon is international, this research looks beyond borders to discover inspirational examples of how to preserve interior-ensembles.
With the use of the heritage theories Spirit of Place and the ‘sector, factor, vector’ concept, this thesis focuses on how foreign countries deal with the conservation of interior-ensembles and how these approaches can be inspirational for the conservation of Dutch ensembles. The research focuses on three case studies to gain a deeper understanding of how the interior-ensemble is understood and preserved within their specific context. The case studies are the Anchers Hus in Denmark, the Rotes Haus in Germany, and Skoklosters Slott in Sweden. Using a biographical methodology, an analysis is made of the history of the interior-ensembles and the way in which they present their story to the world. With a critical discourse analysis, as used within the Authorized Heritage Discourse, the leading international discourse on the preservation of historic interiors is analysed and identified.
In conclusion, I argue that the analyses of the case studies show that there are many ways of understanding and preserving interior-ensembles. The case studies move from a static sector-approach to a more dynamic vector-approach. This dynamic way of conserving the interior-ensemble seems to add multiple advantages. By developing the interior-ensemble, a broader awareness is created, while the gain of many perspectives and stories do more justice to the story of the interior-ensemble. The ensembles of Anchers Hus and Skoklosters Slott show how their interiors are used to keep developing the story of their location. The Rotes Haus shows how an interior-ensemble can be used to tell the story of a regional identity. And in Denmark, where, as in The Netherlands, mobile objects are not legally protected as monuments, they offer advice and financial support for mobile objects if an extraordinary relationship with the building is present.
The insights provided by the analysis of the case studies create a more comprehensive and broader understanding of how interior-ensembles can be preserved. The research identifies valuable starting points that offer inspiring possibilities for a better conservation of interior-ensembles in The Netherlands."

combination with a contextual assessment of the workings of social media, algorithmic
filtering, and the American political system. To understand how Trump used Twitter, 2.004
Tweets of Trump between October 1, 2020 – January 8, 2021 were qualitatively analyzed and
coded. This research demonstrates that Trump’s delegitimization attempts were a slippery
slope, with first the media and political opponents, then the elections and ultimately his own
party members and the whole American political system as such as targets of his
delegitimization. This culminated with the organized ‘Save America Rally’ on January 6,
2021, where hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in D.C. to #StoptheSteal.
Through the Tweet analysis of this research, it was discovered that Trump assembled different
cultural, historical and conspiratorial narratives in his Tweets to delegitimize American
institutions and create an authoritative truth: one where it is impossible that Trump lost the
elections. This research shows how violence can be incited by a President by continuously
delegitimizing the political establishment and flirting with conspiracy ideas. It furthermore
stresses how research on social media should evolve into policy recommendations to control
the economic imperatives of algorithms that drive online polarization which in turn can
manifest itself as offline violence."

I have conducted semi-structured interviews with five women to gain a deeper understanding of their lived experiences with contraception and the pill in particular. I deconstruct the notion of ‘choice’ that surrounds the usage of the pill, by showing how women’s contraceptive decision making is structured by wider sociopolitical factors. Women’s options and ability to choose are based on a trajectory that society laid out for them, namely to use hormonal contraceptives. Rejecting this path would mean having significantly less options and to break with gendered norms and expectations of contraception. I will link the illusion of choice to reproductive autonomy, and question to what extent women nowadays feel like they have agency when it comes to their reproductive choices. My analysis shows that with regard to reproductive autonomy, being well-protected against a pregnancy is the top priority. Consequently, in a landscape without sufficient effective male contraceptives or non-hormonal contraceptives, women feel the need to let go of their ethical concerns and use hormonal contraception like the pill. Furthermore, I discuss the importance and possibilities of making contraception a shared responsibility, for which trust seems to be a key aspect."

literature (e.g. Heelas, 2008). This study, employing a micropolitical analysis, expanded on this 
notion by looking at a loose Pagan group as a new spirituality with explicit communal and 
environmentalist values next to individualism. Using Robbins’ (2007) ideas, it is argued that the 
apparent paradox of simultaneous individualism and communalism-environmentalism is 
reconciled by relegating the former to environmentalist methods, the latter to ends. Four Pagan 
spiritual beliefs reflect this reconciliation: the beliefs of fundamental human potential to live 
harmoniously with the planet and community; the beliefs of work on the self leading to wider 
change, and vice versa; the beliefs of insights beyond the ordinary self, used to question one’s 
methods and ends; and the beliefs in magic as dealing with unstoppable processes, including the 
planet’s self-healing. All these beliefs increase possibilities of environmentalist action and foster 
hope in practitioners. It is argued that this happens spiritually through a Pagan kind of 
enchantment, which is extended beyond the individual towards communalism-environmentalism, 
challenging the status quo intentionally. This hope further motivates environmentalist action, 
which is informed by the described beliefs and value reconciliation. Here, small-scale action and
idealism are frequently employed. Idealism can foster hope in others while small-scale actions
generally do not need “audiences” in Pagan beliefs, as they may influence others by magical 
means. The study expands the notion of new spiritualities by showcasing a new spirituality with
intentional communalism-environmentalism, as well as explaining its coexistence with 
individualism."
The (Re)mediated Reading Experience,"['Ortiz Varela, Claudia']","['Baibarac-Duignan, Corelia']",2021-10-29T10:01:58Z,EN,"['printed book, digital reading device, coexistence, complementarity, Remediation Theory, Affordance Theory, COVID-19 pandemic.']",New Media and Digital Culture,"With the appearance of digital reading devices, speculations about the end of the printed book emerged (Ballatore & Natale, 2016). Previous studies have tried to address these concerns and approached this phenomenon as a debate between the old and the new version of the book (Martin & Quan-Haase, 2013; van der Velde & Ernst, 2009). This thesis, on the contrary, transcends the belief that digital reading devices will replace printed books. Instead, it focuses on studying the experiences academic users live with these devices by studying the coexistence and complementarity of printed books and digital reading devices. This one, although it had been accepted in previous literature, had not yet been researched. To do so, I addressed the academic segment during the COVID-19 pandemic, as previous literature shows that this global situation has increased the interest in digital reading (Adeyemi, 2020; Parikh et al., 2020). By performing a three-step research approach, this thesis aims to investigate the role of affordances in the reading experience of academic users. Firstly, a survey was distributed to obtain an overview of the current phenomenon and to invite participants to the subsequent step. Secondly, semi-structured interviews were carried out to investigate people’s interactions with the devices. Thirdly, the participants from the interviews were invited to a week of reading during which they documented and described in better detail their experiences with these formats. The obtained information was processed and analysed with affordances as a methodological framework. This research design allowed to study the meaning behind the affordances stated by the participants. It was concluded that academic users use printed books, digital reading devices and their affordances to complete their tasks or to enhance their reading experience. Evidence of affordances being simultaneously used was also found, contributing to a better understanding of the neglected phenomenon of coexistence and complementarity between these devices. This finding also uncovers nuances in the debate between printed books and digital reading devices. This thesis promotes a new angle from which future research can examine this phenomenon and research the coexistence of printed books and digital reading devices. To do so, it enhances Remediation Theory and proposes affordances as analytical tools. Additionally, through its methodological approach, this thesis proposes an enhanced data collection process that combines three methods to research the reading experience and investigate users’ opinions in a multi-faceted perspective."
An alternative rabbit hole?,"['Doesburg, Jannigje van']","['Hoofd, I.M.']",2021-10-29T10:02:02Z,EN,"['Echo chambers, alternative media, audience fragmentation, Telegram']",New Media and Digital Culture,"In 2020 the whole world changed radically over one year due to the coronavirus. This caused misinformation and conspiracy theories to spread, which mainstream social media platforms attempted to reduce by censoring certain information, profiles or groups. This was mainly due to the fear of the creation of so-called echo chambers. The activists started to migrate to the alternative social medium Telegram. Previous research has shown that alternative news and social media play a considerable role in the construction of such echo chambers on mainstream social media. This research has therefore attempted to answer the following question: to what extent and how do alternative news and social media contribute to the construction of echo chambers within the hybrid media ecology of coronavirus activism groups on Telegram? With the use of distant reading and close reading, this research analyzed five coronavirus activism groups on Telegram. The analysis showed that alternative social media and alternative news media play a different role in the construction of echo chambers. Alternative social media tended to contribute more within the large environment as it caused a space where only certain beliefs and ideas are shared and where discussion about topics was out of the ordinary. On the contrary, alternative news media caused many different platforms to be shared, causing the group members to be exposed to many different opinions and views."

Against this background, this thesis investigates how the game creates awareness of the pandemic response actions. This is done by establishing and executing a game analysis consisting of text, play experience and context. First, I analyse how the rules of the game create awareness of the actions by focusing on the concept of procedural rhetoric. Second, the game is played in the instrumental and explorative play modes, which demonstrates how ludopedagogical dissonance arises. Third, the findings of the previous two sections are explored in relation to the context of the game. I find that the game elements trigger players to focus on the vaccine and on winning the game. This focus results in ludopedaggoical dissonance, which is the disconnect between the serious intentions of the game, the knowledge allegedly gained through the game and the actual transferred knowledge."
Immunomodulatory properties of DNA binding chicken cathelicidins on murine macrophage TLR9 activation.,"['Bossche, Daan']","['Veldhuizen, Edwin']",2021-10-29T10:02:00Z,EN,[],Infection and Immunity,"Cathelicidins have long been researched for protective capabilities against invading pathogens. Recently, they have been connected to the modulation of nucleic acid sensing by TLR receptors. However, little is known about their immunomodulatory influence on DNA-activated macrophages. In this study, we looked into the effects of DNA-binding cathelicidins on murine macrophages activated using physiological DNA or synthetic ODN. Our results show that chicken cathelicidin (CATH)-2 has a different effector function based on the type of DNA used. For ODN, it can enhance the activation of murine macrophages while with physiological DNA an anti-inflammatory function is observed. In addition, dextrorotary - CATH-2 was found to have a consistent anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages activated by all sources of DNA. Furthermore, truncated CATH-2 peptides, as well as CATH-1 were found to not affect DNA activated macrophages. These observations indicate that for DNA-binding cathelicidin research, the same cathelicidin might regulate immune responses differ depending on the cellular environment and DNA isotype."

Although feminist groups in the U.S. have advocated for decades to obtain the legalization of abortion, birth control, and the contraceptive pill, as part of the Pro-choice struggles, this movement has not considered other oppressions besides those experienced by white women, therefore, a Reproductive Justice framework is fundamental. Women of color in detention face several oppressions that do not allow them to have choices, nor rights. 
Forced sterilization practices and medical abuses against different communities in the U.S. have been widely documented. Nevertheless, these practices continue to occur nowadays. Women of color in detention face multiple intersections of oppressions that drive them far from accessing justice, and the immigration detention system is responsible
for countless human rights violations and structural violence.
The main questions that I seek to provide an answer for with this research are: to what extent is women of color’s access to Reproductive Justice hindered by the structural violence embedded in the U.S. immigration detention system, allowing the continuation of forced sterilizations and other non-consensual abusive gynecological procedures, as for example, those occurred in Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC) nowadays? And what strategies of resistance have taken non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and women of color against these abuses?"
The Livestreaming Game: Understanding the encounter between Twitch streamers and digital games,"['Molen, Kas van der']","['Werning, S.']",2021-10-29T10:00:45Z,EN,[],"Media, Art and Performance studies","This thesis explores the relationship between livestreaming and videogames as a cultural form through a qualitative study of game livestreaming practices. Zooming in on the Amazon-owned livestreaming platform, Twitch, I present an approach to analyze this platform as a site to study players. Doing so characterizes the livestreaming ecosystem as crucial to the distribution, proliferation, and cultural form of videogames. On a microscale, livestreaming contributes to meaning-making for communities of players. On a macroscale, it reshapes business models through platformization, represented by the coevolution between game design and livestreaming practices. Studying players, in this context, has several meanings. It addresses both the streamer-player as the one controlling gameplay, as well as the audience members and supplementary players that engage with the gameplay of the stream. In the first part of this thesis, I address how livestreaming can concretely affect games as a cultural form, by providing a site to develop communities and to exchange knowledge in and about games. In the second part, I will delve deeper into the interaction between streamers and videogames, by developing a theory of streamability. I define streamability as a phenomenon that grants Twitch a central position in the distribution of media texts while simultaneously giving participatory users the crucial role as diversifiers of games as media texts. Analyzing which contexts, occasions, and affordances allow for the creation of content that is worthy of streaming, this second chapter develops a theory of what I call “streamable contexts.” Secondly, the study of the coevolution of game design and livestreaming practices will address what makes for “streamable game aesthetics.” My approach consists of a combination of the study of players on Twitch and a grounded theory of streamability for game livestreaming. This thesis displays how the livestreaming ecosystem fundamentally reshapes games as a cultural form, as an industry, and as a culture. This particular cultural form is one that gives streamers the agency to play with games and their audiences while creating long-lasting communities in the process."
Dirty Workers or Dirty Wh*res?: Examining the Cycle of Dirty Work Stigma and Structural Violence as It Affects Monrovia's Sex Workers,"['Balsamo, Sophia']","['Gould, Lauren']",2021-10-29T10:01:27Z,EN,"['Sex work, structural violence, dirty work, stigma, Liberia, post-conflict']",Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"This research seeks to examine the stigma against sex work in a post-conflict setting as an issue that lies at the intersection of gender and labor, and how that stigma contributes to the structural violence so many sex workers worldwide suffer. To this end, the case of Monrovia, Liberia was chosen for its rebuilding effort’s significant emphasis on gender equality as well as the prevalence of sex work as a profession among its population. The analytical frame of dirty work was selected to better break down the various components of sex work and public opposition to it, and how those components contribute to the marginalization and violence perpetuated against Monrovia’s sex workers. This frame also allows us to examine the tension between essential and non-essential labor that sex work operates within. Using secondary research and open-source document analysis collected from relevant political institutions, local NGOs, IGOs, religious organizations, Liberian news outlets, and online comments posted by Liberian citizens, this research examines how sex work is portrayed as physically, socially, and morally tainted in the public discourse. Ultimately, this research finds that through physical, social, and moral taint, sex work in Monrovia is portrayed as a threat to Liberia’s rebuilding process and future stability, as it is attributed as a cause of Monrovia’s other social ills and as a physical manifestation of patriarchal violence contradicting UNMIL’s overarching goal of gender equality. As a result, numerous institutions in Monrovia enact barriers that severely decrease the quality of life for sex workers while simultaneously exacerbating the very issues they claim to be solving. This raises questions into sex work’s role in a post-conflict recovery process and how its status as essential labor can be used to ensure the human rights of sex workers."
"Living in the past, it’s a new generation: “We are all Generation Z”","['Eijsker, Lindi']","['Vries, Imar de']",2021-10-29T10:01:22Z,EN,['vicarious nostalgia; technostalgia; social media; TikTok; Generation Z; popular culture'],New Media and Digital Culture,"As long as time machines haven’t been invented yet, we can only (re)live the past through feelings of nostalgia. Many have tried to understand how nostalgia plays a crucial part in our lives. However, many studies focus on nostalgia experienced by middle-aged individuals and the elderly only since nostalgia-proneness has been hypothesized to peak as individuals move into middle age and during the retirement years. The current study questions this assumption and stresses that it is necessary to include young nostalgics in research since we can observe Generation Z longing for objects and experiences outside their lived past on video-sharing app TikTok specifically. This yearning for an indirectly experienced past by Generation Z, referred to as vicarious nostalgia, forms the basis of this study. Through textual, semiotic analysis of three popular TikTok videos showcasing vicarious nostalgia and online semi-structured interviews with six respondents aged 18-24 with a passion for the past, this study examines how the technological and cultural affordances of TikTok play a role in showcasing vicarious nostalgia and how Generation Z gives meaning to their nostalgic tendencies. Findings indicate that TikTok videos with nostalgic content can function as screen memories, showcasing positive, often recreated footage of times passed. The short duration of this sweet representation of the past resembles a fleeting memory, triggering nostalgia and making Generation Z long for more, similar content. The algorithmic, short videos are easily spread and archived, fit the current zeitgeist, and result in a nostalgia boom. As Generation Z are in their formative years, they construct their self-identity and experience a community feeling on TikTok. Findings further indicate that leveling criticism against new media is not only a trait of older generations: just like parents’ nostalgia becomes their children’s nostalgia, Generation Z seems to have taken over their parents’ cultural pessimism. Although Generation Z longs for the past as they believe people used to live in the moment with fewer sensory stimuli, they put things into perspective: the present is both a curse and a blessing marked by the pressure yet possibilities of the internet and the Covid-19 pandemic which they go through together, armed with nostalgic content at their fingertips to resort to: “We are all Generation Z”."
"'Get Brexit Done' and The Fragile Peace: English Nationalism, the Identity Politics of Brexit and the Impact on Transitional Justice in Northern Ireland","['Digan, Cathal']","['Malcontent, Peter']",2021-10-29T10:01:27Z,EN,"['Identity Politics, Brexit, English Nationalism, Transitional Justice, Northern Ireland']",International Relations in Historical Perspective,"100 years on from the partition of the island of Ireland in 1921 and the ‘Irish Question’ is just
as contentious as ever. The Good Friday Agreement in 1998 put an end to violence that plagued the
British enclave of Northern Ireland, seemingly settling tensions by creating structures for parity of
recognition and cooperation. Yet, Brexit has brought these tensions back to the fore of British, and
even European politics. Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson, perhaps unwittingly, have pushed a project
that is threatening not just peace and security in Northern Ireland, but the structural integrity of the
United Kingdom as a whole, with nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales gaining increased
popularity. This series of events has led to more questions than answers.

This thesis aims to address the particular character of identity politics that has been
developing for decades in Britain, specifically ‘English Nationalism’. This trend, responsible for the
popularity of Farage and Johnson, can be seen as the manufacturer of Brexit. English Nationalism
has both directly and indirectly had adverse side effects on Northern Ireland’s system of transitional
justice between the Brexit vote in 2016 and the UK’s official withdrawal in January 2021. I will seek
to define the ways in which this happened by firstly defining English Nationalism in its complexities
and investigating how this has affected the Peace Process both through and beyond Brexit."

The vast scope and extent of this issue, combined with its grave impacts upon the wellbeing of both the missing and their loved ones, constitute a humanitarian crisis of the utmost urgency. Given that finding missing persons is a complex task that requires forensic expertise and significant resources, support from international stakeholders will certainly be necessary. Thus, this thesis applies the framework of ‘truth recovery’ put forth by Iosif Kovras to examine the role of international stakeholders in the search for Syria’s missing. To give a coherent and in-depth understanding of the obstacles and opportunities which stakeholders face as they select truth recovery efforts to fund and pursue, the political opportunity structures surrounding efforts to find the missing are assessed for each of Syria’s three major autonomous or semiautonomous zones. Then, given existing conditions and barriers to the recovery of truth, this thesis offers three general principles which international stakeholders should abide by as they engage in efforts to uncover the fate of the missing. Those are: (1) prioritize forensic truth in the short term over the naming, shaming, and punishment of perpetrators, (2) begin the process of forensic truth recovery immediately, and (3) respect the sensitivities of victims and families and include them in truth recovery efforts."
The Netherlands in Kosovo: The Dutch Media and their Influence on the Government,"['Grijzenhout, Simon']","['Pechlivanis, Paschalis']",2021-10-29T10:01:29Z,EN,['Kosovo; CNN-effect; media; Netherlands'],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"This research studies the relations between press and government in the Netherlands. This is examined on the basis of the war in Kosovo and the NATO-operation of bombing Yugoslavia in 1999. Leading up to this war, images were spread quickly, and this could have influenced the decisions made by governments to intervene. This research provides an understanding on how the media was of influence in the nineties, the era of real-time media. Afterwards, the context of this decade and the region is specified. The principle of humanitarian intervention emerged in the nineties and sparked a debate about sovereignty and the interaction between human rights and territorial integrity are explored. Furthermore, this decade meant the end of communism and the breakup of Yugoslavia. A complicated process with wars in which the
international community was already involved. The role of the Netherlands in Srebrenica is
especially examined.
In 1999, the Netherlands participated in the air-strikes of NATO against Milošević. To determine the possible influence of the media, three Dutch newspapers are looked into. The fluctuation in the number of articles is explored to establish the media attention per week. These peaks in attention are linked with actual events in Kosovo and connected to decisions made by the government in the Netherlands. The proportionality and tone of the articles is further examined to decide whether the newspapers challenged the official policy. This research finds three peaks in articles in these three newspapers. The newspapers mostly use an Albanian perspective and have an increasingly pro-interventionist tone.
The policies of the Dutch government, however, do not seem to change significantly after these three peaks. They can be accused once of making a hasty decision once, but overall other factors seem to have played a bigger role in decisions about Kosovo, like the involvement of bigger states. The legacy Srebrenica and the desire to restore its reputation could also have been a contributing factor. The political influence of the Netherlands was itself marginal in Kosovo. Therefore, this research finds more prove for that the Dutch government made wellinformed decisions that were led by others, than for a successful push from the media to intervene in Kosovo."

Max Mutschler, Jolle Demmers and Lauren Gould explain this transformation of warfare in their introduced concept of ‘liquid warfare’, which they describe as the moment in military interventions that the conventional ties between war, space and time have become undone. In an attempt to influence the existing debates on the ‘key moment’ from which on military interventions became more ‘liquid’, this research presents evidence for the appearance of ‘liquid warfare’ in the Gulf War (1990-1991) and the Kosovo War (1999). The central question of this research is to what extent ‘liquid warfare’ occurred in the pre-9/11 military interventions in the Gulf and Kosovo. To answer this question in a structured and organized matter, this research established a comprehensive definition of ‘liquid warfare’, which is used as an analytical tool throughout this research. ‘Liquid warfare’ is explained as a combination of (1) a form of military interventionism that has transformed from boots on the ground deployments towards light-footprint military interventions, which can also be described as the use of remote warfare techniques. (2) The vision that remote warfare techniques are used to shun the direct control of territory, focusing instead on the destruction of enemy forces and/or infrastructure, copying certain characteristics of guerrilla warfare, integrating risk-transfer strategies and avoiding order-building and order-maintaining responsibilities."
LGBTQ+ Content on TikTok and Everyday Activism,"['Sainsbury, Cara']","['Raessens, J.F.F.']",2021-10-29T10:01:25Z,EN,"['TikTok, LGBTQ+, everyday activism, queer theory, CDA']",New Media and Digital Culture,"Due to the recent stay at home orders surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, young social
media users have found a new creative, activistic and comedic outlet through the platform
TikTok. The content shared on TikTok are short videos, any of which have the opportunity to
become viral if it is shared with the right audiences. The virality is what makes TikTok unique
and drives its users to constantly produce content. Just like on other social media platforms,
many different minority groups have found their place and their people on TikTok where
they share information, produce relevant jokes and communicate with each other. The
LGBTQ+ community is among those groups and some content creators on the platform try to
use TikTok’s possible virality affordances to spread awareness, destigmatize LGBTQ+ people
and educate others on sensitive or unknown topics surrounding gender and/orsexuality.
This thesis aims to find how the video creators are motivated to share this type of LGBTQ+
content which could result in social impact, especially on a smaller scale known as everyday
activism. Therefore, the main research question is: how are LGBTQ+ TikTok creators
motivated to create everyday activism within their networked identity and beyond?
The theoretical basis for this thesis will come from three separate understandings.
First, how TikTok and its affordances are situated within the general understanding of social
media and the platform society. Second, the notion of everyday activism is explained. Third,
the concepts of online, narrative and networked identity will be discussed and how these
work together in this thesis. Methodologically, Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis is used
to first analyse the LGBTQ+, activistic, TikTok video content as well the affordances offered
by the platform for the textual analysis. Secondly, to interview LGBTQ+ TikTok content
creators for the discursive practice and third to combine these different analyses and come
to an understanding of how these kinds of videos are situated within the social practice.
It was found that sharing stories of everyday smaller struggles by LGBTQ+ as well as
bigger personal hardships and experiences of discrimination, in many different formats, did
create moments of everyday activism in those who viewed and commented on the TikTok
content. The TikTok users shared that posting those types of personal stories online and
receiving positive, as well as negative feedback in some cases, helped in keeping them
motivated to continue posting their LGBTQ+ life online."

In doing so, I am to try to understand the use of SNSs as a platform for identity construction because I want to know how users employ the site’s features to reaffirm their identity concerning a specific community in order to help my reader understand that the cultural practices that surround the creation of identity may differ from that in the offline world due to the ubiquitous nature of new media.

These disturbances slightly affect radio waves. Radio waves are important for (military) satellite communication. Radio waves distortions can result in, for example, positioning and navigation uncertainties. Short-term forecasts of potential disturbances in the Earth’s ionosphere are hence important for satellite communication.

In this thesis we explore the distortions of radio waves in the upper atmosphere (> 50 km) We use an idealised model for the Earth’s magnetic field with a spatially and time-varying electron density model. Electron density variations are induced by ionisations events (e.g. solar winds) and give rise to radio waves distortions through recombination (of charged and neutral species) and diffusion. We will demonstrate that measurement of electron density variations can be used for short-term forecasts. These forecasts provide an early warning system for possible distortions in satellite communication."

repertoire operas, departing from the observation that the discourse on Werktreue and the 
closely related concept of Regietheater is unproductive and emotionally charged. The main 
problem within the discourse is argued to be that it is based on the presumption of a linear 
opposition between the two concepts, which can be demonstrated to be artificial. Through 
the hermeneutical model of the three worlds of a text, Werktreue and Regietheater are 
understood as dealing primarily with either the world behind the text or in front of the text. 
A case study is then examined, Graham Vick’s 2018 staging of Mozart’s opera Die 
Zauberflöte at the Macerata Opera Festival, through which is demonstrated that the 
supposed opposition between Werktreue and Regietheater is indeed artificial. Then, 
counterarguments are provided to Werktreue’s most recurring claims, and a new direction 
of thinking is proposed. Based on the previously introduced hermeneutical model, which is 
argued to be a triad conform Chiel Kattenbelt’s definition, a new triad is devised of 
Werktreue, Regietheater, and Aufführungspraxis (the latter as a substitute for the world of 
the text in the original triad). The proposition resulting from this is to understand these 
concepts (and specifically Werktreue) as closely interrelated ideal types that don’t exist 
separately identifiable in reality, countering their oppositional presupposition and 
resulting in a more productive basis for discourse. The practice of staging repertoire 
operas, it is argued, takes place in the interplay of these three concepts."

Demisexuality is defined by Demisexuality.org as “a sexual orientation in which someone feels sexual attraction only to people with whom they have an emotional bond.” (Demisexuality Resource Center, n.d.) Since no articles dealing specifically with demisexuality can be found in the main academic repositories, it could be said that there is a lack of research on the discourses that construct the sexuality of people who identify with this category. Moreover, although the demisexual community seeks to dissociate itself from an image of sexual conservatism, an association is oftentimes traced between this sexual identity and the set of sexual expectations that is traditionally imposed upon women. Thus, drawing on a non-essentialist understanding of sexual identities/subjectivities and on a qualitative interpretive approach to knowledge production, I conducted in-depth semi-structured individual interviews with nine Brazilian women who identify as demisexuals in order to investigate how they discursively construct their (demi)sexualities. Based on these interviews, in the thesis I reflect upon the following questions: What role do gender and sexuality play in the lived experience of demisexuality? How do demisexual people construct meanings of gender and sexuality in their narratives about their demisexual identification?"

This exploration derived from the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown, and its huge impact on the sector of arts. Since theatres, cinemas, and cultural institutions remained closed, canceling and postponing scheduled events, some artists turned their focus on online platforms. Therefore, the starting point of this phenomenon of online theatre, during the time of the pandemic, is trying to discover how the social media platforms have the potential to produce online theatre, and how they can enable a sense of liveness in online performances. Thus, this thesis explores how theatre functions in moments of crisis, the role of social media in theatre-making in this context, and how this influences the experience of the spectator. The analysis is based on existing literature on concepts about liveness as Liveness: Performance in a Mediatized Culture (2008) by Philip Auslander, intermediality in theatre by Sarah Bay Chang, Chiel Kattenbelt, Andy Lavender, and Robin Nelson in their book Mapping Intermediality in Performance (2010), interwoven with more recent publications about theatre and social media, like Theatre, Social Media, and Meaning Making (2017) by Hadley Bree and Theatre and Social Media (2016) by Lonergan Patrick. I examine the social media use and the video-sharing platforms in the current Social Media Culture, in order to elaborate on their use in the creation of online performances. In this thesis, I offer a dramaturgical analysis of two case studies, that use the same broadcasting platform Zoom, Digital Silence by Building Conversation, and Enter Full Screen by Nowy Theatr directed by Wojtek Ziemilski. Through this analysis, I explore the dramaturgical strategies of this video-sharing platform in the creation of at-home performances and examine under which pattern can this kind of social media theatre operate."

This thesis asks: How do different dramaturgical approaches to staging school violence in theatre construct affect in spectatorship? I study the following three case studies, each which portrays school shootings in a different way: Bang Bang You’re Dead by William Mastrosimone, 5° of Separation by Peyton Smetana, and On The Exhale by Martin Zimmerman. Using a foundation from Elinor Fuchs “EF’s Visit to a Small Planet: Some Questions to Ask a Play” through Maaike Bleeker’s dramaturgical lens in “A Dramaturgical Mode of Looking,” I identify specific dramaturgical elements in each case study which work to construct spectatorship including: the perspective from which the narrative is told, the composition of the spoken text, and how the shooting itself is represented onstage. I explore how these dramaturgical choices engage in a transfer of affect, evoking emotional engagement and critical thinking in the spectator. Utilizing arguments from Silvan Tompkins and Gilles Deleuze in Claire Hemmings “Invoking Affect”, the analysis enters the debate on biological versus experience-informed affect, settling between philosophies in application to performance. Evidence from affect theory texts on art and performance such as Ernst Van Alphen’s “Affective Operations of Art and Literature” and Miriam Felton-Dansky’s Viral Performance inform my perspective as I investigate how affect can be both advantageous and problematic in theatre on school violence. Through this investigation, I assess how performances on school shootings demand emotional investment from the spectator, activating affective operations to place the spectator in a role which requires critical thinking, reflection, and empathy."
Holding Clouds is Futile / Attending performance from the Buddhist perspective of Bardo: an exercise for times of transition,"['Delft, Jesse van']","['Groot Nibbelink, Liesbeth']",2021-10-29T10:00:36Z,EN,"['theatre, dramaturgy, buddhism, spirituality']","Contemporary Theatre, Dance and Dramaturgy","In this thesis, two distinct fields of study and practice, namely Tibetan Buddhism and contemporary performance are coupled. This demonstrates how they can jointly answer the questions whether and how contemporary theatre may be a training ground to exercise (an alternative) way of being with (periods of) transition. Buddhism proves to be a useful perspective to answer these questions as it has a strong focus on impermanence as a study object as well as practices which can be done to prepare for periods of change and transition. The Tibetan term bardo, stems from the traditional compilation of texts called The Bardo Thödol Chenmo. It is used as a reference point to create a systematic lens to look at performances’ potentiality to induce experiences of transition and invite for a specific attitude towards them. Bardo is, traditionally understood as a liminal state between death and rebirth, but also conceived as any transitional period one can be in. To use bardo as a perspective on performance I divided the concept into two ‘expressions’ of its meaning: bardo-as-continuous-transition and bardo-as-an- intermediate-modality-of-existence. The perspective is based on the similarities I argue for in Chapter 1, between experiencing an immersive performance and practicing visualization meditation, a practice done in preparation for bardo. Attentiveness and a nongrasping attitude are added to the perspective, as these are, according to Buddhism, attitudes which one should have in a period of transition. Two case studies, Curve, by Schweigman& and Het Houten Huis and Continuum by Johannes Bellinkx, are analyzed in how they immerse their audience into a bardo experience and how they invite attentiveness and nongrasping. The outcomes of this analysis show ways in which performance has the possibility to be a place in which spectators can prepare themselves for future transitions."

Within the field of Dutch contemporary theatre there are only two productions that label themselves as horror: Mart van Berckel’s Continenten and Jakop Ahlbom Company’s Horror. These incredibly different performances form both the inspiration for and the backbone of Merit Vessies’ research into the way horror works and can work in the medium of theatre.
In “Illusionism, Monsters and Meta-Horror: Theatre as a Medium for the Horror Genre,” Vessies first delves into the discourse surrounding horror in film, exploring different definitions of the genre and its many subgenres, and touching upon the different rules, characters and tropes belonging to different subgenres, and the different psychological explanations for why one can enjoy a horror film. Although there are many ways in which to approach the horror genre on an academic level, examining the way it works in theatre seems to be a first.
With the knowledge gathered from the field of film studies, Vessies goes into theory on intermediality and intertextuality that can be used as tools to analyze the way the theory on horror film works in theatre performances, specifically in the work of Van Berckel and Ahlbom. The research focuses in on the different ways in which the horror genre is referenced, either through 1) literal references of existing works of horror fiction, 2) thematic references to certain tropes, characters and/or subgenres, 3) techniques used that could be seen as emulating techniques used in film.
Through analyzing Continenten and Horror by looking at the way the performances reference the horror genre, this text shows the broadness of horror as well as its versatility and the amount of possibilities that exist for horror, both in film, in theatre, and in academics."
The Broken Status-Quo: Securitizing COVID-19,"['Enden, Jeremy van den']","['Graaf, Beatrice de']",2021-10-29T10:01:31Z,EN,[],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"Since the turn of the century, the notion of security has increasingly been examined while consciously taking into account its subjective nature in contemporary politics. This thesis adopts a similarly inclusive concept of security that allows for integration of additional focal points throughout the analysis: that of public health and inequality. Through detailed analysis of the public statements, press conferences and (emergency) consecutive orders of two regional actors in the New York City regionㅡthe New York State Department of Health and the New York City Office of the Mayorㅡthis research examined how these actors securitized the Coronavirus-disease 2019 pandemic from January 1, 2020 until January 15, 2021 and how this was transformed into specific forms of action and mobilization. Consequently, this thesis defined seven consecutive phases of the securitization trajectory within this period. It concludes that the assessment of risk shifted towards an explicit security discourse from March, 2020 onward, in which the framework surpassed the realm of public health alone. This enabled these political actors to enact impactful social restrictions and halt nearly all public activity in the city and to prompt the city into action, scilicet to practice individual hygiene measures and to get tested. The examination paid specific attention to the extent to which these securitizing actors embedded the notion of inequality into their construction of security and concludes that gradually through the trajectory these actors adopted inequality as a lens through which underlying and pre-existing disparities could be addressed through the expansion of the referent subject, stirring a broad framework to move forward from the crisis as a city."

institutional actors, showcasing the hybridity and fluidity involved in such human-environment
interactions. This thesis will analyze the inter-institutional gaps found in Guyana's gold mining
sector in order to understand what conditions lead to these gaps and what the socio-ecological
consequences of these gaps are. This exploratory study seeks to conduct an institutional analysis
of Guyana’s gold mining sector by looking at the distinctions between formal and informal
institutional bodies and viewing how corrupt practices influences this extractive industry and
society at large. This study shows that even though corruption and mismanagement are integral
parts of Guyana’s gold mining sector, the consequences of such arrangements have mostly led to
latent conflicts and slow-paced environmental destruction, providing Guyana with a relative
amount of stability when it comes to national and international conflicts."

that members of the Ghanaian diaspora actively shape their transnational field, habitus, and

while simultaneously maintaining transnational ties with Ghana. In addition, this research finds
that the attitudes of members of the Ghanaian diaspora in the Netherlands towards
homosexuality have become more positive through the process of migration, which is in line

Where authoritarianism and democracy meet: Resistance and submission of members of the Hong Kong diaspora in the Netherlands to Chinese authoritarian repression and securitization,"['Vane, Esmeralda']","['Verbossen, Gijs']",2021-10-29T10:01:35Z,EN,['transnational repression; securitization; counter-securitization; politicization; resistance; submission; diaspora; authoritarianism; democracy; Hong Kong; the Netherlands; China'],Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"This thesis seeks to explore the reactions of members of a diaspora in a democratic state to transnational repression and securitization by an authoritarian state, with members of the Hong Kong diaspora in the Netherlands responding to Chinese authoritarian repression and securitization as a case study. This thesis argues that, through securitization, the Chinese Government implemented the Hong Kong national security law to secure Chinese sovereignty and security. With the introduction of this law, the Chinese Government expands its authoritarian influence into the territories of other states to control the Hong Kong diaspora, which becomes subject to transnational repression. Through interviewing and participant observation, this thesis examines how members of the Hong Kong diaspora in the Netherlands have responded to home-country repression and securitization. This thesis concludes that members of the Hong Kong diaspora (1) self-deprive their (democratic) freedoms and (2) resist authoritarian home-country repression and securitization through an intertwined process of politicization and counter-securitization. The former shows the urgency of the matter for democratic states to protect their residents against authoritarian influence. The latter contributes to academic literature, emphasizing the perspective of ‘diaspora resistance in a democratic host-country against home-country repression and securitization’. This thesis develops a framework in which resistance against home-country repression and securitization can be understood. This framework shows that Hong Kong diaspora members form a pressure group that, through counter-securitizing speech acts and politicization, makes the threat posed by the Chinese Government relevant for intermediary audiences to act upon."

The Interpretation of Mass Collectives by Dutch Adults: An analysis of native Dutch-speaking adults’ interpretations of mass collectives and the influence of contextual information.,"['Aalbers, Hannah']","['Meroni, Luisa']",2021-10-29T10:01:41Z,EN,['Mass collectives; count nouns; mass nouns; mass-count distinction; collectives'],Linguistics,"The aim of this study is to add to the existing body of research on mass collectives (collectives hereafter). These collectives, such as the English word furniture, are argued to have mass syntax, while semantically allowing a mass reading, an individual reading, or both. Recent studies show that collectives are individual-denoting in a wide range of typologically distinct languages such as English (Barner & Snedeker, 2005), Mandarin Chinese (Lin & Schaeffer, 2018), Hebrew (Hacohen, 2008), and Dutch (Van Witteloostuijn & Schaeffer, 2018). However, these conclusions are questioned by further research based on methodological issues. Huang and Meroni (to appear) suggest that the individual-denoting reading is the most accessible reading of collectives, but not the only possible one. Their research on collectives in Mandarin Chinese shows that manipulating the context and morpho-syntactic information allows participants to give both the individual-den oting and the substance-denoting reading. In the present study, using an online version of the Truth Value Judgment Task, I extend this line of research to a typologically different language, namely Dutch. I investigate if a substance-oriented context can elicit the substance-denoting reading of collectives in native Dutch speaking adults in the same way it does for Mandarin speaking adults and children (Huang & Meroni, to appear). Participants were asked to judge both collectives and count nouns in both substance- and individual-oriented contexts. Results indicate that the substance-oriented context did not elicit a substance-denoting reading of collectives; the difference between the interpretation of collectives in both contexts was not significant. Several potential explanations for these results are discussed as it could be possible that the online setting of the experiment and/or the collectives used for test items made the substance-denoting reading less accessible. Another e xplanation could be that the mass-count distinction is stronger or different in Mandarin Chinese because of the typological differences between Dutch and Mandarin Chinese. Further research on a language typologically similar to Dutch could shed more light on the results of this experiment."

On Practices and Experiences of ‘Modernity’ in the Everyday Lives of Female White-Collar Employees in the Weimar Republic","['Niesen, Louisa']","['Hung, J.B.']",2021-10-29T09:55:15Z,EN,['Women; White-Collar Employees; Modernity; Weimar Republic; Cultural History; Alltagsgeschichte; Experiences; Practices; Rationalization; Bureaucratization; Social Discipline'],Cultuurgeschiedenis van modern Europa,"My thesis examines practices and experiences of ‘modernity’ in the everyday lives of urban female white-collar employees in the Weimar Republic. While these women have been treated by their contemporaries as the quintessential ‘modern woman’, historical scholarship has long painted them as rather traditional. Many of the findings of both sides were based either on sociological literature or on representations, while the perspectives of these women themselves have been taken less into account. Drawing on ego-documents, such as a diary and essays of apprentices, my thesis aims at filling this gap. Using the approach of ‘Alltagsgeschichte’, it investigates female employees’ everyday lives under three aspects of modernity, as identified by Weimar scholar Detlev Peukert, Max Weber, and Michel Foucault: rationalisation, bureaucratisation, and social disciplining. The main body of the thesis consists of three chapters, each treating one of these characteristics. Every chapter is divided into a part that focuses on the work environment of female employees, and one that looks at life outside of work. Three interdependent conclusions can be drawn: first, in some areas of female employees’ everyday lives, modernity was clearly articulated, in others it was less evident. Female employees’ experience of modernity was thus characterised by strong tensions and contrasts. Second, within these tensions, female employees knew how to reconcile their own demands with the requirements and challenges of modernity. They shaped their own lives, thus exhibiting agency. Third, female employees were neither the quintessential ‘modern woman’ invoked by their contemporaries, nor the backward-looking, naïve women they appeared to be in some scholarly literature. Being modern and being traditional were not mutually exclusive. Female employees showed characteristics of both extremes, thus appearing as ambivalent figures. With its orientation towards Weber’s and Foucault’s diagnosis of modernity, this thesis is based on a rather constraining conception of modernity that leaves categories, such as ‘cultural modernity’, aside. An expanded conception of modernity would prove valuable as a further avenue of research in this field."
Trans* Matter Troubling and Disrupting from the In-Between: On Imagining Trans* as Radical Ontological Refusal,"['Vermeulen, Ier']","['Thiele, K.']",2021-10-29T10:00:42Z,EN,"['trans*, embodiment, ontology, gender, imagining']",Gender Studies (Research),"The body is not a neutral entity. Rather, it is always implicated in power structures and part of signifying processes; the body, like ‘text’ in the Derridean sense, is a sign. As such, the body produces meaning and is inscribed with meaning – it reads and writes. One way in which meanings are imposed on a body is through processes of gendering. The body, as visible corporeality, becomes the medium through which understandings of gender are mediated. Since, in the Western framework, gender is understood as reliant on binary conceptions (male and female) and supposed to ‘align’ with gender expressions (masculinity and femininity), the body as corporeal matter that is presupposed to be ‘expressive’ of dualist gender conceptions seems to pose a problem for trans* and gender non-conforming folx* in traversing gender as a binary structure. This thesis engages with questions of the body, materiality, and ontology which are all structured by the symbolic order that upholds gender within a binary cisheteronormative framework. Through problematizing the gender order as reliant on gender as a colonial construct, critically engaging with material-discursively produced binaries, and analyzing how corporeal matter is always relationally structured with/in the symbolic order, this thesis explores the possibility to introduce trans* as radical ontological refusal of gender as a binary system, and investigates how trans* could disrupt gender regimes both on the level of the symbolic and material. In concluding that trans* subjectivities are always already part of the hegemonic symbolic order, and that the desire to disrupt, refuse or ‘go outside’ this order affirms situating trans*ness within the structures of the symbolic, this thesis ultimately explores different entry points to enable potentialities for trans*ness’ be(com)ing. By re/orienting trans* as an ontological affirmation rather than a radical ontological refusal, this project aims to open up different ways of being and doing trans* within/through/of the world by imagining an in- between otherwise through embodied narratives and poetic interventions."
The Female Migrant narrative in Postcolonial Cinema,"['Deb, Malabi']","['Ponzanesi, Sandra']",2021-10-29T10:00:32Z,EN,"['Postcolonial Cinema, Female Migrant, Hybrid Identities, Third Space, Diasporic Filmmakers, Postcolonial Feminism']",GEMMA: Master degree in Women's and Gender studies,"This research attempts to uncover the gaps that lie between the dominant narratives in film and feminist scholarship through an intersectional approach in understanding of the female migrant identity in the 21st century. The main research question investigated in this thesis is How does Mira Nair explore female migrant narratives in her postcolonial films, the Namesake and Mississippi Masala. The migrant women narrative here is explored as a hybrid identity, especially pertinent in the articulation of postcolonial cinema of Nair.  
The thesis focuses on questions of gender, race, colonialism and the South Asian Diaspora particularly in Mira Nair's films The Namesake and Mississippi Masala which make visible the much longer history of colonialism and their interconnections with migrant identities.  The research question is grounded in the theories of Homi Bhabha’s Hybrid Identities and the Third Space (1990, 1994, 1996) and Chandra Talpade Mohanty’s Under Western Eyes” Revisited: Feminist Solidarity through Anticapitalist Struggles (2003). The theories allow the understanding of female migrant identities explored as hybrid identities in their “in-betweenness” (Third Space) within Nair’s postcolonial cinema. Though parallel research has been conducted in Subeshini Moodley's 2004 MA thesis using postcolonial feminisms through accented cinema, my own research diverges from her hypothesis using ‘migrant women’ as a category of analysis within postcolonial cinema. This thesis extends upon Moodley’s research by focusing on the specific category of migrant women within the broader group of Third World Women. The reason for this choice is to highlight the intersectional oppressions operating within the migrant subjectivities and how gender complicates the dynamic while crossing borders of nation, culture and race. 
While Postcolonial Theory and film both engage with the language of representation, postcolonial cinema connects histories of colonialism to present day racial politics and remains an apt framework to understand the narrative of female migrant identities. The research methodology chosen to investigate the central research question is Discourse Analysis (DA) through a case study of the two films within the framework of postcolonial cinema. The main findings of this thesis illustrate that Mira Nair through the cultural representation of migrant women in her postcolonial films is able to give a speaking voice to historically silenced figures. Thus, using a postcolonial analysis female migrant identities are represented as a central subject telling their own stories and how such hybrid identities in their interstitial spaces challenge essentialist notions of culture and identity. Finally, Nair's narratives of migrant women in her postcolonial films articulate new possibilities of seeing and understanding marginalized identities."

Through affect theory as defined by Sarah Ahmed, Arts-Based Engaged Ethnography as constructed by Suzanne Goopy and Anusha Kassan, and John A. Bateman’s Multimodal Critical Discourse, this thesis explores and deconstructs how affects arise through the surfacing of our embodied responses, how art and film moves its audiences to feel, our attunement to the rest of our communities, and the 'stickiness' of our bodies as subjects of the patriarchy. Challenging colonial and patriarchal conventions of research of Western universities, this thesis makes use of decolonial, feminist, and non-Western methods of producing emotional knowledge. Our wounds exist in a socialized context, based on shared histories and structures of power, and affective movement occurs between bodies, objects, and art situated i n these very contexts. As Ahmed writes, we all know our pain because it burns through us, and this pain is often represented within Western culture as a lonely thing (Ahmed 23-28). But in Indonesian society, the patriarchal subject does not burn alone. The patriarchy is so pervasive in our culture that it ‘leaks’ into our everyday lives, on all levels of our lives as social beings, and thus this thesis analyses how a film can demonstrate how artistic conventions and methods can become indications of the dangers of structural oppression."

Daarbij is ook van belang hoe het beeld wat de NPO van YouTube heeft, het platform imaginary, het gebruik ervan vormgeeft. De NPO verdeelt hun activiteiten op commerciële platformen in het concessiebeleidsplan voor de periode 2022-2026 op in de categorieën directe en indirecte conversie. Directe conversie moet de gebruiker rechtstreeks naar de eigen platforms leiden. Indirecte conversie ziet meer op het creëren van een band met het publiek op platforms van derden. Vanuit het concept platform imaginary van Karin van Es en Thomas Poell is er gekeken naar de interfaces van de drie YouTube-kanalen. Het concept platform imaginary refereert naar een handelswijze waarbij sociale actoren hun activiteiten met betrekking tot algoritmen, interfaces, data-infrastructuren, bedrijfsmodellen, gebruikerspraktijken en publiek proberen te begrijpen en te organiseren. Voor dit onderzoek is er vooral gekeken naar de drie punten interfaces, algoritmes en publiek. Dit is gedaan aan de hand van een discursieve interface analyse. Uit de analyse is een viertal strategieën omtrent directe en indirecte conversie naar voren gekomen. Naar aanleiding van de analyse kan gesteld worden dat de pogingen tot directe conversie complex zijn en een actieve houding van de gebruikers vragen, ondanks het feit dat gebruikers op YouTube door de jaren heen juist een passievere houding hebben aangenomen. De nadruk ligt vooral op indirecte conversie. Door het creëren van wat ik een NPO3-bubbel noem, heeft de NPO een poging gedaan om de gebruiker op het platform YouTube te isoleren van alle content die niet gelinkt is aan NPO3. Om deze bubbel te versterken, maken de kanalen ook nog gebruik van een herkenbaarheidsstrategie, waarbij NPO3 en NPO3TV dezelfde lay-out gebruiken voor hun thumbnails, om zo op te vallen tussen alle andere video’s. Het kanaal van Spuiten en Slikken wijkt af van de strategieën die NPO3 en NPO3TV hanteren en legt de nadruk vooral op het eigen kanaal, wat ten koste kan gaan van de NPO3-bubbel. Er is een splitsing te zien tussen de twee hoofdkanalen en de kanalen, zoals Spuiten en Slikken, die tot een specifiek programma toebehoren. Op basis van de drie punten uit het concept platform imaginary die aan bod kwamen in dit onderzoek, blijkt het dat de NPO een steeds beter beeld krijgt over welk publiek ze aanspreken en hoe ze aan de hand van de algoritmes van YouTube hun interfaces zo goed mogelijk naar hun hand kunnen zetten om gebruikers aan zich te binden. Echter, het onderzoek toont ook aan dat de transitie naar online platforms nog altijd bezig is en er nog wel degelijk progressie geboekt kan worden in de aankomende jaren."

The focus is on issues of cultural fluidity and otherness. These theories interpret music from a cultural and political perspective by narrating a relationship between historical conjuncture and cultural identity formation.
 
The study shows modern Greece’s main cultural components and how these were reflected in Tsitsanis's work. I set three case studies in the center of my analysis to shed light on his musical innovations and the composer’s extended inclusivity and originality. The chosen songs are Witch of Africa, Cloudy Sunday, and Zaíra, and each of them has important novelties that contributed to the popularization of rembétiko and its swift from a marginalized genre to the most mainstream music style of after-war Greece. Therefore, this paper answers the question: “How can we understand the construction of a modern Greek cultural identity through an investigation of Tsitsanis’s work?”. 
 
Tsitsanis’s work was a complex, periodical, and continuous route between Greece’s most pivotal musical and cultural components; a dialectical play between East, West, and new sub-genres. Within this route, theories of cultural identity building and identity’s fluidity find implementation in Tsitsanis's work and evolution."

has been a proactive proponent of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) while simultaneously
vehemently resisting legal accountability for corporate human rights violations. This thesis argues
that Shell’s seemingly contradictory positions on CSR and human rights can best be understood by
conceptualizing Shell’s CSR as strategic action that serves to protect the status quo in the Niger
delta against the external threat of enforceable legal obligations. Using Strategic Action Field
Theory as a tool for analysis, this thesis approaches the phenomenon of CSR through a critical,
post-colonial lens. It finds that because the field of oil extraction in the Niger delta emerged in
Nigeria’s colonial period, the power disparities that characterized the relations between European
multinationals and African communities continue to shape the rules, practices and understandings
that govern oil extraction in present day Nigeria. As a result, the key elements of the status quo of
oil in the Niger delta have remained surprisingly stable amidst the continuous crisis and political
turbulence that characterizes the Niger delta. Binding, enforceable human rights obligations could
however fundamentally change the status quo of oil extraction in the Niger delta. So far, Shell has
been able to forestall this development by presenting corporate social responsibility as an
alternative to corporate legal accountability in global policy making spaces. However, analysis of
two examples of Shell’s CSR in the Niger delta shows that Shell’s CSR by design only achieves
marginal changes: all core aspects of the status quo in the Niger delta are left intact. This finding

The transitional justice (TJ) framework of the United Nations aims to address these kinds of gross human rights violations. In recent TJ scholarship, the focus has been on the involvement of the affected community in the TJ strategy and its different mechanisms. Their participation would allow for a TJ process that responds to their interests. This thesis therefore researches the visions of justice of certain Yazidis. More specifically, it analyzes the perceptions of the Yazidis on the current TJ process and mechanisms and examines their wishes for the future TJ process.

To this end, I interviewed 20 Yazidis and four experts who have worked closely with Yazidis in Iraq. I asked the Yazidis questions about the current TJ process and how they would like to see this improved. I found that the Yazidis I interviewed have a broad conception of justice: justice for the genocide should inevitably entail prosecutions of the perpetrators of the genocide, but also focus on their current priorities and needs and include assurances that the genocide will not be committed again. These results suggest that the notion of justice contains punitive and social concerns and future-oriented elements for the Yazidis I interviewed. More research needs to be done, however, as this was an exploratory study."
Small wins triggering the sustainability transition of the Dutch construction industry,"['Reijnders, Bram']","['Wanzenböck, Iris']",2021-10-29T11:00:29Z,EN,['small wins; sustainability; construction; MLP; transitions'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The Dutch construction sector has to deal with two great social issues. First, the Dutch government is 
increasingly emphasizing the transition to a more sustainable industry, that focuses on circularity and 
reducing the environmental impact. Secondly, there is a housing shortage in the Netherlands. In order 
to accomplish both tasks, the Dutch government is pushing for more innovation in order to achieve a 
sustainability transition. To analyze whether a sustainability transition is occurring and innovations are 
initiated to accelerate the transition, this research used the multi-level perspective and the small wins 
approach. Small wins are completed, concrete, implemented outcomes of moderate importance, and 
focus on incremental change to achieve sustainable results for large societal challenges. The research 
aims to systematically analyze innovative initiatives of small-scale, which are qualified as small wins, 
in the sustainability transition issue of the Dutch construction industry, by answering the following 
research question:  

How can “small wins” amplify the sustainability transition of the Dutch construction industry? 

To formulate an answer on this questions, a qualitative research design was used. Sixteen initiatives 
were studied that contributed to the sustainability transition as derived from desk research. The 
conducted interviews were coded using the constant comparative method in order to compare 
categories and identify patterns. 

The analysis showed that moderate importance is experienced as valuable for small wins to achieve 
more radical change and transformations. Small wins should have concrete outcomes to eventually 
become positively judged by others, which stimulates the development of the small win. The market 
barriers small wins experience are causing technical and regulatory barriers small wins have to 
overcome. The risk averse nature of the construction industry is hampering the further development 
of the small wins. In addition, small wins should couple their initiatives to other problem areas in order 
to increase the energizing and logic of attraction mechanism. As a result, more imitation and 
competition could occur, which would amplify the sustainability transition.  

Based on these results, it can be concluded that small wins should operate on a local and small scale, 
to develop radical innovations. By doing so, small wins will experience less resistance from the market. 
By being competitive on price and by complying with dominant standards and certification procedures, 
small wins can overcome existing barriers. The assumption is that when the right propelling 
mechanisms are activated, small wins can amplify the sustainability transition in the Dutch 
construction industry."

Often, the only way to reduce the costs of creating these objects is by using copies of the same object multiple times throughout the world. We propose an approach towards developing a system that may generate a large number of varying human-made objects automatically. We created such a system following our approach to automatically generate Gothic window traceries, and tested the quality and variety of our generated windows via two objective tests. We succeeded in creating a system that generates tracery designs that are indistinguishable from real Gothic designs, and the output of our generator is objectively percieved as more variable than copies of previously seen pictures."

deadliest migratory route. Not only do many migrants and refugees pass away through their
efforts to reach EU shores, but also with regards to their hosting in the North African
countries many dangers await their fate. These dangers include arbitrary detention and
inhumane conditions in detention centres in Tunisia, and possible violence, starvation, torture,
rape and even slavery in Libya. Evidently, the refugee and migrant populations in both
countries have a lack of protection and rights. Thus, in this thesis, it will be investigated how
the development of migration and asylum policy in both countries after the Arab Spring can
be explained. Through historical and causal narrative, it will be demonstrated that migration
and asylum policy within both countries has followed a path-dependent trajectory. Whereas
the Arab Spring and subsequent political transition in both countries could have pushed the
countries to establish a new form of migration management. It will be demonstrated that due
to political polarization the practice of the dictatorial regimes in which migration was used as
a diplomatic tool was reinforced. Through the analysis of migration and asylum policy both
before and after the Arab Spring the study aims at filling the historiographic gap with regards
to migration and asylum policy, as well as offer an explanation for the neglect of refugees and

been studied, among which many of the factors that influence this process, such as gender and
wealth. However, there is not as much research and insight into how this process functions
online, and most of the research that has been conducted focused on quantitatively measurable
social status, for example through analysis of ‘likes’, ‘followers’, and ‘views’ (Lampe et al.,
2007; Levina & Arriaga, 2014). In order to contribute to this gap in knowledge, this study
analyzed the platform Discord using a critical discourse analysis. First the platform was
analyzed using the discursive interface analysis, after which its social media accounts and
website were analyzed. This was followed by the conduction of interviews and surveys, and
lastly a social practice analysis was performed. Using the results of these analyses the
following research question was answered in this thesis: How does the platform Discord
contribute to the creation of social status online? One of the main results was a framework of
indicators that contribute to online social status assignment. Of these indicators, interests and
availability were found to be the most important contributors to social status assignment on
Discord, and gender and education were found to be the least important contributors. Discord
was found to mainly influence the process of social status assignment through their emphasis
on the creation of communities and the use of roles within a server that they have
implemented."
The Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation over the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex on Anhedonia Symptoms in Treatment-Resistant Major Depressive Disorder,"['Visser, Emma']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2021-10-29T11:00:28Z,EN,['Major Depressive Disorder; Anhedonia; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Prefrontal Cortex; Treatment resistance'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Anhedonia is one of the core features of major depressive disorder, but treatment has proven to be difficult. Effects of antidepressants on symptoms of anhedonia may be related to their ability to alter dopamine neurotransmitter reward-systems. This warrants research to search for therapies that can specifically target these neuronal pathways. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has this ability and might therefore be a promising therapy for anhedonia. The current study examines the effects of rTMS over the left DLPFC on anhedonia symptoms in a series of patients with moderate to severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant depression. This randomized controlled trial involved an intervention of 8 weeks of rTMS treatment and subsequent follow-up six months later. The severity of depression and anhedonia symptoms (measured with the HDRS-17 and SHAPS respectively) were assessed at baseline, after the treatment and at the six-month follow-up. Primary results were analyzed using a linear mixed model, with SHAPS scores as the dependent variable. Secondary outcomes include calculations of response and recovery rates regarding anhedonia symptoms after treatment. The analysis revealed a significant main effect of treatment group and time on the SHAPS-scores, with a significant decrease in SHAPS scores after 8 weeks of treatment rTMS treatment. The effects were long-lasting as the same results were seen at the 6
month follow-up. 45% of patients showed a considerable decline in anhedonia (>50%) after rTMS treatment, and 27% even reached full recovery. This study, therefore, indicates that rTMS could be an effective treatment for reducing anhedonia symptoms in MDD, but more extensive research is needed before it can be used in clinical practice."

2017 to 2018 and 2019 to improve the current Antimicrobial Stewardship Program (ASP)
at the Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals (CSCA) at Utrecht
University. Antimicrobial usage was quantified by calculating the defined daily doses per
animal (DDDA). The DDDA was 3.77 in 2018 and 3.08 in 2019. Compared to 2013-2017,
the DDDA had decreased significantly. In both 2018 and 2019, the majority of prescribed
antimicrobials were classified as second-line drugs. Penicillins were the antimicrobial
group most prescribed and the most prescribed active substance in both 2018 and 2019 was
amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Out of all sub-departments at the CSCA, antimicrobials were
used most at the Intensive Care Unit. In 2018, 509 out of 1206 bacterial culture samples
submitted for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, tested as multi-drug-resistant (MDR). In
2019 this number was 422 out of 1082. The General Surgery division submitted the most
samples in 2018 and 2019. To improve the ASP at the CSCA, antimicrobial usage and
antimicrobial resistance data should be monitored and evaluated on a regular basis.
Employees should be reminded of the importance of Antimicrobial Stewardship and
prescribe antimicrobials carefully. In addition, more bacterial culture samples should be
submitted to test antimicrobial resistance."

Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) is found to be the predominant compound in the harbour porpoise and in other marine apex predators globally. Studies in the North Sea suggest that PFOS remains stable in the food web or might even be decreasing in the last few years after regulations have been taken to limit the release and use of PFOS. However, long-chain Perfluoroalkyl carboxylates seem to be increasing in the harbour porpoise and other marine apex predators globally. The most important pathway that leads to contamination of PFAs into the North Sea are rivers that flow through urban, highly industrial and agricultural areas. The harbour porpoise feeds at a lower trophic level than other marine mammals in the North Sea but due to them being coastal foragers they might be more susceptible. Contamination is solely through their diet but there is a knowledge gap on trophic transfer in the harbour porpoise food web in the North Sea. New born porpoises and juveniles are the most contaminated of all life-stages, probably due to placental transfer and exposure through lactation. This makes the harbour porpoise particularly vulnerable, in laboratory animals is seen that exposure to high levels of PFOS results in developmental problems and reproductive failure. Recommendations on future research are given."
Revenge Feminism: Tracing Global Punitive Demands in Spanish Gender Violence Legislation,"['Rosario, Adrianna']","['Waaldijk, Berteke']",2021-10-29T10:00:33Z,EN,['gender violence; (anti) carceral feminism; abolition; neoliberalism'],GEMMA: Master degree in Women's and Gender studies,"This project traces global punitive discourses in Spanish gender violence legislation by focusing particularly on the dialectic between the law and feminist political mobilizations. It examines the rise of institutional feminism in Spain and how its embrace of neoliberal social governance culminated in very punitively focused gender violence legislation. The project compares the carceral logics and tactics embedded in the Organic Law 1/2004 for Comprehensive Measures Against Gender Violence (BOE n 313, December 29, 2004; hereafter: Law 1/2004) and the more recently proposed Organic Law for the Comprehensive Guarantee of Sexual Freedom (hereafter: The “Yes Means Yes” Law). Law 1/2004 and The Yes Means Yes Law do not illustrate all the feminist contestations around punitive tactics in the last two decades, yet they act as productive case studies given that each are cornerstone pieces of legislation that set national guidelines for preventing, accessing and intervening in gender violence and happened to dramatically expand the penal code. Using a mixed-modal methodology of legal, feminist critical discourse analysis (CDA) with a genealogical approach, this project locates the converging and diverging globalizing carceral discourses in the laws. It features anti-carceral feminist resistances, in the form of organizing artefacts, to trouble the commonsensical claim that punishment is the most “just” and effective way to resolve gender violence. Transnational feminist criminologists, queer/trans scholars, and feminists of color further contextualize how globalizing carceral logics and carceral feminisms, embedded in gendered and racialized structures of power, travel and influence legal discourses and gender violence political strategies. This project contributes to other ways of reconciling gender violence that keep survivors and their communities safer and do not perpetuate violence against queer/trans and racialized bodies."
To be secured or securitized?

which has caused a rise in the intense political debate on the position of Muslims in the French 
society. Using the theoretical lens of securitization, this research analyses in what matter the French 
government is using a speech-act to justify extraordinary policy measures against the Islamic 
community in France, and how two sorts of non-state actors (Islamic organizations and human 
rights organizations) are contesting these developments. While there has been considerable 
attention in the academic world for the usage of securitization theory in investigating religious
minorities in European democracies, the dynamics within and between processes of 
(de)securitization involving different actors have been mostly neglected. By using Benford & 
Snow’s analytical framework of framing processes of social movements the pillars of securitization 
theory are operationalized and it is investigated via document analysis how the core framing tasks 
of diagnostic and prognostic framing are executed by actors in the dynamic playing field of 
emergency politics. This research shows that the French government is increasingly using a speechact to persuade the French population to accept new laws that grant the government more 
possibilities to control the population and to limit the public expression of religion. While these 
laws are not explicitly aimed at the Muslim minority in France, the two investigated non-state actors
believe that the French Muslim community are unjustly and disproportionally targeted by these 
new laws and as a result contest these law-making processes. However, the field of actors criticizing 
the politics of the French government proves to be too ideologically and logistically scattered to 
form a relevant and powerful voice against the French government. Concluding, this research 
shows that actors involved in processes of (de)securitization are active agents in an ever-evolving 
dynamic field of security, where processes of securitization and desecuritization are intermingled. 
Further research should focus on how the referent subject in a process of securitization can be part 
of the audience and has its own agency, how the institutionalization of securitization becomes 
increasingly relevant, how (social) media plays a role as provider of core framing tasks and how 
actors who oppose a securitizing act can start one themselves."

Rubens dient hierbij als voorbeeld voor hoe hoge kunst ingezet kan worden bij de constructie van een identiteit. Dit wordt gedaan aan de hand een discours analyse van tentoonstellingscatalogi van Antwerpse musea. In de studie naar nationalisme is sinds de negentiende eeuw veel veranderd. Hedendaags nationalisme is heel anders dan negentiende-eeuws nationalisme. In een geglobaliseerde wereld is de natiestaat niet meer vanzelfsprekend het eindproduct van nationalisme. In België is sinds 1830 een Vlaamse natie ontstaan. De Vlaamse natie richtte zich eerst alleen op taalpolitiek. Nu is België opgedeeld in een federaal systeem en heeft Vlaanderen een eigen overheid. In Antwerpse musea worden nog vaak tentoonstellingen over Rubens en zijn tijd gemaakt. In de jaren 80 is er nog niet veel nadruk op identiteit, er wordt voornamelijk ingegaan op Rubens kwaliteiten als kunstenaar. Er komt meer nadruk op identiteit te liggen. Dit is vooral een nadruk op lokale identiteit. Rubens wordt steeds meer vereenzelvigd met de stad Antwerpen. De opbloei van de stad liep grotendeels samen met de carrière van Rubens. Hij werd de belangrijkste schilder van de contrareformatie en voorzag de Antwerpse kerken na de Beeldenstorm weer van schilderijen. Zijn succes wordt gelijk gesteld met het succes van de stad. Dit onderzoek kan geen brede uitspraken doen over Vlaams nationalisme. In België wordt door historici veel onderzoek gedaan naar Vlaams nationalisme. Hopelijk kan dit onderzoek dienen als een voorbeeld voor hoe hoge kunst gebruikt kan worden om een lokale of nationale identiteit kan construeren."
Challenging established education: student perceptions of anti-oppressive components in the Dutch high school context,"['Feltmann, Sarah']","['Quinan, Christine']",2021-10-29T10:01:17Z,EN,[],Gender Studies,"For a long time now, there has been a worry about youth’s lack of political participation.
Arguably, this has to do with a general emphasis within education on the banking system of
education and little attention for the social sciences (in The Netherlands: Maatschappijleer
class). I argue that we need empathy to increase the degree of political participation. To teach
empathy, we need anti-oppressive education. This thesis explores the perceptions of five
former high school students on the presence of anti-oppressive components, such as
antiracism, in the high school curriculum and the school environment. Furthermore, it will
address the students’ opinions on the value, challenges and requirements of an elaborate
implementation of anti-oppressive education in the Dutch high school context. Through
critically approaching the students’ thoughts and opinions from a feminist point of view, the
article argues that anti-oppressive components are currently lacking in the Dutch high school
system and would, indeed, be a valuable addition in aiming for a more inclusive society in
which our students learn early on to take a stand against injustice."
Changing one's beliefs?

How ideology is touched upon in these programs is examined through three confusions that exist within deradicalization research, introduced by Koehler. The first confusion is about the meaning of ideology, often swapping it with concepts such as ‘worldview,’ ‘system of beliefs,’ or equal it to ‘theology.’ The second confusion is about false positives and negatives regarding ideology, meaning that ‘being ideological’ is often equal to ‘being ideologically or theologically literate.’ The third confusion is about multiple intertwined concepts and terms that are entirely unintelligible without ideology, such as ‘grievances,’ ‘black and white thinking,’ and ‘collective norms.’ Two programs initiated by the NCTV have been analyzed through these confusions by applying textual analysis: team TER and Forsa. Furthermore, counterterrorism strategies published by the NCTV have been studied in the same manner.
The findings show that Koehler’s three confusions are least applicable to the 2011-2015 counterterrorism strategy, as ideology is given much credit and its functions are acknowledged. The confusions apply to most parts of the counterterrorism strategy from 2015-2020 and on team TER and Forsa’s descriptions and evaluations, as ideology is much less mentioned and not explained in-depth, as other factors are seen as sometimes more important within deradicalization. The findings thus show a pattern of deterioration over time when it comes to ideology within Dutch deradicalization policy and of the knowledge of Salafi jihadi narratives that could help to understand and counter that ideology."

critical discourse analysis to assess two categories of the open data platform in order to better
understand the types of datasets that come into each. The analysis suggests that the placement
of datasets under specific categories, reveals socio-political discourses of ongoing coloniality
that promote inequality and embellish power relations. The findings indicate that the open
data platform is now working against the government's goal of increasing trust and
transparency among Colombian citizens. Future ethnographic study will create new
conversations to better understand this, keeping in mind that each Indigenous group evolves

In these adventures, they encounter various damsels. This thesis researches what (system of) norms for the behavior of knights toward damsels and vice versa can be distilled from this section, within the context of the Lancelot Compilation. In this thesis I have looked at two major themes: the theme of sexuality, courting and consent, and the theme of obligation and duty. 
I have found the presented norms in the section to be offered with room for debate. In Mordred’s passage, his cruelty is demonstrated by bad sexual behavior, but he likewise encounters damsels and knights behaving badly. Agravein’s adventures are featured least, for he encounters the fewest damsels. Gurrees’ section is very extensive, and it features a lot of contact between Gurrees and damsels. In this section, Gurrees starts out as a courtly lover, but, perhaps due to sexual frustration, increasingly results to using force and violence. The three sequential episodes of courting scenes that Gurrees encounters, leave room for discussion and disagreement between listeners.

The last knight, Gariet, does encounter many damsels, but he does not engage with them romantically. He is more concerned with his duty and the obligations he has towards damsels. I have contrasted his decisions therein (especially his decision to save a fellow knight, resulting in a damsel’s death), with decisions made by his brother Walewein in a previous part of the Lanceloet. Here also, there is room for disagreement and discussion about norms between listeners."

Aim of this research is to determine different variables and processes that led to different preservation states. Determining variables and processes that led to different preservation states of drowned landscapes will also lead to a further thorough understanding on different preservation states.  

A suite of methodologies has been used including literature study, new data collecting fieldwork and a data analysis at a series of scales. The use of these methodologies led to the understanding that erosion depth, distance to shore and depth of drowned landscape are the main drivers for preservation states of drowned Medieval landscapes. Comparison of this correlation with other sub-case studies verified the relation between these three variables. A first try in quantification led to the distance of roughly 1.2 to 2.2 kilometres in which preservation of Medieval landscapes decreases over distance until it is fully diminished."
In the Shadow of the Corporate State,"['Verdel, Rachelle']","['Wiegink, Nikkie']",2021-10-29T11:01:18Z,EN,[],Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"The ‘corporate’ is an increasingly powerful sovereign power, as is the case with the aviation sector in the Netherlands. Politics has become subordinate to the conditions of the economy of the aviation sector. The Dutch government - which owns 70 per cent of Schiphol - provides the aviation sector with an exceptional position with exclusions in the form of lower noise and environmental standards (nitrogen, ultra-particulate and CO2 emissions), the absence of tax levies and the exclusion of the aviation sector from the Paris Climate Agreement. By entrenching the power of Schiphol, the current industrial progress, which is responsible for the loss of biodiversity, the climate crisis and the deterioration of the living environment for residents, seems to be further reinforced. Through an ethnographic exploration of the actions of the opposition groups fighting against Schiphol's growth, I argue that this new political assemblage, also referred to as the corporate state (Kapferer, 2010), has profound implications for its citizens. This includes the rise of a new form of citizenship that I refer to as counter- citizenship, which represents the emergence of a formed group of citizens as a counter-power that challenges the givens of the corporate state by exerting external pressure and playing a significant role in setting the agenda, controlling and sanctioning powerful actors."
Greek Cinema Goes Abroad: The Progression of a Weird New Wave,"['Eikelbeck, Luca']","['Valck, Marijke de']",2021-10-29T11:01:26Z,EN,['Greek Cinema; Greek New Wave; Rick Altman; Semantic and syntactic analysis; Yorgos Lanthimos'],Film- en Televisiewetenschap,"The Greek financial crisis of 2008 drastically affected the budget of the cultural sector in Greece. This meant that filmmakers needed to find alternative ways to fund their projects. The difficult financial situation sowed the seeds of a new wave of Greek cinema often referred to as the Greek Weird Wave. An important filmmaker, who is often considered one of the founders of this wave is Yorgos Lanthimos. He produced two Greek films before moving his productions to the United Kingdom where he made two more films. Lanthimos’ departure to the United Kingdom is argued to be the end of the Greek Weird Wave. I argue that this is a simplification and argues that Lanthimos still made Greek Weird Wave films after moving his productions abroad. To prove this, I have conducted an analysis of Lanthimos’ work using Rick Altman’s semantic and syntactic approach to genre analysis, which has been reconstructed to fit an analysis of a cinematic wave. A semantic approach was used to analyze thematic and aesthetic similarities Lanthimos’ films carry. My results show that absurdism and the family- element, as well as sexuality and what I propose to call a “God-complex”, are important themes in Lanthimos’ films. My analysis also shows that the settings of the films play an insignificant role. Additionally, a syntactic analysis was conducted based on the theory on art cinema conventions, provided by Rosalind Galt and Karl Schoonover, and Pierre Bourdieu’s model of the literary field. My results show a shift in Lanthimos’ work from more experimental films to more mainstream films. In Lanthimos’ later productions, he accepts the influence of mainstream Hollywood standards. I would argue that the “Greek” in Greek Weird Wave refers more to a cinematic style than a geographical location and that Lanthimos has carried this style onto his international co-productions. Therefore, I would argue that the Greek Weird Wave did not come to a stop when Lanthimos moved his productions abroad. "
Combining Agent-Based Models with Virtual Reality to collect micro-level behavioural data in a smoke evacuation situation,"['Warmerdam, Myran']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2021-10-29T11:01:22Z,EN,[],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"The main research objective of this thesis was to fill the gap in micro-level behavioural data, that is missing to improve agent-based models. Furthermore, it aimed to enhance an evacuation model with a dynamic smoke environment. The dynamic smoke model was implemented to a static evacuation model, and the behaviour of the agents was adapted. New variables were introduced to the agents, so that they could perceive risk and cope with these risks. The micro-level behaviour data was collected by performing experiments in Virtual Reality. The experiments focussed on three elements: general behaviour when encountering smoke, smoke density and the location of the smoke. In the experiments, a mixed 5x2 design was used. Each participant went through five VR simulations, which were built in Unity3D, with either a low density or a high density. By conducting experiments with the evacuation model, the results of the VR experiments were compared to the model. Results were similar on average, however, differences in the environments made it difficult to compare. Future research should be focussed on a more realistic smoke model, a more realistic VR environment that matches the evacuation model better and a larger sample size in the experiments."
Two sides of a company.

To help illuminate this part of history, this thesis focuses on the role of the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) in their understudied south-African possession: The Cape Colony. It will be compared how the two operations of slave trade and settlement management that the VOC was involved in developed differently. To argue how the VOC could neglect settlement management while it developed its slave trading practices, the causal narrative method will be used. With this method, a holistic, picture will be created. It will be argued that the hierarchy, rules, and discipline of the VOC were dominated by a business operation in which the profit motive prevailed. That profit motive created the need to optimize the processes of the slave trade. This succeeded because these processes were subject to institutional layering. The Cape Colony did not fit the profit motive, creating a poorly managed and poorly controllable settlement. Here, the elite ruled, converting the ambiguous legal foundation to a legal system designed for their own gain. As a result, the settlement could not develop further. These were the two faces of the VOC: a company that was successful at innovating trading practices, but which neglected its settlements because they were not part of their main interests."
Deforestation and forest fragmentation in Southwestern Ethiopia from 1973 to 2019,"['Oostdijk, Saskia']","['Dorresteijn, Ine']",2021-10-29T11:01:20Z,EN,['Deforestation; forest fragmentation; landscape connectivity; Afromontane mountains; biosphere reserve'],Sustainable Development,"As biodiversity and biodiversity hotspots worldwide are threatened by the effects of land use, such as habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, it is important to understand the ongoing processes and their effect on the environment. It is especially important to gain a better understanding of deforestation and forest fragmentation patterns in biodiversity hotspots, such as the Afromontane mountains in Southwestern Ethiopia, and how this might impact large mammals. This research aimed to identify deforestation and forest fragmentation in Southwestern Ethiopia from 1973-2019 and what recommendations can be given in the context of large mammal conservation. This was done creating  forest cover maps and analysing those for deforestation and forest fragmentation patterns. Results showed that forest cover has been decreasing from 1973 to 2019, but during the last decade (2010-2019), the forest cover seemed to increase again. Deforestation was found mainly along the forest edges and among smaller forest patches between agricultural fields. Only the core area index showed to have a significant decreasing trend, indicating that the forest interior is decreasing. After the establishment of the Yayu Biosphere Reserve, forest cover increased and the core area remained similar. Reforestation was found at the forest edges while deforestation occurred mainly among the small forest patches. It is important to improve landscape connectivity and to halt deforestation as there is no certainty that recent reforestation efforts will have an immediate positive effect on biodiversity. This can be done by the implementation of land sharing and sparing zones in the area and the reconnection of forest patches by reforesting disconnected or nearly disconnected large forest patches. Moreover, an effort needs to be made to protect the small forest patches in the agricultural landscape as these patches are important for landscape connectivity and ecosystem services. This research identified patterns of deforestation and forest fragmentation from the 1970s to the present in the Afromontane mountains in Ethiopia, one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. Moreover, it adds to the empirical evidence to the contribution of biosphere reserves in the contribution to nature conservation. In addition, the scripts that were created in this study could be reused for similar research in the future, reducing the time needed to create forest cover maps and their analysis."
Evaluation of the Eveal program among the participants,"['Pardoel, Fleur']","['Jorritsma, Ruurd']",2021-10-29T11:01:20Z,EN,['Eveal;COMB;survey;veal'],Gezondheidszorg landbouwhuisdieren en vet. volksgezondheid,"Eveal is een online trainingsprogramma ontworpen door de dierenartsen van dierenartsen-praktijk Thewi, Universiteit Utrecht en de Nederlandse Land- en Tuinbouworganisatie (LTO). Het online leerprogramma streeft naar het verbeteren van ziektepreventie- en herkenning onder kalverhouders. De makers van het programma zouden graag willen weten of het leerprogramma verandering in het gedrag van de kalverhouders teweegbrengt op het gebied van vroege ziekte herkenning, eerder ingrijpen wanneer er iets mis is, meer preventieve maatregelen en verminderd gebruik van antibiotica op het bedrijf.
In dit onderzoek is het Eveal programma geëvalueerd door middel van een enquête. De enquête is via email verstuurd naar alle deelnemers van het Eveal programma, zowel naar de kalverhouders als adviseurs en andere in de kalverindustrie betrokken personen. We hebben 35 ingevulde enquêtes teruggekregen met een responspercentage van 20,6%. De enquête bestond met name uit vragen met een 7-puntse Likert schaal waarmee in totaal 7 verschillende gedragsveranderingen werden gemeten. Uit de resultaten bleek dat bij 3 van deze gedragsveranderingen het gemiddelde boven het middelpunt van de schaal lag en wij een mogelijke gedragsverandering hebben gevonden. Gedragsverandering werd waargenomen bij ‘verandering in houding tegenover preventieve maatregelen’ met een gemiddelde van 4,8 (SD van 1,2). Ook zien we dat de participanten sneller ingrijpen wanneer er iets mis is met de kalveren aangezien ‘Sneller ingrijpen’ een gemiddelde heeft van 4,6 (SD van 1,0). Als laatste zien we dat ‘Op een andere manier naar de dieren kijken’ een gemiddelde score van 4,8 (SD van 1,2) had waardoor wij concluderen dat het volgen van de Eveal modules ervoor zorgt dat de participanten op een andere manier naar de kalveren kijken.
Naast de meting gedragsveranderingen hebben we ook het theoretische COM-B model gebruikt om te kijken of we hiermee de gedragsveranderingen kunnen verklaren en voorspellen. Hiervoor hebben we met behulp van vragen met 7-puntse Likert schaal de ‘capability’, ‘opportunity’ en ‘motivation’ van de respondenten gemeten. Deze 3 componenten werden gebruikt als onafhankelijke variabelen in lineaire regressies waarbij de 7 gedragsveranderingen werden gebruikt als afhankelijke variabelen. We vonden dat de respondenten bereid zijn om ‘Meer discussies’ te voeren met dierenartsen of adviseurs wanneer hun ‘capability’, ‘opportunity’ en ‘motivation’ verhoogd (F (4,22) = 5,91, p = 0,02). Alle andere associaties waren niet significant.
Als laatste hebben we de respondenten gevraagd om het antibioticagebruik op hun bedrijf te kwantificeren. We hebben de cijfers vergeleken met antibiotica rapport van de SDa uit 2019. We zagen geen significante daling in het gebruik van antibiotica onder de respondenten na het volgen van de Eveal modules vergeleken met de cijfers uit het SDa rapport.
We concluderen dat het Eveal programma wel veranderingen in gedrag teweeg kan brengen in het kader van verandering in houding tegenover preventieve maatregelen, verandering in het sneller ingrijpen wanneer er iets mis is met de dieren en verandering in de manier waarop ze naar de dieren kijken. Er moet wel rekening worden gehouden met het feit dat deze veranderingen niet significant bewezen zijn en daarom kan verder onderzoek worden gedaan. Ook kan dan worden gekeken naar andere theoretische modellen, zoals de ‘theory of planned behaviour’ om een verklaring te vinden voor de gedragsveranderingen."
Phantomless bone mineral density assessment in patients using dual-energy CT,"['Offenberg, Ryanne']","['Vincken, Koen']",2021-10-29T11:01:11Z,EN,"['Bone mineral density, Dual-energy CT, Dual-layer detector CT, Material decomposition, Osteoporosis']",Medical Imaging,"OBJECTIVES – To evaluate the accuracy of bone mineral density (BMD) measurement using various three-material decomposition approaches.
METHODS – Six three-material decomposition methods were developed to quantify BMD in the first lumbar vertebra of 15 patients. Virtual monoenergetic images at 50 and 200 keV were employed for the analyses. Spectral data were decomposed into calcium hydroxyapatite (HA), red bone marrow or water, and marrow adipose tissue. HA-based BMD measurements were compared to corresponding quantitative CT (QCT) results.
RESULTS – Strong linear correlations, but lack of agreement was found between the results obtained with the three-material decomposition methods and QCT. Spectral-based BMD values were substantially overestimated compared to QCT measurements. Average Hounsfield unit values at 50 and 200 keV inside the regions of interest suggested the presence of tissue that was not evaluated in the decomposition analyses. Furthermore, the three-material decomposition methods detected physiologically questionable volume fractions in some patients.
CONCLUSIONS – The three-material decomposition methods developed in this study show promising correlations with QCT, but further research is required to improve accuracy."

Due to an absence of Conversation Analysis (CA) studies into the phenomenon of individual plurilingualism, little is known about its interactional consequences or its manifestation in conversational activities. This research explores the relationship between plurilingualism and conversational repair, an activity that can be enacted on one’s own talk (self-repair) or on the talk of another (other- repair). Schleghoff et al. (1977) note that the face-threatening nature of repair gives rise to a preference for self-repair in almost all contexts. However, Norrick (1991) finds that certain speaker dynamics – such as those in teacher/student or native/non-native speaker configurations – can disrupt this organization of repair. This study takes 11 conversations between native and non-native speakers of English as its CA corpus, where the 11 native speakers represent varied PPC scores. The study looks for evidence of repair preferences indexing speaker orientations to linguistic power asymmetries. Analysis reveals that both more and less plurilingual native speakers display a preference for self-repair in conversations with non-native speakers, although native speakers who score higher on the PPC scale tend to orient to the NNS status of their interlocutor and employ a pedagogical stance more readily than those who score lower on the PPC scale."
What is missing for citizens to engage in building resilient cities? A comparative assessment of Amsterdam and Valencia,"['Gibbs Chumillas, Darien']","['Hegger, Dries']",2021-10-29T11:00:56Z,EN,['Urban Resilience; Citizen Engagement; Social Resilience; Adaptation; Urban Transformations; Amsterdam; Valencia'],Sustainable Development,"Cities in Europe and the world are facing increasingly uncertain climate threats. Extreme weather patterns, higher temperatures and rising sea levels are but some of the worrisome climatic trends. Rapid densification and growth in cities have made managing and adapting these areas a more complex undertaking for local governments and stakeholders. This raises questions as to the role citizens and communities have in tackling this complex problem. Increasing complexity requires a complex solution. Urban resilience has become a prominent concept among urban policymakers and practitioners to cope with uncertainty and complexity in cities. However, its conceptualisation has often been dominated by its technical and environmental connotations, limiting the consideration of social aspects and elements in contemporary urban transitions. This research seeks to address this knowledge gap by enhancing an existing urban resilience framework with social resilience insights. This framework is used to evaluate the urban resilience capacities (capacity to prepare, absorb, recover, adapt, and transform) through a case study of two European cities: Amsterdam and Valencia. This research was complemented by an internship at the Centre for Global Challenges (UGlobe), more specifically in the Transformative Innovation Policy Consortium (TIPC). Amsterdam and Valencia are found to have taken different paths to adapt their urban area, lead to varying resilience emphases. Amsterdam has focused more on water management and adaptive spatial planning and displayed more evidence of bottom-up adaptation. The city has been more focused on preparing, adapting, and transforming to climatic threats. Valencia’s emphasis has been on emission reductions and energy efficiency, showing signs of mitigating rather than adapting to climatic threats. This leaves its resilience emphasis less clear. A variety of hampering factors and mechanisms have been identified for both cities: low awareness and appropriation of measures, an existing implementation gap for local adaptation, gentrification impacting social equity, fragmentation from specialisation, and administrative deficits. The presence of networks and intermediaries was found to positively influence resilience in the cities. While citizen and community engagement are of importance, the appropriation and legitimate adoption of adaptation measures by private entities is vital. This proves to be a key factor when consolidating urban governance strategies to enhance resilience. Factors and mechanisms are discussed within the broader academic literature and societal context, specifically when it concerns citizen-city interactions and urban transformations, and in relation to what the results of this study suggest for urban governance in the wake of growing uncertainty and complexity of threats."
Food and the Global Biodiversity Challenge: An exploration of how urban food governance can be part of the solution,"['Piel, Mira']","['Bulkeley, Harriet']",2021-10-29T11:00:47Z,EN,['biodiversity loss; urban food governance; discourse coalitions; problem frames; co-benefits'],Sustainable Development,"Worldwide biodiversity is declining faster than any time in human history. This threatens the proper functioning of ecosystems and ultimately human existence itself. Food production is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss. As cities accommodate the majority of the world population and thus constitute centres of resource consumption, the urban food system is a potential point of intervention to address the global biodiversity challenge. So far, answers to the question which role cities can play in the solution to halt biodiversity loss beyond their own jurisdictional boundaries are limited. To understand how cities can become active players in the global biodiversity challenge, this research explores urban food governance in relation to urban, regional, and global biodiversity. Based on the discourse coalition approach, it examines eleven urban food strategies (UFSs) from cities that are members of the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact. The analysis results in four problem frames that the UFSs make use of: a productionist frame, a dietary change frame, a resource efficiency frame, and a welfare frame. While all UFSs use these four frames, they tell different storylines to interpret and connect them with each other. For a smaller sample of three cities – Cologne, Copenhagen, and London – I conducted an in-depth analysis of urban food governance instruments in place in the cities that have a direct or indirect effect on biodiversity either in or outside of the city. In the context of the different problem frames and storylines in urban food governance, four main findings emerge. (1) Cities have a strong public health mandate and most of the UFSs emphasise the importance of a healthy diet. Accelerating the protein transition (reducing the amount of animal proteins in our diets) offers potential for synergies between biodiversity conservation and health. (2) Many cities are in favour of a stronger regionalisation of their food system, however, as scientific evidence of environmental benefits of local and regional food is thin, regional food should always be coupled with other characteristics, like seasonal food production or environmental criteria such as organic agriculture. (3) Cities should incorporate food more strongly into their work on the circular economy to diversify instruments tackling food waste. Lastly, (4) urban agriculture offers a lot of opportunities for citizens: It offers room for education, relaxation, and community building. Cities that see urban agriculture primarily as a means for local food production, should also recognise these social benefits. The results show that except for urban agriculture, these instruments address regional and global biodiversity loss. This confirms the potential of cities to become transformative actors in the global biodiversity challenge and the importance of further research on this topic."

The ‘Refugee Crisis’ has been studied by many scholars because of its urgency. This study aims to unravel the inherent racism that has been strengthened as a consequence of economic and ideological crises that facilitated the Extreme-Right party to climb the political ladder in Greece. More specifically, it focuses on the inspection of a far-right party (Golden Dawn) and how this party managed to polarize the national perception of both migrants and refugees as dangerous for the country’s identity and culture. By applying the Securitization Theory and the concept of Postcolonialism, an antithesis between the securitization process and the protection of the nation and the marginalization of the refugees according to xenophobic and prejudiced attitudes came to the surface. Based on secondary and a variety of primary sources this qualitative research offers significant results regarding migration in Greece. The consequences of xenophobia, racism, and violence against asylum seekers in the country have become part of the humanitarian issue whereas, the inability to properly address this matter has only increased the frustration among people."

Particularly considering this societal context, online theatre challenges our understanding of theatre and the social since both are still largely associated with encounters of bodily co-presence in daily language use but also partially theoretical discourse. Based on the virtual theatre lab of the Dutch collective Nineties Productions tak-ing place in March and April 2021, this master thesis explores assembly in online theatre as a staged social practice through digital ethnographic fieldwork. The research basically asks how to assemble in online theatre and explores this alongside participatory observation with theories from sociology, theatre, and media studies. Through applying above all Judith But-ler´s research regarding the performativity of the assembly, as well as Erika Fischer-Lichte´s phenomenology of theatre and Steve Dixon´s exploration concerning digital per-formance, my findings allow for new perspectives on concepts of publicness, interfacing, liveness, and presence regarding theatrical assembly in online theatre. At the same time, they reveal new staging strategies for facilitating up to evoking assembly in digital realms in terms of translating phenomena of corporeal co-presence. In this way, this exploration char-acterizes online theatre as an exciting field for reflecting on and experimenting with forms and phenomena of public assembly and socialising in distance."

Reversing latency followed by killing of cells harboring HIV, the “shock and kill” approach, is widely investigated. Toll-Like receptor (TLR) agonists, especially those targeting TLR7 and/or TLR8, are candidates in achieving HIV cure. This review analyzes and compares in vivo research conducted on these agonists, and provides an in-depth overview of benefits, limitations, and challenges regarding TLR7 and/or TLR8 agonist therapy for curing HIV.  
PubMed was searched for relevant literature, and after screening, nine articles were included in this review. 
TLR8 agonist treatment has not yet been assessed in vivo, but may play crucial roles in eliminating the viral reservoir in cells from monocytic origin. TLR7 agonist monotherapy using vesatolimod is thus far the only treatment investigated in HIV-infected humans, and does not affect the size of the viral reservoir, although one study reports an increase in time to rebound after ART cessation. Combination therapy of TLR7 agonists with broadly neutralizing antibodies or prime-boost immunization yields variable results regarding effects on reservoir size and time to rebound. 
This review has failed to observe the ability of TLR7 agonists to achieve latency reversal, although immune modulation was observed. The latter might be a key effect of TLR7 agonists rather than the former, indicating roles for TLR agonists as adjuvants. Overall, inconsistent results, together with limited clinical relevance, and study and population heterogeneity, pose significant challenges in taking TLR7 agonists as treatment for HIV to the clinic."

Incidence increases due to aging and adjuvant therapies improve. This results in increased number of survivors dealing with the long-term side effects of chemotherapy like a diminished quality of life. Studies have previously investigated the short-term effect of physical activity during adjuvant chemotherapy on the quality of life, but the long-term effects are yet to be established. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term effect of physical activity during adjuvant chemotherapy on quality of life in breast cancer patients

Methods   This study is prospective follow-up study, being a sub analysis of the ongoing PACT-PACES-HEART study. Patients are recruited from the original PACT and PACES studies. The EORTC quality of life questionnaire was used to calculate the overall quality of life and the quality of life on five subscales. A linear mixed effects model was used to assess the between-group differences and account for four timepoint measurements. 

Results   177 patients were included. The mean age of all participants was 59 years. The mean BMI was 25,8. Most women were post-menopausal, above 90% both the intervention and control group. An ER-positive, PR-positive, Her2Neu-negative tumor was most common. The mean follow-up was 8,5 years.  At 8,5-year follow-up, both intervention and control groups showed improved results compared to timepoint one on the quality of life scales, except for three scales. The overall quality of life in the intervention group and the cognitive functioning both the intervention and control group decreased. Analyzing the between-group differences, the overall quality of life, physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning and social functioning resulted in an adjusted mean difference in favor of the intervention group. The between-group difference for cognitive functioning resulted in an adjusted mean difference in favor of the control group. All results were not significant or clinically notable. 

Conclusions   Although results are not significant, being assigned to the intervention group did seem to have a slight positive effect on the overall quality of life, the physical functioning, the role functioning, the emotional functioning and the social functioning. Cognitive functioning decreases in both the intervention as control group, with a between-group difference in favor of the control group."

These three content courses in the curriculum are responsible for handling the EU according to the national curriculum. A qualitative textbook analysis shows that there is little coordination between these three content courses. On the one hand, this results in an overlap of topics, i.e., curricular surplus. On the other hand, there are content gaps, of which ‘the institutional functioning of the EU’ is the largest. A categorization of textbook tasks about the EU shows that mainly lower order thinking skills are examined. To achieve a more efficient curriculum alignment, it is important to develop a learning track that makes clear what, when and

Subsequently, the percentage of female secondary school students choosing science or technology subjects has increased, however the percentage increase of female students opting for STEM remains small. This study investigates the reasons why so few female students with science or technology subjects in secondary school pursue STEM studies. Non- anonymous questionnaires were conducted to examine whether fifth and sixth year pre- university students have considered STEM. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with both male and female students separately. The groups were further divided into students that did consider STEM and students that did not and finally divided into the highest and lowest achieving students.
The analysis of the obtained data showed that there was indeed a large gender gap for all students scoring lower than an average of 8, with less female students choosing STEM. In interviews, the main factors that female students attributed to influence their choices to pursue or not pursue the STEM field were: stereotypes about the study, about the people that belong there and the lack of information on what can be achieved as a STEM professional. Female students scoring relatively low on STEM subjects extended stereotyping to include low interest and low capability. As such, appropriate advice can be construed for secondary schools in the Netherlands to create gender awareness and decrease this gender gap."

Strengthening the parent-infant bonding contributes to physical, psychological and emotional development of their infant. 
Aim: From a parent’s perspective identifying nature, content, value, and impact of unscheduled conversations among parents and nurses and how these conversations inform planning infant care and involvement in caring for the infant in order to empower parents.
Method: A descriptive qualitative study using semi-structured web-based interviews was conducted among parents who had a premature infant admitted to the NICU. Thematic analysis was performed. 
Results: Twelve parents of fourteen infants between 26-39 gestational age were included. Parents searched for trust in issues they heard when they were bedside at their infant. Once they gained this feeling of trust, they talked about their personal life, well-being and thoughts. Parents heard how to provide basic care which strengthened them in being in control over their infant; they got empowered in their parental role. 
Conclusion: Parents established a relationship with nurses as they searched for trust during unscheduled conversations. Words of encouragement and support provided parents the opportunity to collaborate in providing infant care and make decisions regarding their infant. Parents became independent and in control over their infant. 
Recommendations: Implication for practice contains the importance of nurses creating parental awareness regarding self-care during admission to remain powerful in providing care for their infant. Furthermore, nurses should become aware regarding value and importance of unscheduled conversations. Further research is needed to determine the strategies of creating this awareness."
Exploring the psychosocial needs of adolescents whose parent is suffering from breast cancer.,"['Hertogh, L.']","['Oldenmenger, W.H.']",2021-09-03T18:01:32Z,en,"['nursing, breast cancer, parental cancer, psychosocial needs, adolescents']",Verplegingswetenschap,"Background: Cancer has a major effect on the individual patient and their family, especially their children. Adolescents who face parental cancer exhibit high scores in mental health problems as anxiety, stress and depression. Literature has focused on the impact of parental cancer in the well-being of children and young adults. However, little is known about the needs of adolescents whose parent is specifically suffering from breast cancer. Insights in the psychosocial needs are important in order to develop appropriate guidance and support for these adolescents. 
Aim: To explore psychosocial needs of adolescents whose parent is suffering from breast cancer to improve the support for these adolescents.
Method: This is a prospective, exploratory, qualitative study, performed in the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute. In-depth interviews were conducted with adolescents whose parent suffers from breast cancer. An interview guide was designed with the following topics: experiences, needs and support. The participants were selected purposively and approached via the parent(s) after the regular consultation. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed and thematically analysed using NVivo.
Results: A wide variety of psychosocial needs were discussed and five themes were defined: distraction, support, being able to talk about it, information and, to continue the normal life. No differences in needs were found between adolescents with a parent in the curative and palliative phase.
Conclusion: Adolescents whose parent suffers from breast cancer need the best possible preservation of their normal lives. It is important for them to be able to share their story and find support from someone close to them.
Recommendations: Healthcare professionals need to pay attention to the well-being of adolescents whose parent suffers from breast cancer and invite these adolescents to regular consultations so they are able to ask their questions to the professional."
Creating an ecovillage,"['Tijhuis, K.']","['Bäumer Escobar, V.', 'Lenting, K.']",2021-09-03T18:01:22Z,en,"['ecovillage, sociocracy, sustainability, capitalism, individualism']",Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"""The tensions and contradictions of navigating the creation of the biggest ecovillage in The Netherlands

Abstract 

In the next ten years, we will see a shortage of one million homes in the Netherlands. Feel free to call it a crisis, because the need is great. As a reaction to the housing climate and other social-cultural developments, alternative ways of living are gaining ground. Besides the impossibilities of getting (social) housing, there is also the factor of loneliness, which is mainly caused by the individualistic objective that is perpetrated in capitalist society. As a reaction to these social-cultural movements communal living arrangements are becoming more common. 

Ecovillages offer the opportunity to plan, present and put into practice alternatives for an increase in four different dimensions of sustainability; economic sustainability, ecological sustainability, cultural sustainability, and social sustainability. The ecovillage is a place to embody and articulate norms, patterns and principles that explore sustainability and holistic living. However, the term “ecovillage” is self-assigned, the question still remains how ecologically sustainable the community actually is (Dias et al. 2017). The most sustainable aspect was the fact that most residents realized more sustainable solutions in their houses by working together as a community, they realized things that would be inaccessible for the individual (Dias et al. 2017). 

Ecovillage Zuiderveld is the biggest ecovillage in The Netherlands. Their goal is to create a more sustainable way of living, they do this by trying to choose more ecological options regarding the houses they live and the choices they make. But also, by changing the dynamics of a more individual society by providing and maintaining more communal living arrangements.

I examine the ways in which members of this ecovillage experience building an ecovillage, their relations with external parties and how they try to live in a sustainable context. Their journey is not without its trials and tribulations. Residents try and incorporate structure and equality in the community by governing according to sociocratic values. """

Only in the last few years, the second generation started speaking up by creating an activist foundation. This research will look through Essed’s (2001) concept of everyday racism and Antonsich’s (2010) framework that presents belonging as the interplay between the politics of belonging and the feeling of home. By using these frameworks, an image is constructed of how racism operates through everyday life and affects the sense of belonging. I will argue and add to these frameworks that the concept of belonging is also about creating your agency and sense of belonging or freedom in a country that continuously questions if you belong. While everyday racism affects the way you identify yourself and the extent to which you feel like you belong, the feeling of home is still quite solid because many are born and raised in the Netherlands. Feeling like the Netherlands is still your home is perhaps the base for many activists to become “activist citizens” (Isin 2009) and “knowing subjects” (Ortner 2005) to reposition themselves and claim their right to be treated equally. It shows the ability of the activists to construct their agency and create a sense of belonging in a country that continuously expresses forms of everyday racism and questions their belonging."
Changing Mindsets of Eighth and Ninth Graders Towards Growth: A study on the effectiveness of classroom interventions on mindsets,"['Gelauff, M.N.A.']","['Meulenbroeks, R.F.G.']",2021-09-03T18:01:42Z,en,"['fixed and growth mindset, mindset theory, student’s expectations']",Science Education and Communication,"Classroom interventions on the growth mindset are proven to be not always as effective as expected. Therefore, this study examines the actual mindset change classroom interventions achieve with eighth- and ninth-grade students. In the mentor class, a mindset intervention of two lessons presented students how mindsets work, what mindsets are and teaches them how to adapt their self-perception; e.g., share gained knowledge and analyse feedback. According to pre- and post-test questionnaires in the physics and mentor class (N=32) and focus group interviews after the intervention (N=6), mindset change did not occur directly after the intervention. Therefore, the mindset intervention was not effective in both direct and transfer situations. The pre- and post-tests indicate a slightly changed perception in class A and an unchanged students’ perception in class B. The interviews provide two insights into the cause. Firstly, after the intervention the students did not use mindset as a concept correctly, therefore the teaching goals remain unachieved. Secondly, according to eighth and ninth graders, an effective classroom intervention has four crucial elements: (1) a clear purpose, (2) clear teaching method, (3) relevant content, and (4) high variation in lesson activities. These elements result in guidelines for designing an effective intervention in future research."
"Living as a ‘difference’ in a decidedly racist society: the case of immigrants in Athens, Greece","['Poursanidi, A.']","['Bolt, G.S.']",2021-09-01T18:00:46Z,en,"['Ethnic identity, Institutional racism, Urban space, Immigrants’ Adaptation, Doing Difference']",Urban and Economic Geography,"Aiming to interpret the electoral success of Golden Dawn (2012) and the racist violence that followed on the streets of Athens, this study searches for sources of racism in the Greek ethnic identity (Greekness) and investigates its effects on immigrants. To address the first question this research analyses discourses that dominate Greeks’ understandings of (ethnic) self and others, along their daily and life-paths. To examine how those understandings shape immigrants’ realities, I conducted unstructured interviews and participatory observation with first and second-generation immigrants. The research found that racism is the outcome of Greeks’ participation in practices organized by state institutions and social systems (Education system, Religion, Media and Clientelism, Urban space) informed by Greekness. In short, racism is the result of Greeks “acting Greek”, that is, in accordance with Greekness’ principles. The strategies immigrants employ, to avoid the consequences of racism, constitute a response and add the knowledge of how to “act differently”. This thesis concludes that addressing the problem of racism in Greece in accordance to immigrants’ knowledge of how to do difference could lead to radical social changes, up to redefinition of country’s main structural principle - Greekness itself."
Towards Just Urban Greening: Developing a diagnostic framework for collaborative urban planning as a means for just urban greening initiatives in Amsterdam,"['Kallenberg, M.']","['Patterson, J.J.']",2021-09-02T18:00:12Z,en,"['urban greening, environmental justice, collaborative urban planning, diagnostic framework']",Sustainable Development,"Urban greening is a climate adaptation strategy that tackles multiple social and environmental challenges in urban areas, two important ones being heat reduction and increased social wellbeing. Because of the positive social and environmental effects, it is important that urban greening takes a just and inclusive approach, with equal decision-making processes and recognition of existing inequalities, so that everyone can reap the benefits. Collaborative urban planning (CUP) is a governance strategy that takes an inclusive approach in urban planning practices and thus has the potential of providing a just output on urban greening. This research tries to further develop theory on environmental justice and urban greening, by critically scrutinizing collaborative urban greening initiatives through an environmental justice lens, which provides insights in how recognition, procedures and distribution play out. This has been done by taking an explorative multi case study approach. First, a literature research was conducted on urban greening, environmental justice and collaborative urban planning. This resulted in the development of an analytical framework, which was applied to three collaborative urban greening initiatives throughout Amsterdam by conducting semi-structured interviews, a document analysis and observation. A diagnostic framework was then developed based on theory and enriched with empirical findings of this research, through abductive reasoning. It aims to guide a focus of inquiry towards just urban greening, by asking critical diagnosing questions. It bridges theory to practice and is meant to guide practitioners towards just urban greening. The results stress the interconnectedness of the three environmental justice dimensions and reveal some important issues. CUP enhances quality (preservation) of the green spaces and awareness on the importance of urban greening. The identity and type of stakeholders is determined by structural inequalities, and what their priorities and intentions are, is important for just procedures and outcomes. Therefore, recognition should serve as a starting point for CUP to enhance just urban greening. Additionally, institutionalization of the three interconnected environmental justice dimensions in CUP is important. This research therefore concludes that collaborative urban planning enhances just outcomes of urban greening, often through just procedures. However, there is a need for increased recognition of existing inequalities and institutionalization to further pave the way towards just urban greening."
"'Biodiversity, a 'regrettable' solution for climate change?' A discourse analysis on the governing of biodiversity by Transnational Climate Initiatives","['Fransen, A.']","['Bulkeley, Harriet']",2021-09-02T18:00:13Z,en,['Biodiversity; Governmentality; Transnational Governance; Transnational Climate\nInitiatives (TCI); Discourse Analysis'],Sustainable Development,"The loss of biodiversity is argued to be among the largest environmental problems today as it impairs
the long-term viability of the world’s ecosystems. In order to halt this complex problem, it is
increasingly argued that there is a need to move away from ‘cockpit-ism’ and instead include a broader
range of actors. This recognized potential of non-state actors sheds light on another challenge, in
which there is increasingly attention drawn to nature by actors operating outside the biodiversity
domain – notably in terms of Nature-Based Solutions (NbS). Biodiversity or nature are here
constructed as potential ‘solutions’ for a range of issues, such as climate change. However, framing
nature or biodiversity as a ‘solution’ or ‘service’ for issues such as climate change, will result in certain
biodiversity aspects to be overlooked or downplayed. Nevertheless, there are notable gaps in the
understanding of framing and governing of biodiversity by actors operating outside the classic
biodiversity domain. Especially interesting are the actors who already derived ‘legitimacy to act’ for
being proactive on climate change and are increasingly entering the biodiversity arena - Transnational
Climate Initiatives (TCI). Therefore, this research aims to get a better understanding in how biodiversity
is framed and governed by TCI by performing a discourse analysis. This research draws on a
governmentality lens of Michel Foucault which assists in assessing how TCI define the problem of
biodiversity (so-called ‘rationalities') and how these are governed through techniques and accordingly,
how they generate the authority to exert their influence. This research reveals two overarching
rationales of biodiversity as a means to climate change and biodiversity loss as ‘risk’ which are
rendered governable through a myriad of techniques, such as standards, tools and guidelines. Through
the ‘taken-for-granted’ and habitual nature of these rationales and techniques, these TCI gain
authority to exert their influence. However, a governmentality lens points to several dangers in
constructing biodiversity as ‘extended administrative domain’ of climate change in which biodiversity
is reduced to their function or service they have for combatting climate change. Consequently, this
study argues that framing and constructing biodiversity in terms of ‘services’ or ‘solutions’ could turn
into a dangerous, ‘regrettable solution’."
The effect of proximity on knowledge network dynamics during economic recession: A study of the Great Recession,"['Ott, J.']","['Wanzenböck, Iris']",2021-09-02T18:00:14Z,en,"['Knowledge networks, network dynamics, recession, resilience, proximity']",Innovation Sciences,"The impact of recessions on firm performance is unequal across firms, but questions on what causes these differences remain unanswered. To explain firm performance, increasing attention has been given to interfirm knowledge networks. Existing studies showed that different forms of proximity can explain the dynamics of these interfirm networks, but none of these studies analysed the effect of the proximity dimensions during times of economic recession. This study addresses this knowledge gap by answering the following research questions: Which proximity dimensions drive the formation of innovation network ties in the European biotechnology industry? And did the effects of these driving forces change during the Great Recession?

Previous studies found that firms prefer collaborations with proximate partners as this reduces the costs and uncertainty of collaborations. This study assumes that proximities will play an even larger role in partner selection during times of economic recession, as firms might try to minimize costs and avoid uncertainty even more than in normal times. In turn, this can harm firm innovativeness as too much proximity between partners reduces the scope of learning.

With the use of the state-of-the-art stochastic actor-oriented model RSiena, the effect of cognitive, organizational, geographical and social proximity on tie formation was studied in a dynamic manner for Germany, the leader in the European biotechnology industry. With the use of patent data inventor networks were constructed. Next, estimations were made for four different time periods (2005-2007; 2007-2009; 2009-2011; 2011-2013) to study how the effects of the proximity dimensions on tie formation changed during the recession. 
As expected, inventors were significantly more likely to initiate collaborations with proximate partners. Strikingly, the effect of proximity on tie formation did decrease during the recession period. The German innovation strategy can partly explain these results. As governmental R&D investments increased during the recession, German firms might have been less inclined to reduce costs and choose more proximate partners. 

To validate the results of Germany, they were compared to those of Denmark (deploying a similar strategy) and the Netherlands (deploying a strategy based on reducing R&D expenses). The results of Denmark were similar to those of Germany. However, for the Netherlands opposite results were found as the effect of the proximity dimensions increased during the recession. Thus, if no specific innovation schemes are in place that financially support firms in crisis periods, the effect of the proximity dimensions increases, which can harm firm innovativeness."

Fibromyalgia (FM) and Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) share similar demographic and clinical characteristics; however, their aetiology and pathophysiology remain undetermined. Lumpers postulate that FM and CFS are simply different manifestations of a singular FSS, while ‘Splitters’ argue that they are separate FSSs. This study is part of a group project assessing the impacts of threats, soothers and drives on somatic symptoms. The current study focuses on the role of the soothing system, and investigates the potential ability of soothers to alleviate FM and CFS symptoms. Additionally, this study examines the experiential differences between these two FSSs, in order to add to the Lumpers versus Splitters debate. The sample consisted of FM and CFS patients (n = 804) aged 18 and over. Participants answered three questionnaires relating to the impact of soothers on their somatic symptoms, mental wellbeing, physical functioning, and how the syndromes affect their quality of life and overall health. The findings tentatively support the splitters perspective. Results revealed significant differences between CFS and FM regarding fatigue severity (the central symptom of CFS), and also indicated that balancing activities and relaxation was more important within CFS treatment in comparison to FM treatment. There were also differences in overall symptom severity, with FM patients being the least affected and patients with both FM and CFS being the most affected. This study highlights the potential utility of soothers within FM and CFS treatment. The results tentatively indicate that FM and CFS should be considered separate FSSs and provides a platform for future study in this area."

Individuals with this birth defect present impairments in social reciprocal behaviour. However, they often do not meet the full criteria of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The development of social functioning is an area of concern and it remains unclear how IQ is related. The aim of this longitudinal study was to give an overview of the social functioning profile in a sample of 22q11DS adolescents. The Social Responsiveness Scale – second edition (SRS-2) was used for measuring social functioning. We compared scores of social functioning on different timepoints to examine developmental trajectories. Additionally, we compared scores between adolescents with diagnosed ASD, any other psychiatric diagnosis and without a psychiatric diagnosis and explored the role of IQ on social functioning. Social functioning seems to decline between the ages 18,67 and 22,34 years (p = .036). Against the expectation, reported deficits in social functioning are clinically significant in the whole sample of 22q11DS adolescents, regardless of psychiatric diagnoses. Autistic mannerism are significantly more problematic in patients with diagnosed ASD (p = .022) compared to the other diagnosis groups. IQ is not significantly associated with social functioning. Current results highlight the importance of early and frequent evaluation of social functioning in adolescents with 22q11DS. More research is needed to investigate the observed decline of social functioning. Furthermore, a broader investigation of social deficits related to ASD in 22q11DS individuals in clinical practice and research may facilitate treatment for all patients experiencing social functioning problems. This can increase quality of life in 22q11DS individuals and their caregivers."

Parkour’s potential influence on resilience and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.","['Habbel, J.T.']","['Duin, E. van']",2021-09-07T18:00:40Z,en,['Parkour; Covid-19; pandemic; stress; resilience; mediation analysis'],Clinical Psychology,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic results in many adverse effects on peoples´ mental health like stress, for which resilience is a protective factor. Resilience can be built up and increased. This research proposed the previously untested idea that parkour could increase resilience and in turn reduce adverse effects on mental health like stress.
Methods: 738 included participants (mean age: 30.6, 51.4% male) filled out an online questionnaire including the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and questions about their main sport. Traceurs’ (people practicing parkour) stress- and resilience levels were compared to those of people doing other- or no sport. A correlation between stress- and resilience levels, a MANOVA and a mediation analysis (using PROCESS by Hayes) were conducted. Additionally, an ANOVA tested the relationship between traceurs’ training experience in years and their resilience.
Results: Participants’ resilience- and stress levels were significantly strong negative correlated. Traceurs displayed significantly higher resilience- and significantly lower stress than people doing other- or no sport and resilience levels acted as a mediator. Traceurs of varying training did not significantly differ in resilience levels, which was the only not confirmed hypothesis.
Conclusion: For the first time traceurs have been shown to have higher resilience- and lower stress levels. This is expected to reduce adverse effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and could have clinical implications. A causal relationship could not be established due to the research design, and suggestions for further research are given."
The Shared Signal Hypothesis in the Visual Search Paradigm with Real Faces,"['Hu, Y.Y.']","['Terburg, D.']",2021-09-07T18:00:40Z,en,[],Neuropsychology,"According to the shared signal hypothesis, the perception of faces is enhanced when the
emotion, gaze, and motivation are congruent. When threatening emotions are congruent with
gaze and motivation, it becomes relevant to the observer. For example, an angry face looking
at you is a direct threat whereas a fearful face looking away signals threat in the environment
relevant to you. Visual search studies using faces have yielded mixed results and most studies
have been compromised by low ecological validity. This study aims to tackle this limitation
by using real faces. 32 non-clinical participants completed a visual search task with multiple
trials representing each combination between the levels of emotion (angry, fearful), gaze
(direct, averted) and set-size (4, 8, 16). Gaze data were retrieved with an eye-tracker and traitanxiety was measured with a questionnaire afterwards. Multilevel models were performed to
assess differences in response times between all possible combinations. The results showed
that the shared signal hypothesis was only true for anger. Furthermore, fearful faces were
found faster than angry faces and once found, they were also faster identified as the emotional
target. Lastly, trait-anxiety levels did not moderate reaction times for self-relevant threat, but
did bias the individual to direct gazes compared to indirect gazes. Limitations include the lack
of an emotional intensity measurement of the stimuli and the small sample of models used for
the stimuli. The current study is a great stepping stone for future research investigating the
ecological validity of attentional biases to self-relevant facial threat."

Veel bewegingen hebben getracht hiertegen in opstand te komen, maar verandering blijkt lastig door radicale groeperingen die het ideaal van white-supremacy nastreven en aanmoedigen. Dit onderzoek focust op een schietincident tussen twee radicale bewegingen in de stad Greensboro, North-Carolina (VS), dat werd gekenmerkt als het ergste geweldsincident in Greensboro ooit. Het schietincident werd later benoemd als het Greensboro Massacre vanwege de bloedige afloop, maar stond voor aanvang bekend als de ‘Death to the Klan mars’, georganiseerd door de radicaal-linkse communistische partij CWP als protest tegen de radicaal-rechtse beweging Ku Klux Klan.

Focusing on a case study of a government agency, this study examines the attitudes of the employees towards CS, reasons why they code-switch, and how CS is applied. Seven employees from different departments were interviewed. The data were transcribed and analyzed using theories and previous research relating to CS: reasons why people code-switch (Malik, 1994), the markedness model (Carol Myers-Scotton, 1993), World Englishes (Kachru, 1988), and semiotic identity processes (Bucholtz and Hall, 2004). The results revealed that the employees do not have negative attitudes towards the use of CS nor towards the code-switchers. The employees mentioned that they were motivated to use CS because they see more benefits than disadvantages of applying CS in conversation. The common reasons provided by the interviewees were to express their membership in a group, to articulate an idea when having difficulty finding an appropriate word in Thai, to address different audiences, and for pragmatic reasons, i.e., replacing long Thai translated words with English words, transliterating English words to fit the Thai pronunciation and spelling system, and English technical terms in a Thai sentence, as well as using an appropriate amount of CS according to occasion and formality. The last reason is related to the context in which the employees code-switch, with respect to where CS is appropriate to occur and how much CS can occur in a sentence. In addition, the data revealed that the employees normally use CS at the word level and adapt standard English forms to localized Thai variants. Even though there are a number of previous studies on CS in the Thai context, no prior studies on Thai employees working for a government agency appear to have been investigated. Mostly, previous studies have been in education settings such as ESL or bilingual classrooms, in private companies in the hospitality industry or organizations that have direct contact with international clients and generally use English for work such as airlines and hotels, and in online platforms such as web chats and Facebook. In these settings, English is common and expected. This research focuses on an organization in which English is not promoted and Thai is expected to be strictly used in all communication. Hence, this research lays the groundwork for future studies of CS in Thai government sectors and fills in an apparent gap focusing on a context or an official institution where Thai is the dominant language and English is an additional language."

While its technological developments are often explored, little is known about the emerging 3D bioprinting organs innovation system (3D-BOIS) and its adoption at an organizational level. Hence, this research focused on two illustrative cases: University of California San Francisco Medical Centre and University Medical Center Utrecht. California is the frontrunner concerning 3D bioprinting organs, whereas the Dutch appear to be catching up. Hereby, developments from 2009 have been chosen as the Californian medical laboratory Organovo had a significant breakthrough in 3D bioprinted organs, resulting in the following research question: ""What are the barriers and potential solutions concerning hospitals' Institutional Readiness for the innovation system of 3D bioprinting organs in California and The Netherlands based on the emerging 3D bioprinting organ innovation system developments throughout 2009 – 2020?"".  To answer this question, the Technological Innovation System (TIS) and Institutional Readiness (IR) approach were combined into an integrated conceptual framework. The former was applied to obtain insights into hampering aspects in the emerging 3D-BOIS. An event analysis was performed, using information from desk research, on five out of the seven system functions: 1 (Entrepreneurial activities), 3 (Knowledge diffusion), 4 (Guidance of the search), 5 (Market formation), and 7 (Creation of legitimacy). The IR was applied as specific barriers can arise for healthcare innovations on an organizational level. This was analyzed by conducting semi-structured interviews with experts, either experienced within organ transplantations or innovations surrounding organ shortage. The findings indicated two common barriers for both 3D-BOIS's: 1) the need for a regulatory framework for 3D bioprinted organs and 2) the necessity for financial support by the Dutch government and venture capitalists in California. Further, two specific barriers were observed for the Californian and Dutch 3D-BOIS. Regarding the former, key actors within the Californian hospital are not fully aware of how different actors perceive 3D bioprinting technology nor which novel technologies can solve organ shortage. Concerning the Dutch 3D-BOIS, a high dependency on Dutch governmental institutions for financial resources for 3D bioprinting research and the ability of Dutch hospital staff to anticipate organizational challenges during the adoption of 3D bioprinted organs were observed. Further, this study corroborates a connection between the system functions and IR categories as the interactions between innovation on systemic and organizational levels are shown. Lastly, as this thesis focuses on developing the 3D bioprinting organs' innovation system technique, it provides a good starting point for developing a refined, integrated framework for interactions between TIS and IR."

Volgens Dahlberg (2007) wordt daarom de publieke sfeer van Habermas steeds belangrijker binnen de discussie van internet-democratie. De publieke sfeer is een onzichtbare en ontastbare plek waar mensen samen kunnen komen om openlijk alles te kunnen bespreken. Habermas, Lennox en Lennox (1974) identificeerden zes normatieve condities van de publieke sfeer. Daarvan zijn er twee onderzocht: uitwisseling van en kritiek op moreel- praktische geldigheidsclaims en discursieve inclusie en gelijkheid. Er is gekeken naar een Nederlands christelijk forum, omdat mensen binnen het christendom niet altijd exact dezelfde ideologie aanhangen. Dat kan zorgen voor botsingen. De twee grootste gemeenschappen zijn het katholicisme en het protestantisme. Door middel van een kritische discoursanalyse is aangetoond dat de participanten op een Nederlands christelijk forum zich vasthouden aan deze twee condities, omdat zij elkaars standpunten en argumenten verwelkomen ondanks dat de participanten niet altijd dezelfde ideologie nastreven, zoals het conservatisme versus een meer progressieve blik. Als gevolg daarvan bekritiseren de participanten elkaar op basis van intonatie, taalgebruik en feitelijkheid."
Rethinking Nature: Natural Heritage in the Cultural Memory,"['Hermans, M.A.']","['Huijnen, Dr. P.']",2021-09-07T18:01:04Z,en,"['Natural heritage, cultural memory, environmental ethics, UNESCO, nature, culture, dualism,']",History,"In a time of rapidly accelerating ecological crisis, thinking about nature and natural heritage is more crucial than ever. The natural aspects of decay and change seem to overtake the culturally imposed aspects of conservational practices. Meaning, the problem is the status of heritage as a rigid monument in our cultural memory and the inability of natural spaces to be completely suspended in time by preservative measures. This is the problem that is at the core or this theory-based thesis, which aims to understand how the breaking down of the culture-nature dualism in the twentieth century has influenced heritage practices and the status of nature in the cultural memory. Therefore, guided by Aleida Assmann’s theory on cultural memory, this thesis aspires to find a middle ground between the state of flux of nature and the rigid status of heritage. In doing so, this thesis beings with an exploration of contemporary environmental ethics and the revision of the dualism. A revision that set new standards for a more intertwined relationship between culture and nature. This perspective offers a new take on the maintenance  of our natural surroundings, which is relevant to natural heritage practices. The second part therefore shifts to the mapping of the twentieth century inclusion of nature in heritage practices, as exemplified by UNESCO. In the final part, the challenges of archival memory are counterbalanced by the inherent inclusion of nature in the cultural memory. This is due to the interconnection between nature and humanity, and therefore also culture."

It explores if Austen’s novel has feminist aspects and looks if a development of the feminist movement can be shown in three visual adaptations. To determine this development the adaptations will be linked to the feminist wave of their respective times. In this way Pride and Prejudice (1940) by Robert Leonard is linked to the first feminist wave. Joe Wright’s 2005 film associated with the third feminist wave. Whereas The Lizzie Bennet Diaries is tied to the fourth feminist wave. 
This thesis results in understanding that the development of the feminist movement is not always shown in the adaptations. Although Austen’s novel shows evidence of Enlightenment feminism, only The Lizzie Bennet Diaries shows an intentional connection to the fourth wave feminism. The 1940 and 2005 films show less to no association to their feminist waves because the subject of feminism was not intended for their audiences."

In dit onderzoek worden er historische verklaringen gezocht voor deze golf van demotivatie in het Amerikaanse leger. Hierbij ligt de nadruk op de complexiteit van oorzaken die leidden tot demotivatie. In het historiografisch debat over deze demotivatie wordt er vaak gezocht naar een eenzijdig antwoord om de verlaging van de moraal te verklaren. Dit onderzoek laat zien dat er niet één oorzaak voor demotivatie was, maar dat een tal van factoren een belangrijke invloed hadden op de moraal van Amerikaanse soldaten. Om deze veelheid van oorzaken aan te tonen wordt het onderzoek opgedeeld in verschillende dimensies. Door onderzoek te doen naar militaire, politieke en culturele oorzaken van demotivatie wordt aangetoond dat al deze verschillende dimensies een belangrijke invloed hadden op Amerikaanse soldaten. Door middel van primair bronmateriaal, dat voornamelijk bestaat uit dagboeken en interviews met veteranen, wordt aangetoond hoe deze verschillende factoren het gedachtegoed van de jonge mannen in Vietnam beïnvloedden."

Identifying the most feasible way to set up a living lab for food sustainability in the Netherlands,"['Gieben, T.P.A.']","['Rosales Carreón, J.']",2021-09-02T18:00:19Z,en,"['living lab, agri-food transition, agri-food system, agriculture, innovation, transition theories, feasibility, agroecosystems, sustainability, food, Sustainable Food Initiative']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Agricultural intensification, global climate change and a growing population are putting pressure on global food systems. The Netherlands plays a unique role in these systems because of its international hub of agricultural science, high agricultural productivity and responsibility for many negative effects of agricultural intensification. To achieve a transition to more sustainable agri-food systems, a living lab can help by providing an effective arena for cross-sector collaboration and experimentation. While academics argue for the use of living labs in fostering agri-food transitions, little research into this topic has been conducted. In this research, the feasibility of a living lab for agri-food transitions in the Netherlands was studied through a case study for the Sustainable Food Initiative (SFI). Desk research was used to construct a theoretical framework for the analysis of the feasibility of an agri-food transition living lab. Semi-structured interviews with SFI network partners were conducted to provide empirical data on stakeholder’s views on the SFI living lab and the concepts from the theoretical framework. Hybrid thematic analysis was used to analyse the data, resulting in themes that were deduced from the conceptual framework and induced from the data. The analysis shows that there are both strong differences and strong similarities along the respondents’ views on an SFI living lab. Most importantly, the results show that SFI network actors are interested and see the added value of a network with various actors from the value chain, experimentation in real-life settings and the use of co-creation. However, they struggle to see the role of the SFI in this, do not see the added value of involving citizens and governmental organisations as stakeholders and indicate that there is a lack of examples. Additionally, there is ambiguity regarding the definition, goal and organisation of an SFI living lab. These issues and some of the differences –amongst actors themselves and between actors’ views and theoretical feasibility– need to be addressed in order to maximise the feasibility of an SFI living lab. To aid in this process, this research provides 28 recommendations for the SFI to adhere to when setting up a living lab."
De gestage drup holt de steen,"['Veenen, C. van']","['Schouten, S.']",2021-09-07T18:01:25Z,nl,"['hunebedden,drenthe,erfgoed']",Geschiedenis,"Het lijkt bijna vanzelfsprekend dat de hunebedden de provincie Drenthe symboliseren. Toch zijn de steenhopen niet altijd erfgoed geweest. In de achttiende eeuw dreigden de hunebedden ten prooi te vallen aan sloping, waardoor er een resolutie verscheen om ze te beschermen. Echter pas in de negentiende eeuw kwam er meer aandacht voor de hunebedden en vond er een herwaardering plaats. In de Drentse politiek werd een strijd gevoerd om de monumenten te beschermen en ze het bezit te maken van de provincie of het Rijk. Eind negentiende eeuw was dit proces voltooid. De vraag is waarom juist in de negentiende eeuw de hunebedden beschermd erfgoed werden, terwijl ze er al vijfduizend jaar lagen en blijkbaar niet altijd even gewaardeerd werden. 
Deze studie onderzoekt hoe en waarom de hunebedden specifiek in de negentiende eeuw beschermd erfgoed werden. Daarvoor worden krantenartikelen, publicaties, enkele brieven en beleidsstukken bestudeerd op micro- en macroniveau. Er wordt gelet op taalgebruik (en dus ook framing en labelling) en de sociaal-culturele achtergrond van de bronnen wordt geanalyseerd. Op die manier wordt er, gekaderd door de theorie van Laurajane Smith, bekeken hoe de politiek (autoriteit) het proces van erfgoedwording heeft beïnvloed. 
Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat allereerst het opkomende nationalisme (en in het verlengde daarvan het regionalisme) een rol heeft gespeeld bij de herwaardering van de hunebedden als iconen van de vaderlandse geschiedenis en de zelfstandige provincie Drenthe. Ook de vele gevaren die de hunebedden in de negentiende eeuw bedreigden, waaronder de markeverdelingen en de aanleg van een spoorweg, maakten dat er meer aandacht kwam voor monumentconservatie. Als laatste heeft de grote bekommernis om de hunebedden door personen met autoriteit, zoals de mannen van het zogeheten Drentse Herenbolwerk en in mindere mate de redactie van de regionale krant, ervoor gezorgd dat de hunebedden erfgoed konden worden. De heren hadden er belang bij dat Drenthe een eigen regionale identiteit ontwikkelde en relevant werd voor de vaderlandse geschiedschrijving. 
Deze drie factoren maakten dat juist in de negentiende eeuw het proces van erfgoedwording kon plaatsvinden als het gaat om de hunebedden. Het feit dat in die tijd uiteindelijk alle hunebedden zijn aangekocht door of geschonken aan de provincie en het Rijk heeft ervoor gezorgd dat de hunebedden niet meer door inwoners van de marken of later door particuliere eigenaren konden worden gesloopt. Daarna zijn de hunebedden actief beschermd en soms zelfs in originele staat hersteld. De hunebedden werden zodanig Drents én Nederlands erfgoed."

is van mannelijk stereotiep eetgedrag. Westelijke landen, waaronder Nederland, genieten een
buitenproportionele vleesconsumptie. Echter, er wordt steeds meer bekend over desastreuze
gevolgen hiervan voor mens, dier en milieu. Een relevante vraag was daarom wat deze
vleesreductie tegenhoudt, en of recentelijke langzame normverschuivingen in eetpatroon en
genderrollen verschil maken (namelijk een stijging in vegetarisme en vermindering van
traditionele gendernormen). De verwachting was dat onder andere beoordeling door potentiële
vrouwelijke partners, die beïnvloed worden door traditionele gendernormen, een rol spelen bij
vleesconsumptie door mannen. In het huidige onderzoek werd daarom getoetst in hoeverre het
eetpatroon van mannen, via een invloed op hun beoordeelde mannelijkheid, invloed heeft op
hoe aantrekkelijk ze gevonden worden door vrouwen. De steekproef bestond uit vrouwelijke
participanten die werden verdeeld onder twee condities: één met een vignet over een omnivoorman,
de ander met een vignet over een vegetariër-man. Verder kregen participanten allen
dezelfde online vragenlijst voorgeschoteld, waarin demografische gegevens en de concepten
‘mannelijkheid’, ‘aantrekkelijkheid’ en ‘gezondheidsbewustheid’ werden gemeten. De
resultaten bevestigden beide hypotheses dat er ten eerste een effect was van eetpatroon op
aantrekkelijkheid, en ten tweede dat dit effect via mannelijkheid verliep. Dit impliceert dat
normverschuivingen tot op heden nog niet in onderzoeksresultaten zichtbaar zijn, hoewel dit in
de komende jaren wel wordt verwacht. Wegens de consequenties van hoge vleesconsumptie
voor natuur en mens, bevestigen de onderzoeksresultaten wederom de maatschappelijke vraag

In this thesis, the intentions and mechanics behind the Delphic monuments, both those built by the poleis and the votives offered by the aristocracy, will be investigated. Both sides are considered individually – poleis and their treasuries, and aristocrats and their votives – as well as in relation to each other. Attention is given to multiple aspects of the structures, including the context of their construction, their material and their decorations, and the key themes of the thesis are explored and illuminated case studies for either group. To this end, multiple types of sources will be combined, including literary, epigraphic and archaeological material. Following the view of historians such as Ian Morris, the treasuries will be placed in the context of the conflict between polis-aligned, or “middling” aristocracy on the one hand, and the conservative “elitist” aristocracy on the other. Ultimately, the treasuries are complex structures, with unique local circumstances determining the precise intent behind them."

The core of this research consists of an analysis of ten different Tusványos- and State of the Nation-speeches, that are conducted by Orbán in the period of 2014-2020. The speeches are examined on the presence of core-definitions of Mudde’s populistic definition: “the people”, “the elite” and “the general will”. In this research it is found that in Orbán’s speeches the rhetoric of a “European elite”, the existence of a “homogeneous Hungarian culture-community” and the possibility to gauge “the general will of the Hungarian people” via the National Consultations, is frequently present. This research concludes by elaborating on the discursive patterns in Orbán’s rhetoric. Orbán makes use of contradictions, common-sense solutions and the communistic past, to achieve national unification and to bind the electorate for the long-term."

Seasonal Forecasting of Rainfall in Equatorial East Africa using an Artificial Neural Network,"['Beunk, J.']","['Sterk, G.', 'Wanders, N.']",2021-09-07T18:01:46Z,en,['seasonal; rainfall; forecasting; east africa; kenya; neural network; lstm; long short-term memory; ecmwf; seas5; hybrid; teleconnections; el niño southern oscillation; indian ocean dipole; madden-jullian oscillation; long rains; short rains; drought; anomalous rainfall'],Earth Surface and Water,"The eastern African region continues to be extremely vulnerable to droughts. In Kenya alone, about 50 million people have been affected by droughts since 1983. Rainfall in the region is bi-modal, with the long rains in the boreal spring and the short rains in the boreal autumn. Seasonal forecasts of rainfall are essential to improve drought preparedness and mitigation for water managers and farmers. The aim of this study was to forecast monthly rainfall totals at a set of locations in the equatorial east African region, using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) called a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The input dataset consisted of seasonal forecasts (SEAS5) of precipitation and temperature from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in combination with several climate indices related to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). The performance was assessed by means of the WNDI (Weighted Non-Dimensional Index) and the anomaly correlation. Benchmarks for the evaluation included: climatology, precipitation forecasts by SEAS5 and a multi-variate linear model based on the same input data as the LSTM. In addition, the ability of the model to forecasts anomalous seasonal rainfall was assessed based on the 2x2 contingency table and associated scores (hit rate, false alarm rate and Clayton Skill Score). Sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the relative importance of the features in the input dataset. 

For all lead times, the LSTM outperformed both the linear model and SEAS5 in terms of both anomaly correlation and WNDI, although it is not clear whether or not this is statistically significant. Especially at longer lead times the LSTM shows improved performance relative to SEAS5, due to a good coupling with the climate indices. At a lead time of 4 months and in terms of WNDI and the anomaly correlation, differences in performance between the long rains and the short rains were small. The LSTM model showed slightly better performance with a WNDI of 0.75-0.85 (equal to an RMSE of 6-7% of the mean annual rainfall) and an anomaly correlation of 0.76-0.77, compared to the linear model. In the context of anomalous seasonal rainfall, the performance in the short rains was substantially better, on average, with hit rates between 40-50%, false alarm rates of 4% and Clayton Skill scores of roughly 0.7. The linear model performed better at forecasting below-normal rainfall in the short rains. The LSTM showed better performance in the long rains, especially when forecasting below-normal rainfall, with a hit rate of 42%, false alarm rate of 8% and a Clayton Skill Score of 0.55, on average. With regard to operational use, especially forecasts of anomalous rainfall are of interest, as they may be associated with the occurrence of floods and droughts. The model developed in this study is underconfident in forecasting these anomalies and are therefore not sophisticated enough for operational use. However, due to the observed low false alarm rates, it may still provide valuable information to farmers and water managers near the stations. Several suggestions are made for the improvement of the model developed in this study."
Identify and visualize Dutch inland waterways vessel movement anomalies during low water levels,"['Chang, C.']","['Meijers, M.', 'Baart, F.', 'Werff, S. van der']",2021-09-07T18:01:46Z,en,['AIS; inland waterway; movement data analysis; Waal; vessel; low water level'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"This MSc thesis aims to develop a workflow analyzing inland vessel traffic anomalies during low water levels by using historical automated identification system (AIS) data. Low water level impacts inland waterway transports because cargo ships must carry less weight in order to stay safe and afloat. The consequences are the same amount of freight needs more trips to be transported comparing to normal water level times, and more trips lead to busier waterways and higher freight rates. Many inland transportation reports and news articles have discussed the impacts of low water levels on inland shipping, but not many studies have used AIS data and water level data to analyze the relationship. Thus, this research tries to fill in this gap in two aspects: validate the market observations and detect vessel interaction anomalies.
AIS is a system that broadcasts vessel status and information to other vessels in the same area, so vessels can know each other’s whereabouts and act accordingly. The information contained in AIS data are categorized as dynamic and static information, the first changes depending on the position and movement of the vessel, while the latter is about vessel identity and voyage information such as vessel IDs, destination, vessel types, and vessel size. The spatial and temporal information in AIS data can provide researchers an opportunity to look into this topic from a different perspective. Therefore, the research question is: to what extent can historic AIS data contribute to the analysis of the impacts brought by low water level in inland waterways?
The research was divided into two phases. First, four statements were summarized based on news articles and market reports, and a workflow was developed to validate those statements with AIS data analysis. Second, the vessel interaction anomalies were narrowed down to starboard side encounter events, which are allowed under certain conditions in the study area. Ship encounters were detected by the distance to the other ship, then the encounter events were classified by which side of the ship they met. 
The study results show that AIS data can be used to identify how busy the waterway was by extracting and counting the number of trips. However, analysis that uses draught value as the data source is not recommended since the draught values in AIS data are not reliable. The analysis on the speed and water levels shows no correlation between these two elements, thus the statement is not true. On the other hand, the results of vessel size changes indicate that there are no significant patterns regarding vessel size and water levels, which might be because of a wrong study area. Lastly, the analysis results of ship-encounter anomalies present that starboard side encounters are related to how busy is the waterway."

However, in developing countries, this information is often unreliable, unavailable or inaccessible, and manual data collection is time-consuming. This can lead to difficulties for humanitarians or policymakers in implementing appropriate disaster risk reduction and response interventions. Therefore, there is a need for the development of alternative approaches to data collection and analysis. An alternative approach to on-site vulnerability assessment is to extract physical vulnerability characteristics, such as land use type or rooftop material, from satellite or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery. However, it is often not possible to extract other social or physical vulnerability information on the household level from solely from remote sensing data. This research develops an approach for integrating multiple data sources into a Geographic Information System to improve the completeness of data on different vulnerability indicators. This approach is applied to the housing stock of the Karonga district in Malawi. An Object-Based Image Analysis of UAV imagery is combined with a machine learning analysis of Mapillary data to enable remote identification of both rooftop and wall material. Depth-damage curves were created to describe the flood impact on the housing stock for different categories of physical
vulnerability (such as building material) and levels of inundation. Moreover, local survey data is used for the creation of a social vulnerability index. Combined, the datasets represent the spatial distribution of housing stock vulnerability for multiple flood scenarios. This approach is useful in situations in which proactive risk analyses must be carried out or local-scale interventions, such as building strengthening- or flood awareness projects, have to be implemented. Finally, recommendations are given for scaling the methodology to areas where only lower resolution data is available."

Assessing the distribution of wetlands and their extent is relevant to manage these environments. However, the lack of a universal definition and the use of different input data and methodologies to map wetlands can complicate the assessment. This study aims to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of three selected global products: GLWD-3, LC-CCI, and CW-TCI. Specifically, it defines the consistency on a thematic, spatial, and temporal level, while the accuracy assessment was completed with an independent integrated reference dataset. A comparison among the products was completed to determine their consistency to a global extent, and a regional analysis was included to assess the consistency of the global products in wetlands hotspots such as the Amazon and Congo Basins with regional datasets. The accuracy assessment showed an overrepresentation of wetlands for all maps at the global extent. Furthermore, the results reveal some definition inconsistencies that created disagreement for LC-CCI, while CW-TCI was considered unreliable for mapping wetlands due to the high disagreement and low classification accuracies. GLWD-3 had better definition consistency but missed mapping wetland areas in the Amazon and Congo Basins while having a high disagreement and overestimation for the class wetlands. As a result of the assessment, despite the overrepresentation of wetlands by all products, LC-CCI is more suitable for contemporary studies and GLWD-3 is an old dataset that did not perform better than the other products, while CW-TCI is not a reliable dataset. Based on these results, it is necessary for users to have a prior understanding of the wetland definition before choosing an appropriate product that meets their needs. The LCCS-based aquatic land cover characterization framework presented recently is recommended as a possible solution to improve the differences between aquatic land cover and generic land cover mapping. Lastly, researchers need to continue their assessments on products to highlight disagreements and determine their consistency over time."
Transport of groundwater contaminant through high density ATES regions,"['Ketelaars, M.M.A.']","['Schotting, R.']",2021-09-07T18:01:44Z,en,['ATES; ATES systems; contaminant transport; contaminant spreading; well placement; sustainable energy'],Earth Surface and Water,"Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) systems are a renewable energy technology which provides sustainable heating and cooling for the built environment. These systems store the surplus of thermal energy in summer and the deficit of thermal energy in winter in the groundwater to be able to recover this energy in the opposite season. The demand for ATES systems in cities is large, while aquifers beneath cities are often polluted. Therefore, the transport of contaminants through high density ATES regions is studied in this thesis.

The numerical SEAWAT model from the work of Jaxa-Rozen et al. (2015) was used. This model is created to study the temperature in the subsurface. To make the model suitable for studying contaminant spreading and dilution by ATES wells, a tracer contaminant was added as a second species and a method to model internal ATES transport was developed. First, the interaction between two doublets was studied for line and checkerboard patterns. In these 2x2 configurations, the distance between the wells, the well discharge and the ambient groundwater flow were systematically changed. Secondly, the spreading and dilution through an ATES region was studied with 4x4 well configurations. 

The results showed that the spreading and dilution by the implementation of ATES systems increases drastically. The policy distances in the Netherlands now inhibit the negative interference of thermal performance, but do not inhibit the external ATES transport between systems. However, the impact can be managed/limited by choosing a suitable well configuration. This study showed that the external ATES transport between wells of the same type is dominated by dispersion, which causes small spreading rates in a timeframe of one year. The transport between two opposite type wells is governed by short circuit flow, which causes large spreading rates in a timeframe of one season. Therefore, line pattern doublets are preferred if spreading of contaminants needs to be limited. In practice, this means that it would be best if the same type of wells are clustered and the distance between the opposite wells is kept at least at the policy distance. This is also beneficial for the thermal efficiency of the wells.

The downside of placing wells in line pattern is that the hydraulic head differences become large, causing increased groundwater flow. This increased groundwater flow can cause increased leaching from constant contaminant sources into the groundwater. Further study needs to focus on expanding this knowledge on constant contaminant sources and the implementation of that knowledge in ATES planning."
Tectonic control on Jurassic to Early Cretaceous sedimentation in the Dutch Central Graben; an integrated analysis of seismic and well log data,"['Dijk, G.A. van']","['Fadi Nader, Liviu Matenco']",2021-09-07T18:01:47Z,en,"['tectonics, halokinesis, Dutch Central Graben, syn-rift sedimentation']",Earth Structure and Dynamics,"One of the best illustrations of the complex interplay between extensional faulting, salt movement and eustasy is the deposition of the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous sediments in the Dutch Central Graben. We have quantified this deposition by a multi-scale tectonic successions approach employing two ENE-WSW seismic sections perpendicular to the strike of the basin. Our structural reconstruction of the interpreted seismic sections can be grouped in three main phases of basin development, starting with initial deposition focused on the basin center during sedimentation of the Schieland Group. This initial period was followed by deposition along the former basin margins in rim-synclines, which was coeval with the formation of well-documented turtle anticlines during sedimentation of the Scruff Group, followed by tectonic inversion. Building over the well-studied stratigraphic framework in the Dutch offshore, we present a higher resolution well-logs and seismic model of the Jurassic - Early Cretaceous which is able to differentiate 6 to 8 tectonic successions during the deposition of the Schieland Group. These tectonic successions demonstrate a laterally variable alternation of tectonic activity and quiescence controlling sedimentation. This interpretation contrasts with the analysis of the marginal Scruff Group, where results show that 3rd order sea-level fluctuations are the major control on observed sedimentary cyclicity expressed in well log and lithological data. Furthermore, the lateral variability of tectonic successions between the studied transects highlights the importance of local variability in deposition and facies distribution during syn-rift sedimentation in space and over time."
Dealing with an identity threat: Porsche and the transition to electric mobility,"['Brull, M.']","['Bidmon, C.']",2021-09-02T18:00:19Z,en,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Due to sustainable transitions, industries and organizations across the globe need to transform and align their product offerings and business practices with more environmentally friendly and socially accepted ways of operating. The movement towards this reality may come to confront organizations and industries’ business as usual, creating an identity threat. This is especially the case for incumbent organizations, who have reached their current market positions based on legacy business practices and products. Understanding how incumbent organizations deal with the identity threat within their external communication becomes important as theory acknowledges that an organization’s ability to communicate the process of change to its stakeholders and manage the expectations of these stakeholders as the organization transforms is as important as the act of changing processes, structures, and products.
This longitudinal study explains how an incumbent organization deals with an identity threat caused by a sustainable transition in its external communication, and identified which corporate identity elements does it alter, maintain, and disrupt. As empirical context, the study analyzed Porsche and the transition to electric mobility. The study used Porsche’s external communication (annual/sustainability reports and website for press-related matters) and interviews with Porsche’s senior executives, searched on Nexis Uni research database, during the period of 2005 and 2020. The data was first analyzed to reconstruct the case chronology and then analyzed for the identification of maintenance or change of corporate identity elements. This led to the identification of specific themes related to maintenance and change, which were then used to construct a process model that depicted how Porsche communicated about corporate identity change during this timeframe.
The findings demonstrate that Porsche does not disrupt any corporate identity elements within its communication but maintains three corporate identity sub-elements and changes five. Porsche’s communication about maintenance and change of specific corporate identity sub-elements interplay, creating, at times, an ambiguous message which creates an impression that Porsche is changing while remaining the same to possibly balance different stakeholder interests. Such dynamic sheds light on Porsche’s struggle to align itself to the sustainable transition and demonstrates that such transformational process is a slow and gradual one. The results can bring improved understanding of the transformational journey and deeper knowledge of what challenges and barriers incumbent organizations meet within the context of sustainable transitions."
INFLUENCE OF MATERNAL HEIGHT ON BIRTHWEIGHT CLASSIFICATION AND SEVERE ADVERSE PERINATAL OUTCOMES IN SINGLETON AT TERM BIRTHS IN THE NETHERLANDS,"['Mentink, S.']","['Henrichs, J.']",2021-09-07T18:02:28Z,en,"['Maternal height, Birthweight, Small for gestational age, Large for gestational age, Adverse perinatal outcomes']",Gezondheidswetenschappen voor zorgprofessionals,"Background: An accurate birthweight classification is important to prevent severe adverse perinatal outcomes (SAPO). Neonates who are small for gestational age (SGA, p≤10) or large for gestational age (LGA, p90) have a higher risk for SAPO. 
Aim: To assess the association between maternal height and birthweight in low-risk pregnancies and to investigate the effect of maternal height on the classification of birthweight as SGA and LGA. Secondly, to investigate whether maternal height has a predictive value for the risk of SAPO.
Method: An observational study using prospectively precollected data from the IRIS study was conducted (n=6970). The influence of maternal height on birthweight and SAPO was analysed. The number of neonates classified as SGA and LGA was calculated. Subsequently, the changes in classification from SGA and LGA to appropriate for gestational age (AGA) were calculated.
Results: A significant association was found between maternal height and birthweight (p&lt;.001) and maternal height and SAPO (p=.023). Shorter and taller women had a higher risk for SAPO. A logistic regression with maternal height squared showed that this curvilinear effect was not significant (p=.062). The incidence of SGA was 7.2% (decreasing from 17.9% to 2.9% in the shortest to tallest height categories) and LGA was 9.5% (increasing from 2.7% to 15.5%). A shift in classification was found for 18.1% of the SGA and 17.5% of the LGA neonates when controlling for maternal height. 
Conclusion: Maternal height is significantly associated with birthweight and SAPO. Customised birthweight charts based on maternal height changes the classification of around one in five SGA or LGA neonates at term. 
Recommendations: Validation studies to assess the predictive value of a customised birthweight chart based on maternal height on SAPO."

Single-sided deafness can result in two main difficulties; problems with localization and speech perception. Up until recently, a criterion for a cochlear implant was bilateral hearing loss. It is, still, difficult to predict the speech perception abilities of a single-sided deaf adult with a cochlear implant. 
Aim: The aim was to find a test which provides an accurate prognosis of speech perception in adult single-sided cochlear implant users. 
Method: This observational, correlational, cross-sectional study included 18 adults. The participants performed hearing in noise tests, a spectral resolution test, a vocabulary test, and a working memory test. A comparison of the mean group data is reported. Also reported are correlations between the tests and the context factors.
Results: The participants performed significantly better with their normal hearing ear compared to their cochlear implanted ear. The context factors j and k did not significantly differ. Significant high correlations were found between phonological processing and hearing in noise for the implanted ear and lexical context factor j. Significant moderate correlations were found between spectral resolution for the normal hearing ear and both the j factor for phonemes in a word and the k factor for the implanted ear. A significant low correlation was found between the k factor of the implanted ear and a hearing in noise result for the normal hearing ear. 
Conclusion and Recommendations: The results put phonological processing forward as a predictor for future performance in speech perception for single-sided deaf adults with a cochlear implant. It is, however, noteworthy that this study lacks power. Future research should include more participants and divide these participants up into subgroups."

This thesis investigates the code-switching behavior and purposes of the second-generation Armenian- Dutch society, as well as the connections between their identity and code-switching functions. Furthermore, this thesis compares to Nortier’s (2015) research on the code-switching behavior and aims of Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch bilinguals. A qualitative method was adopted by observing everyday conversations, conducting follow-up questions and interviews. Armenian-Dutch individuals employ code-switching to express their identity, feelings, and humor. They also utilize code-switching to cite others, make communication easier, and because of lexical need, semantic relevance, a lack of a language counterpart, or a cultural link to the topic. They likewise code-switch due to the trigger effect, out of habit, to add dramatic effect, or when criticizing others or sharing secrets. New functions that had not been discovered in the literature were to increase tension, to improve one’s linguistic abilities, due to a linguistic preference for specific terms, and simply inadvertently. Language preservation being an essential component of Armenian-Dutch identities reflects the code-switching function of strengthening one’s language skills, whereas the community’s strong grasp of Armenian culture and their pride in their race and culture is shown in the code-switching functions of conveying humor and expressing identity. The degree of the Armenian-Dutch society’s code-switching would fall between that of the Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch societies (Nortier, 2015). Given that both groups regularly code-switch for diverse reasons, an important one of which is to demonstrate their bilingual identities, the Armenian-Dutch community’s code-switching functions are strikingly similar to those of the Turkish-Dutch community."

PRODUCT SERVICE SYSTEMS FOR BOILERS; TOWARDS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY,"['Bommel, J. van']","['Rosales Carreon, Jesus']",2021-09-02T18:00:21Z,en,['Product Service System; Business Model; Circular economy; Boiler'],Sustainable Development,"Every year around 375.000 boilers are being discarded and end up as waste in the Netherlands. This is not in line with a circular economy. Product Service System Business Models (PSS BM) have great potential to increase the circularity performance in a business, which can reduce the impact on the environment. The heating sector in the Netherlands has potential to become more circular through servitization. This thesis aims to answer the following research question: “Which PSS BM for boilers could be implemented to enhance the transition towards a circular economy?” 
This thesis uses a case study approach, semi-structured interviews and a Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) to answer the main research question. The case study provides in-depth information on the current BM and alternative PSS BM’s for boilers. The semi-structured interviews present the needed insights from the perspective of multiple actors relevant in the current BM, whilst the MCA allows for the transformation and comparison of the collected data to alternative scenarios. 
The case study is Energiewacht, a company that sells boilers and provides product-related services. The analysis shows that the current BM of Energiewacht focuses on the product while services are an addition. Three alternative PSS BM types are identified. In every alternative, the level of service increased. The analysis shows that an increased level of service results in an increased level of circularity strategies that are present in the BM. The current BM and alternative BM’s are compared based on a set of values that are obtained from the interviews. These values indicate what actors perceive as important to be present in a BM. The product lease BM and the functional result BM scored the highest for these values. Additionally, the circularity performance of each BM is calculated, which shows that the functional result BM has the highest circularity potential. Thus, the functional result BM can be implemented to enhance the circular economy for boilers.
To increase circularity performance in the heating sector, this thesis recommends trialing the implementation of the functional result BM for boilers."
From feudal to market economy: Grain exchange in post-Plague Geneva (1350-1450).,"['Maillard, P.A.O.']","['Dijkman, J.E.C.']",2021-09-08T18:00:11Z,en,[],History,"The Black Death reduced European populations drastically when it hit the continent in the 1350s. Historians believe that the pandemic triggered the transition from a feudal to a market economy. The laborer shortage that it caused has emancipated peasants from serfdom as farmers started to market their products independently from lords. Alongside this ‘Commercial Revolution’ the Late Middle-Ages are also the period of another emancipation process, the ‘Communal Movement’. Prosperous urban communities aspired to govern themselves through legal charters, granting them political freedom vis-à-vis large realms. But how have these newly born city-states coped with the socio-economic shift set off by the plague? Scholars have emphasized measures that these towns have introduced to deal with these changes. Indeed, since 'free' markets meant less control and more uncertainty, this would be problematic for the supply of vital commodities such as grains. This thesis looks at the city of Geneva during the 1350-1450 time period and studies the 1387 franchises, a compilation of rights promulgated by the bishop Adhémar Fabri which has asserted the town as an autonomous commune. It hence looks at how this legal document have affected the Genevan exchange of that most important staple. Overall, are discussed plans to introduce standards of exchange such as official measures and currencies, but also attempts at regulating the city’s supply in grain, and finally the actual prices of that commodity up until the 1450s. The main takeaway of this thesis is that the legislators of the franchises have indeed attempted to control that market, for the ‘common good’ as well as for their own, but the analysis of grain prices would suggest that they were not able to do so since the prices became extremely volatile soon after the introduction of those measures."

Uit eerdere onderzoeken bleek dat vertrouwen in vaccins een belangrijke predictor is van vaccinatiegedrag. Het vertrouwen in vaccins wordt gevormd door het geloof dat een vaccin effectief is, dat het veilig is en dat het onderdeel is van een betrouwbaar gezondheids- en bestuurssysteem. Uit algemene argumentatietheorieën blijkt dat bij politieke en maatschappelijke boodschappen het noemen van voor- en tegenargumenten met weerlegging zorgt voor een hogere overtuigingskracht en geloofwaardigheid. Uit onderzoeken naar argumentatie rondom vaccinaties blijkt daarentegen dat het noemen van tegenargumenten met weerlegging juist een tegenovergesteld effect kan hebben op het vertrouwen. We hebben ons in dit onderzoek gefocust op de discrepantie tussen de algemene argumentatietheorieën en theorieën rondom argumentatie omtrent vaccins. We hebben met een enquête gemeten wat het effect was van de twee verschillende argumentatievormen op het vertrouwen in de COVID-19-vaccins. De resultaten van dit onderzoek laten geen significant verschil zien in het effect van beide argumentatievormen op het vertrouwen in vaccins. Uit de resultaten komt wel een sterk positief significant verband tussen vaccinatie-intentie en vertrouwen in vaccins naar voren.

De lexicale LaRa-afwijkingen konden gezien worden als code-switches en bepaalde fonologische/morfologische LaRa-afwijkingen kunnen geïnterpreteerd worden als convergentie. Daarnaast bleek uit de resultaten dat lingua receptiva niet geheel effectief werkt, maar het wel als effectief ervaren wordt.

Modelling governmental risk perception and coping appraisal during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands,"['Herwig, A.']","['Augustijn-Beckers, dr. ir. P.W.M', 'Anthonj, dr. C.']",2021-09-08T18:00:55Z,en,"['COVID-19, Pandemic, Modelling, Netlogo, Risk perception, Coping appraisal, Protection motivation theory, Agent-based']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"The novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious virus that started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and caused the disease COVID-19. It has since then rapidly spread across the globe. On 27 February 2020, the first person in the Netherlands was diagnosed with COVID-19, and on 23 March 2020, measures were taken by the Rutte III cabinet, which resulted in an ‘intelligent lockdown’, a lighter version of a full lock-down. Since vaccines were not yet available in 2020, the virus had to be controlled by measures taken by the government, such as social distancing, quarantine, isolation, or community containment. 

Models can be very useful in evaluating the effectiveness of these measures and in predicting the expected results of different combinations of interventions. For this purpose, models are needed to simulate the spread of the disease, the interventions a government can take, and the country's response. The risk perceived by the government and subsequent interventions are two steps in the decision-making process of the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). PMT divides the process into two steps: risk assessment (risk perception) and coping appraisal. Based on these two steps, different interventions scenarios can be evaluated.

For the simulation of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands, a pertussis model was converted into a COVID-19 model. In the model, three scenarios were created: the Roadmap scenario, the economic scenario and the age scenario. The Roadmap scenario is based on the “Routekaart” the Dutch government set up to identify when to implement measures. In the economic scenario, the order of measure implementation depends on the economic impact of the measures. And in the age scenario, measures are ordered based on their effect on the number of infections in one of nine age groups and implemented once the number of infected individuals in the different age groups reaches a certain risk level. 
Prior to the creation of the scenarios, the outbreak of COVID-19 in the Netherlands in 2020 is stimulated to test the base model by implementing predefined lockdowns. Eventually, the model is run without any measures, with predefined lockdowns, with the Roadmap scenario, with the economic scenario and with the age scenario.
The model was calibrated using available COVID-19 data, travel data and a survey. The calibration was made challenging since many variables and risk factors are still unknown, undocumented or unspecified. 
According to the model, predefined lockdowns and the three scenarios have a similar effect on the number of infected individuals and hospitalizations. But, by looking at the periods the measures need to be implemented, the age and economic scenario are both more attractive ways to implement measures as the duration of the measures are shorter. In the model, the measures fluctuate a lot, which would mean that the government would need to change the measures every day. This does not seem to be realistic as the changes in measures would work counterproductively, as changing the measures often could cause confusion, dismay and unwillingness among the population. Furthermore, which scenario is better also depends on the priorities of the government in terms of the impact of the measures on the age groups within the Netherlands and economy. 
The model of this thesis contributes to a better understanding of risk perception and coping appraisal of the Dutch government during a pandemic. Even though the model did not possess all initially planned functionalities, a lot of information can be derived on the impact of different measures from the outcomes. Forasmuch as the virus is relatively new, just like the COVID-19 literature itself, research about risk perception and coping appraisal together with the spatial diffusion of the virus is limited. There is thus much potential in future research about risk perception and coping appraisal with a geographical component."
"Land Use and Land Cover Changes in Monduli District, Tanzania: Analysis of multiple classification methods and satellite sensors in order to perform a multi-temporal post-classification change detection analysis in a difficult to map semi-arid savannah landscape","['Rosmalen, R.C. van']","['Zeylmans Van Emmichoven, M.J.']",2021-09-08T18:00:53Z,en,"['LULC change, semi-arid savannah, Landsat, Sentinel, Random Forest, Maximum \nLikelihood, ISODATA']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"In this study Land Use and Cover changes in Monduli district, Tanzania, are analysed from 2019 
to 1985 with the use of a post classification change detection technique. In Monduli there are 
several aspects that complicate the classification of the landscape with remote sensing: A semi-arid climate with wet and dry seasons, similarity of spectral signatures of savannah vegetation 
types, fuzzy transition zones and a small heterogenous agricultural system. As a result of the 
difficulty of the study area for remote sensing previously conducted studies were unable to map 
the surface correctly (van den Bergh, 2016; Verhoeve, 2019). In this study measurements have 
been taken to combat the aforementioned issues and improve the accuracy of the classifications: 
the number of inputs for the classifier from the ground truth dataset has been increased, the 
classifiers are trained on each image separately, accuracies have been calculated for each 
classification, ancillary data and indexes are added and Sentinel 2 imagery (10m spatial resolution)
has been incorporated, next to Landsat imagery (30m spatial resolution). Unsupervised ISODATA 
and supervised maximum likelihood and random forest classification methods have been applied. 
Sentinel did not result in higher accuracies because of the lower number of spectral bands 
available. However, of the random forest classifications with Landsat imagery four classifications 
reached an overall accuracy higher than 0.746 and were used for the change detection analysis.
From 1985 to 2019 classes that increased are agriculture (+2.5%), built environment (+0.3%) 
water (+0.4%) and barren (+1.0%). However, barren shows some fluctuation over the years. As 
a result of the increase of these classes vegetation (woody savannah, savannah, open shrubland, 
closed shrubland and grassland) decreased with 2.7%. Additionally, a decrease in forests of 0.4% 
can be observed which is, next to cloud cover, primarily the result of an increase in woody 
savannah followed by closed shrub and agriculture."
Modelling Wastewater Quantity and Quality in Mexico -- using an agent-based model,"['Chen, Y.']","['Augustijn, Ellen-Wien']",2021-09-08T18:00:56Z,en,"['agent-based modelling (ABM), network-based ABM, wastewater quantity and quality, human water-use activities, Mexico']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"Wastewater is a key element in regional and global water circles, and the discharge of a large quantity of untreated wastewater is posing serious threats to the environment and public health in Mexico. To have a thorough understanding of the mechanism of how wastewater is produced and flows in the city is a crucial step to address the problem. The thesis built a network-based ABM (agent-based model) to simulate the wastewater-related socio-ecological system, taking Huehuetla, Mexico as the study area. It aims to represent the change of wastewater quantity and quality over time and space that is caused by human behaviour, at the hourly temporal resolution.
For this purpose, how local people decide on their activities and how they interact with each other and with the environment are modelled. People’s activities defined here refer to the human water-use practices that could generate wastewater, including individual water-use activities (i.e., the use of bath, wash basin, toilet, and shower) and collectives’ behaviour (i.e., the use of kitchen sink and washing machine, industrial processes, and socio-economic activities). The exact activity adopted by an individual at a certain tick is determined by its own decision-making rule that considers personal characteristics (i.e., age, educational age, water-saving consciousness, and employment status) and exogenous factors, such as weather (i.e., temperature and precipitation) and intervention actions taken by the government (i.e., organise a water-saving campaign). Weather has a direct impact on individual decision-making rules, while the water-saving campaign comes into play by raising individual water-saving awareness that is also influenced by others via the social network. On the other hand, wastewater quality is calculated based on the quantity and concentrations of TSS, BOD5, and COD in wastewater from various sources. Meanwhile, wastewater flow along the sewerage network in the city towards the wastewater treatment plant is simulated mathematically.
The thesis provides an overall picture of the current situation of wastewater production in the study area by plotting the time series of wastewater inflow and quality to the treatment plant, and analyses the main source of wastewater pollutants – industrial processes, and peak hours of household wastewater production – hours near waking-up time and bedtime. Besides, it also shows the role the government plays in controlling wastewater quantity and quality to improve the current wastewater situation. Scenario experiments are conducted in the study area to test the optimal place and timing of a water-saving campaign, with the conclusion being that the campaign held at school in March can lead to the maximum effect on reducing household wastewater production."
Exploring the regional patterns of complex knowledge production: the case of renewable energy technologies in the European Union,"['Vazquez Villegas, O.M.']","['Heimeriks, Gaston', 'Frenken, Koen']",2021-09-08T18:00:54Z,en,['complex knowledge; smart specialisation: renewable energy technologies; path dependency; place dependency; knowledge creation; carbon lock-in; relatedness'],Innovation Sciences,"European regions are currently implementing smart specialisation strategies trough the capitalisation of their knowledge assets to drive innovation in promising sectors, fields or technologies . However, there is a lack of understanding behind the knowledge development process of smart specialisation strategies targeting  renewable energy technologies. Especially so in the creation of complex knowledge, which is more difficult to replicate and it therefore provides a greater competitive advantage. This research aims to fill that gap by exploring the patterns of complex knowledge production in six renewable energy technologies. By making use of quantitative methods and building upon the theoretical foundations of Evolutionary Economic Geography and the Smart Specialisation literature, this research attempts to test the relationship between the ability of a region to create complex knowledge and four mechanisms of path and place dependency linked to the knowledge creation process. Scientific publications cited in patents are used as an indicator for regional knowledge production to capture the role that scientific knowledge plays in technological development. A set of quantitative analysis revealed that scientific relatedness is the most important driver for the creation of complex knowledge. That is the extent to which a region’s scientific profile is related to the knowledge base of a given technology. Contrary to what was expected, the results showed that the infrastructural and technological carbon lock-in of fossil fuel technologies either constraint or encourage the creation of complex knowledge. Moreover, it was found that the ability of a region to create complex knowledge does not depend on its ability to accumulate scientific knowledge, being solar PV technology the exception, possibly due to the high level of analyticity of its knowledge base. Unexpectedly, the access to complementary knowledge trough interregional linkages does not have a strong impact in the creation of complex knowledge. Instead, it is possible that complex knowledge is more likely to be geographically bounded. This is supported by the spatial distribution of complexity scores, in which high-score regions tend to cluster next to each other. To conclude, the findings of this research suggest that European regions implementing smart specialisation strategies targeting renewable energy technologies are more likely to be successful when they diversify into scientific or technological fields that are related to their scientific profile, regardless of their capacity to contribute to the knowledge stock or the knowledge and specialised skills accumulated in fossil fuel technologies."
"Determination of the Influence of Stress, Time and Bedding Orientation on the Evolution of Contact Area and Stress Distribution for Fractures in the Opalinus Clay Shale","['Janssen, O.M.G.']","['Hangx, S.J.T.', 'Zhang, M.']",2021-09-08T18:00:53Z,en,['Opalinus Clay Shale; Carbon Capture Storage; Fracture; Contact Area; Bedding Orientation: Time: Stress'],Earth Structure and Dynamics,"Humanity is facing one of the largest challenges it has come up against in its lifetime, climate change. Emission of greenhouse gasses being the largest contributor to global warming, we need to change our way of living, producing energy and transporting products all over the planet. Emission of greenhouse gasses needs to be kept at a minimum and social change only will probably not be enough. On the short term the so called techno-fixes, where technology comes in play, can help us taking a step towards reaching our mutual goal of reducing CO2 emissions. One of the most promising techno-fixes in play is Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) where CO2 is captured at the source and is geologically stored in empty reservoirs or aquifers where it can be contained for geological timescales. Of course, the storage of CO2 comes with certain risks as parts of this method are still unknown, such as the leakage potential of the in situ caprock. In this study the aim was to obtain empirical relationships for contact area and stress distribution with varying bedding orientation, stress and time for fractures in clayey caprock, in this case the Opalinus Clay shale. By performing compressibility tests with varying bedding orientations, stress and time, using pressure sensitive paper with different stress thresholds, it was observed that; 1. Intact compressibility tests show an increasing matrix compressibility with decreasing bedding orientation; 2. The effect of bedding orientation on the evolution of free space area and >15 MPa-bearing contact area with increasing applied stress shows to be neglectable and therefore empirical relationships were obtained regardless of bedding orientation; 3. Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC) shows increasing trend with increasing bedding orientation angle (0° &lt; θ &lt; 90°); 4. The effect of time is visible in a logarithmic trend, where applied normal stress plays a ~1:1 role; 5. The effect of an applied initial dislocation along the fracture plane shows an increase in contact area with increasing time, which implies there is a strong self-healing property present in the Opalinus Clay shale."

This has been done through a discussion of cisgender-transgender relationships and their existence within broader social norms/normativity, and bringing these in relation to the concepts of identification and disidentification. In order to investigate these dynamics, five couples from the Netherlands were selected of whom one person could be categorised as a transmasculine individual, and one person could be categorised as a cisgender person. Through qualitative interviews, information was gathered surrounding the couples’ relationships, experiences and relations to norms and normativity. Hereby it was found that cisgender-transgender couples relationally constitute and navigate their gender/sex/sexuality, this being both in relation to each other and social norms/normativity, through processes of identification and disidentification. In particular, it has been found that while within the Netherlands labels and categories relating to identity are given much social importance, the couples often actively disidentified with these normative labels and categories. In addition, particular social issues/phenomena were mentioned as being of influence in the construction of norms within the Netherlands that they had to navigate in their gender/sex/sexuality identification and disidentification, namely generational gaps and media representation. Specifically, transnormative media representation and ‘older generations’ were argued to be factors in the hindrance of transgender acceptance and normalisation within society, while social media and ‘younger generations’ were argued to bring about progress herein. These findings contribute to the gaps within existing research that have so far lacked in representing existing relationships between cisgender and transgender people that do not consist of violence and suffering. Furthermore, these findings contribute to the gap in research regarding the concept of the Dutch “hokjesmaatschappij.”"
Analysis of the effect of fluvial and tidal sediment fluxes on bifurcations in river channel networks,"['Jankowski, R.']","['prof dr. S.M. de Jong, dr. ir. J.H.

The shape and pattern of a delta or river network is prone to changes originating from sediment fluxes of fluvial and tidal origin. These changes can be devastating for the 24% of the world population living in delta areas. Quantification of the influence of these fluvial and tidal sediment fluxes on river channel networks is lacking and a global dataset on distributary networks does not yet exist. In this study, the objective is to identify relationships between delta channel networks and fluvial and tidal sediment fluxes for seven deltas around the world. A river network is derived from the JRC Global Water dataset together with the MERIT Hydro dataset available on the Google Earth Engine platform. The network is used to find the number of bifurcations, river outlets and channel lengths. All rivers are placed on a spectrum from highly fluvial dominated to highly tidal dominated and analysed based on the number of bifurcations, river outlets and channel lengths their place on the spectrum. The study finds that terminal channel length decreases with increasing tidal influence which suggests a decrease in number of bifurcations, this is corroborated by literature. This study lays the groundwork for a global understanding of fluvial and tidal influences on delta morphology, however uncertainties lie in the sample size and vector processing. Future research can build on this research by improving the image processing and increasing the number of deltas for a more reliable result."

Imagining these desirable futures has been proven to be difficult: some have argued that we are currently amid a crisis of the imagination. Intriguingly, cultural artefacts could aid in stimulating imaginaries of alternative futures. More specifically, science and climate fiction could be specifically suited for this purpose. The question that was therefore asked in this research is: to what extent can (science) fiction can stimulate policy makers to think of alternative futures? Ten policy makers participated in this study, who used science and climate fiction to create imaginaries of future worlds. Results revealed that most policymakers found that science and climate fiction stimulated them to think of alternative futures. However, most policymakers found that science fiction was not the most useful tool to create imaginaries for a policy setting. Recommendations are therefore made that future thinking is policy settings is stimulated, but that improvement are made for using methods to do this."

In deze tijd waarin de samenleving steeds individualistischer en meer seculier is geworden en alle instituties steeds onder druk zijn komen te staan, is het interessant om te onderzoeken wat de relatie is tussen religie en institutioneel vertrouwen in de wetenschap en hoe verschillende denominaties hierin verschillen. In deze scriptie wordt onderzocht wat de relatie is tussen vertrouwen in de wetenschap en religie en zijn katholieken, protestanten en New Age-aanhangers met elkaar vergeleken. Er is een eerste nulhypothese opgesteld op basis van Durkheim’s anomietheorie waarin er geen verschil werd verwacht tussen de denominaties. Er zijn twee alternatieve hypotheses opgesteld op basis van Durkheim’s sociale integratietheorie waarin wel een verschil wordt verwacht. De tweede hypothese is dat protestanten minder institutioneel vertrouwen hebben in de wetenschap dan katholieken. De derde hypothese is dat New Age-aanhangers het minste institutioneel vertrouwen hebben van alle drie de denominaties. Er zijn ANOVA-analyses uitgevoerd waaruit bleek dat de eerste nulhypothese niet werd ondersteund, de tweede hypothese werd bevestigd en de derde hypothese ook niet wordt ondersteund. Dat de hypothesen niet geheel bevestigd werden heeft wellicht te maken met de versimpelde operationalisering van de complexe concepten ‘New Age-aanhangers’ en ‘mate waarin een waardepatroon collectivistisch is’.

"The Interpretation of Mass Collectives by Dutch Adults
An analysis of native Dutch-speaking adults’ interpretations of mass collectives and the influence of contextual information.","['Aalbers, H.H.']","['Meroni, L.']",2021-09-02T18:00:30Z,en,"['Mass collectives, count nouns, mass nouns, mass-count distinction, collectives']",Linguistics,"The aim of this study is to add to the existing body of research on mass collectives (collectives hereafter). These collectives, such as the English word furniture, are argued to have mass syntax, while semantically allowing a mass reading, an individual reading, or both. Recent studies show that collectives are individual-denoting in a wide range of typologically distinct languages such as English (Barner & Snedeker, 2005), Mandarin Chinese (Lin & Schaeffer, 2018), Hebrew (Hacohen, 2008), and Dutch (Van Witteloostuijn & Schaeffer, 2018). However, these conclusions are questioned by further research based on methodological issues. Huang and Meroni (to appear) suggest that the individual-denoting reading is the most accessible reading of collectives, but not the only possible one. Their research on collectives in Mandarin Chinese shows that manipulating the context and morpho-syntactic information allows participants to give both the individual-denoting and the substance-denoting reading. In the present study, using an online version of the Truth Value Judgment Task, I extend this line of research to a typologically different language, namely Dutch. I investigate if a substance-oriented context can elicit the substance-denoting reading of collectives in native Dutch speaking adults in the same way it does for Mandarin speaking adults and children (Huang & Meroni, to appear). Participants were asked to judge both collectives and count nouns in both substance- and individual-oriented contexts. Results indicate that the substance-oriented context did not elicit a substance-denoting reading of collectives; the difference between the interpretation of collectives in both contexts was not significant. Several potential explanations for these results are discussed as it could be possible that the online setting of the experiment and/or the collectives used for test items made the substance-denoting reading less accessible. Another explanation could be that the mass-count distinction is stronger or different in Mandarin Chinese because of the typological differences between Dutch and Mandarin Chinese. Further research on a language typologically similar to Dutch could shed more light on the results of this experiment."

Using data from the Nationale Veiligheidsmonitor (2017) and data provided by the municipality of Amsterdam and the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics, three hypotheses were tested. Control variables focused on collective efficacy and resource proximity were added to examine whether any effects found for distance could have been influenced by underlying factors.  The results provided no conclusive effect of spatial distance on crime, but rather the significant effects that were found were caused by the variables surrounding collective efficacy and resource proximity. Based on this, further research should take into account characteristics of neighborhood communities and resource proximity within neighborhoods to come to policy implications for communities in disadvantaged neighborhoods and efficient resource allocation to combat crime rates."

Doel: Het doel van deze studie is nagaan of er een verband bestaat tussen cognitieve flexibiliteit en inflectionele morfologie. Bovendien wordt onderzocht of leeftijd en sekse een modererende rol spelen in de mogelijke relatie tussen cognitieve flexibiliteit en inflectionele morfologie. Methode: In dit onderzoek participeerden 105 eentalige Nederlandse kinderen zonder cognitieve problemen in de leeftijd van 60 – 95 maanden. Deze groep bestond uit 51 jongens en 54 meisjes. De testbatterij bestond uit Taaltest Alle Kinderen (TAK), tekentest, WUG en twee subtesten van de WNV-NL (Berko, 1958; Karmiloff-Smith, 1990). Morfologie is getoetst aan de hand van overregularisaties in de TAK en cognitieve flexibiliteit aan de hand van de mate van aanpassingen in tekeningen bij de tekentest. Resultaten: Er werd geen significante relatie gevonden tussen cognitieve flexibiliteit en inflectionele morfologie. Er werd geen moderatie-effect van sekse gevonden. Er werd een moderatie-effect van leeftijd gevonden. Conclusie: De resultaten van het huidige onderzoek geven aanleiding om taalverwerving te zien als een zelf functionerend mechanisme.

expected to continue. As newcomers cannot make up for the higher share of older employees, it 
becomes increasingly important that employees continue working until their retirement age, but
this is not the case. Therefore, the remaining question is how to increase the sustainable 
employability? Theoretical background and empirical findings have shown that optimizing the 
work environment by proactively changing job characteristics could be a promising element in 
job design. This is called job crafting. Research has shown that job crafting may reduce burn-out 
risk and improve work engagement, which indirectly increases sustainable employability. The 
relationship between job crafting and sustainable employability is rarely examined and therefore 
an interesting topic to explore. 
In this study 191 participants were included. All participants were 18 years or older and 
employed when filling in the questionnaire. This study showed that individuals, who crafted 
their job more, were more engaged and had a higher sustainable employability than individuals 
who crafted their job less. No relationship was found between job crafting and burn-out. Finally, 
when examining mediation of the relationship between job crafting and sustainable 
employability by burn-out or work engagement, there was no relationship found. 
This study showed that job crafting could help organisations to increase sustainable 
employability, which is not only good for the organisations, but also for the employees and 
society."

Resulting in a sharp increase in food and drink take-out in the Netherlands. The disposable packaging used for wrapping these products contributes to one of the main issues of the current unsustainable planetary situation: the unprecedented amount of waste produced by consumer societies. Alternatives to disposable packaging are on the rise: reusable packaging networks are emerging on a rapid scale. This research explores the individual acts and practices of sustainable citizenship within reusable food packaging networks. The three chapters of this thesis assess to what extend these practices reflect neoliberal individual responsibility (chapter one) and collective action (chapter two) or political action (chapter three). This case study of the PackBack reusable packaging network illustrates how market-related practices encompass elements of collective and political action that go beyond and even contest neoliberal logic. This study aims to nuance the anthropological critiques on the market and individual practices as sphere for social change through showing the elements of collective and political action which may arise within individual and market-related practices. Simultaneously it highlights the limitations of the market and individual practises as solution to the ecological crisis.

because of its ability to psychologically transport its audience. Two of the most employed 
elements in narrative advertising are humour and the emotion of being moved, which 
respectively provide two forms of well-being: pleasure and meaning or hedonia and 
eudaimonia. This study uses evaluative conditioning to explore the influence of humorous, 
moving or both humorous and moving stories on brand attitude towards commercial brands. 
The experiment (N = 214) used a within-subjects design with four levels (humour, moving, 
humour-moving and neutral) and additionally explored a 2(humour condition: high humour vs 
low humour) x 2(moving condition: high moving vs low moving) design, also within-subjects. 
Brand attitude was measured in likeability, appeal and attractiveness. The results showed that 
stories which contained both humour and the emotion of being moved produced a more positive
brand attitude than humorous or moving stories alone, but that humorous or moving stories 
alone did not produce a more positive brand attitude than neutral stories. It was found that the 
effect of humour and moving stories combined was mainly due to the humour component. It is 
suggested that adding the moving element was needed in order to provide a proposed contrast 
effect between the two. These results suggest that marketeers should employ humorous 
narratives with moving elements in their marketing techniques in order to gain in brand attitude.
The findings provide guidance for marketeers in the commercial spheres on how to improve 
their marketing strategies."

Culture-related differences of grief experiences have become crucial in the bereavement literature of the past decades. Objective. Self-blame, saying farewell, and attending the funeral were hypothesized to serve as predictors of grief responses to a significant loss. The present study investigated and compared these variables on the cultural dimension of masculinity and aimed determining accordingly the role of funeral in farewell. Sample. A non-clinical sample of 372 participants from Brazil, Bulgaria, Germany, and Sri Lanka was divided into three categories representing a low (N = 41), medium (N = 175), and high masculinity level (N = 156). Method. The recruitment was conducted through an online questionnaire with items adapted from the Inventory of Complicated Grief, Grief Cognitions Questionnaire, Bereavement Guilts Scale, and new generated ones. Results. Bereaved who said farewell showed less self-blame than their counterparts. Despite higher levels of self-blame were associated to higher grief intensity, masculinity did not moderate their relationship. Self-blame was a significant grief predictor only in societies with a medium masculinity level. Unaccomplished farewell and funeral attendance were associated to higher grief intensity. Lastly, the findings indicated a significant relationship between masculinity and funeral’s role in farewell with a tendency of considering funeral a cognitive goodbye the higher the masculinity level. Conclusion. Results suggested that self-blame, farewell, funeral attendance were relevant grief predictors which differed accordingly the masculinity level. They additionally delivered further reasons to assume that farewell could include a cognitive and an emotional component."

The interviews were transcribed using Automatic Speech Recognition technology, and analyzed using a keyword-based approach using the Dutch LIWC2007 and LiLaH emotion lexicon. The objective of this research was to examine gender differences in the use of emotional language, and to see whether these differences fell in line with gender norms for emotional expression. It was found that women used more words related to joy, friends and humans, whereas men used more swear words and words describing positions in space. The results show that emotional gender stereotypes are slightly present in the language of this dataset."

Future scenarios to introduce sustainability-related SocioScientific Issues in science education,"['Esmeijer, L.M.']","['Knippels, Dr. MCPJ', 'Van Harskamp, M.']",2021-09-08T18:01:58Z,en,"['Scientific literacy, Citizenship education, Socio-Scientific Issues, Sustainability\neducation, Future thinking, Future scenarios']",Science Education and Communication,"This study explored the design and educational potential of six future scenarios for introducing sustainability-related Socio-Scientific Issues (SSIs) in secondary science education. It is an important aim in science education to have the competence to deal with these issues as a thoughtful citizen, described as a component of scientific literacy. SSIs are controversial issues that have no clear-cut answers and include scientific, societal, and personal elements. Therefore, well-informed opinion-forming and decision-making on both the scientific and the social aspect and thinking about future possibilities is required when dealing with these issues as a thoughtful citizen. Introducing sustainability-related SSIs in the classroom is challenging because of their interdisciplinary and complex content and their future character that is often being experienced as abstract and difficult to comprehend. Presenting them in a narrative way using future scenarios can provide a concrete and realistic view of an SSI and connect the complex content and future character to students’ daily lives. This can evoke students’ engagement and motivation, stimulate future thinking about sustainability on a deeper level, and encourage students to ask questions and explore their own and others’ emotions and values required to negotiate these SSIs. Six future scenarios were designed based on criteria derived from literature. They covered different themes such as energy policy, biodiversity, and food production. The scenarios were read by Dutch lower secondary high school students (N=24, 11 females, 13 males; average age 12.3 years old), and they were interviewed both individually and in focus groups (12 individual interviews and three focus groups of four students) to explore their reactions to the scenarios. Participants’ reactions to the scenarios were analysed by distinguishing questions, emotions, values, and types of reasoning. Findings show an educational potential for all six future scenarios to introduce sustainability-related SSIs in science education, for they evoked questions, emotions, values, and reasoning among the participants, required for opinionforming and decision-making when negotiating these issues. It is recommended to carefully select one scenario or to combine two or more scenarios for further research on the development of teaching and learning methods for implementing future scenarios in education."
Infrared thermography to detect intramammary infections at drying off,"['Bruggink, T.']","['Lam, T.J.G.M.']",2021-09-08T18:02:10Z,en,['Mastitis; Drying off treatment; Subclinical mastitis; Infrared thermography; Quarter temperature'],Geneeskunde van gezelschapsdieren,"Mastitis is one of the most common problems in the dairy industry and is responsible for large economic losses. Mastitis is mainly caused by bacterial intramammary infections (IMI). During the dry period, especially at the start and the end of that period, mammary glands are susceptible to the invasion of udder pathogens. IMI gained during the dry period is a risk factor for the development of clinical mastitis after calving. Antibiotic treatment at drying off has a dual target: cure existing IMI and prevention of new IMI during the dry period. Currently, decisions about the dry off treatment are usually based on cow level diagnostics. To optimize antimicrobial use in dry cow treatments, a next step may be to make dry cow treatment decisions at quarter level rather than on cow level. Infrared thermography (IRT) is a simple, effective and non-invasive method that detects surface heat. In experimental settings it has been shown to be effective in diagnosing clinical mastitis. To determine if IRT is able to diagnose subclinical mastitis at drying off, a total of 53 dairy cows from 3 different dairy farms have been photographed. Somatic cell count (SCC) on cow level, on quarter level and a bacterial culture at quarter level were used to determine if IRT could be useful as a quarter level diagnostic on top of SCC on cow level to diagnose subclinical mastitis.
The mean quarter temperature measured at a distance of 1 meter varied between 26°C and 36.8°C. The maximum quarter temperature varied between 29.2°C and 43.3. There is no significant association between the SCC on quarter level and the mean and maximum quarter temperature. No significant association was found between the presence of an IMI and the mean and maximum quarter temperature. Quarters with a major pathogen IMI, which could benefit from antibiotic treatment at drying off, were considered to have subclinical mastitis. No association was found between the presence of subclinical mastitis and the mean and maximum quarter temperature.
The IRT pictures were taken the day after drying off. To check if a difference in quarter temperature occurred between the day of drying off and the day after, a total of 13 dairy cows were photographed using the IRT camera. There is a significant association between the quarter temperature measured at day 1 or day 2 if the environmental temperature is placed in the model (p &lt; 0.05). This means no difference was found between the temperatures measured on day 1 and day 2. Altogether, these findings suggest that IRT is not able to diagnose subclinical mastitis and can not be used as a quarter level diagnostics method to determine dry off treatment."

Er is een antwoord geformuleerd op de hoofdvraag doormiddel van een kwalitatief onderzoek waarbij gebruik is gemaakt van semigestructureerde interviews en een focusgroep. Hieruit komt naar voren dat de wil om het aardrijkskundeonderwijs te dekoloniseren aanwezig is onder de respondenten. De respondenten willen leerlingen meerdere perspectieven meegeven en hen leren om een kritische houding aan te nemen ten opzichte van koloniale kennis. Leerlingen moeten meekrijgen dat kennis en het onderwijs niet neutraal zijn. De respondenten vinden het echter nog lastig om hun lessen te dekoloniseren en om te bepalen welke competenties hiervoor nodig zijn. Om te zorgen dat docenten hier concreter mee aan de slag kunnen, moet de discussie over de dekolonisatie van het aardrijkskundeonderwijs gestart worden. Er is behoefte aan hulp van organisaties buiten het aardrijkskundeonderwijs die gespecialiseerd zijn in dekolonisatie om een dekolonisatieproces in gang te zetten, aangezien aardrijkskundigen nog veel blinde vlekken hebben en een westers perspectief hanteren. Hulp moet echter niet gezien worden als de oplossing, maar als een manier om richting te geven aan een dekolonisatieproces. De verantwoordelijkheid hiervoor ligt bij de aardrijkskundige gemeenschap zelf. Tot slot moeten het KNAG en alle lerarenopleidingen aandacht besteden aan dit onderwerp en moet dekolonisatie verwerkt worden in leidende documenten zoals het curriculum. Zo worden lesmethodes en docenten aangemoedigd om het aardrijkskundeonderwijs te dekoloniseren."

The first part of this research aims at determining how students are selected for the second round and at proposing an inclusive selection method. Results show that selecting the best scoring boy and girl from every participating classroom leads to the most gender equal pool of participants for the second round. The second part aims at understanding the differences in motivation, perception of the Physics Olympiad and personality traits between male and female participants. This is done by sending a questionnaire to past participants of the Junior Physics Olympiad. 49 participants completed the questionnaire, revealing that boys and girls have different reasons for participating, more girls doing it for fun and more boys doing it for a chance to win. Results also show that girls have a lower sense of self-efficacy than boys, which may explain their lower performance in the Physics Olympiad. Suggestions are made to encourage girls more and help them improve their self-efficacy and self-confidence."

This threatens the proper functioning of ecosystems and ultimately human existence itself. Food production is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss. As cities accommodate the majority of the world population and thus constitute centres of resource consumption, the urban food system is a potential point of intervention to address the global biodiversity challenge. So far, answers to the question which role cities can play in the solution to halt biodiversity loss beyond their own jurisdictional boundaries are limited. To understand how cities can become active players in the global biodiversity challenge, this research explores urban food governance in relation to urban, regional, and global biodiversity. Based on the discourse coalition approach, it examines eleven urban food strategies (UFSs) from cities that are members of the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact. The analysis results in four problem frames that the UFSs make use of: a productionist frame, a dietary change frame, a resource efficiency frame, and a welfare frame. While all UFSs use these four frames, they tell different storylines to interpret and connect them with each other. For a smaller sample of three cities – Cologne, Copenhagen, and London – I conducted an in-depth analysis of urban food governance instruments in place in the cities that have a direct or indirect effect on biodiversity either in or outside of the city. In the context of the different problem frames and storylines in urban food governance, four main findings emerge. (1) Cities have a strong public health mandate and most of the UFSs emphasise the importance of a healthy diet. Accelerating the protein transition (reducing the amount of animal proteins in our diets) offers potential for synergies between biodiversity conservation and health. (2) Many cities are in favour of a stronger regionalisation of their food system, however, as scientific evidence of environmental benefits of local and regional food is thin, regional food should always be coupled with other characteristics, like seasonal food production or environmental criteria such as organic agriculture. (3) Cities should incorporate food more strongly into their work on the circular economy to diversify instruments tackling food waste. Lastly, (4) urban agriculture offers a lot of opportunities for citizens: It offers room for education, relaxation, and community building. Cities that see urban agriculture primarily as a means for local food production, should also recognise these social benefits. The results show that except for urban agriculture, these instruments address regional and global biodiversity loss. This confirms the potential of cities to become transformative actors in the global biodiversity challenge and the importance of further research on this topic."

Research shows that teachers use more controlling than autonomy supportive strategies when they consider their students to be at-risk. It is unknown whether this also applies to SEN students. The question arises which need supportive (i.e., autonomy supportive and structure) strategies teachers use when teaching SEN students. By means of semi-structured interviews, the present explorative, qualitative study aims to gain more insight in the strategies teachers (N =11) use when teaching SEN students in both special and regular primary education and what teachers’ underlying considerations are when deploying these strategies.

"Students’ and Teachers’ Perceptions on Formative Assessment

Formative assessment and teacher feedback are both 
considered important in higher education. The formative 
assessment cycle facilitates implementing formative 
assessment, but teachers struggle with the fifth step in which 
follow-up actions lead to adaption in education and learning 
(Gulikers & Baartman, 2017). Comparative studies to 
students' and teachers' perceptions seem rare. This study 
compared perceptions of both on formative assessment 
strategies (Black & Wiliam, 2009, 2018) and teachers' 
feedback. In total 748 students (Mage = 21.52, SDage = 
2.18, age range: 17-39) and 75 teachers (Mage = 
45.97, SDage = 10.16, range = 26-64) of the Dutch 
Associate degree faculty of Avans University of Applied 
Sciences participated. The study found no significant 
differences in perceptions on formative assessment 
strategies but found significant differences in teachers' 
feedback. Teachers' scored higher in their perceptions of 
teachers' feedback than students. Sharing learning goals and 
criteria for success, expectations and the division of roles 
between the student, peers, and teachers, and how to value 
and process feedback seemed the most important 
differences. To conclude, the gap in perceptions needs to

Previous studies on monodisciplinary teams indicate that guided reflection interventions may improve team processes and team effectiveness, yet research in multidisciplinary student teams is scarce. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of team reflection interventions on multidisciplinary student team effectiveness and team processes. This study is quasi-experimental. Teams participating in the team reflection intervention were expected to demonstrate higher team effectiveness and more and qualitatively better team processes than teams that did not participate. This expectation was investigated with non-participating structured observations and a questionnaire with a sample of 22 students from a Bachelor’s program at a Dutch university. The findings of this study do not align with the expected results, for several possible reasons. This study shows that students find reflection interventions useful when there are problems in the team. Further longitudinal research is needed to investigate how reflection interventions can be effectively used in multidisciplinary student teams to improve teamwork. This study developed an observation schedule that is applicable for further research on student team processes."
"Learners’ Preference for Reference Frame Before, During, and After Task Performance","['Tuin, K.']","['E.M. Janssen, L.

Learning environments need to offer support to help them with this. In immersive learning environments (ILEs), learning analytics are available that could provide such support by means of learning analytic dashboards (LADs). With LADs, learning analytics (LA) can be visualized and support SRL skills before, during, and after task performance. However, this will only happen if learners appreciate the LA visualizations on their dashboards. Therefore this study focuses on the preferences learners have for LADs used before, during, and after task performance that use a specific means to present LA, namely reference frames. Reference frames provide an anchor point for comparing learning analytics that could help learners evaluate their learning. Three different types of reference frames were used: the social reference frame, the progress reference frame, and the achievement reference frame. This research showed that regardless of timing (i.e., before, during, or after task performance), learners have a preference for LADs with a progress reference frame. This insight can contribute to the design of LADs in ILEs that learners appreciate and potentially support them in regulating their learning."

Analyzing the discourse of Girls Who Code concerning gender inequality,"['Smits, Z.']","['van Schie, G.']",2021-09-03T18:00:18Z,en,"['discourse, CDA, feminism, gender, gender gap, STEM, toxic masculinity, toxic tech culture,']",New Media and Digital Culture,"STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields currently face a significant gender gap. As it is widely recognized that the shortage of women is caused by lack of access and lack of an inclusive culture, multiple initiatives emerged that focus on getting more women into STEM fields. However, some of these initiatives received criticism for the fact that education for women is not a fitting approach, as it is STEM culture itself that needs revision. This thesis aims to expose how the initiative Girls Who Code (GWC) constructs this gender inequality problem in the discourse of their website and Instagram platform. Specifically, it investigates whether this discourse aligns with the actual problems of the gender gap in the STEM sector. Here, discourse is the way a topic is talked about that holds certain implications or power structures. I conducted a critical discourse analysis in order to place the discourse of the GWC website and Instagram in the current social and political context of gender inequality. The analysis showed how their Instagram is pointing explicitly the toxic masculinity in tech culture, while the website is more nuanced. Also, the gender-specific approach of GWC might not be the appropriate solution to fixing the gender gap. Overall, I conclude that the discourse of GWC indicates that GWC is maintaining the exact culture it is trying to improve, by focusing on fixing women instead of fixing the system itself i.e. the toxic traits of tech culture."

Daarom is het eerste doel van dit onderzoek om te achterhalen wat de gevolgen zijn van werk-FoMo op werktevredenheid, werkprestatie, burn-out en bevlogenheid. Het tweede doel van het onderzoek is om te onderzoeken in welke mate maximizers werk-FoMo ervaren. Het derde doel van het onderzoek is om te onderzoeken of de mate van maximizen gevolgen heeft voor de mate waarin individuen werkuitkomsten ervaren. Om antwoord te geven op de onderzoeksvragen is er een kwantitatieve data-analyse uitgevoerd. 156 participanten hebben de vragenlijst ingevuld. Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat een hoge mate van werk-FoMo positief samenhangt met burn-out. Ook is ondervonden dat een hoge mate van maximizen positief samenhangt met werk-FoMo en burn-out. Daarnaast is uit het onderzoek gebleken dat naarmate individuen hoger scoren op resolute maximizen zij minder werktevredenheid ervaren als gevolg van werk-FoMo. Deze inzichten bieden fundatie voor vervolgonderzoek. Het doel hiervan is inzichten te winnen voor een passende en werkende preventie gericht op het verminderen van burn-out onder werknemers.

Hierbij wordt eveneens gekeken, door middel van het Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model, naar aspecten van de werkomgeving. Ook wel de modererende rol van leidinggevende ondersteuning, collega ondersteuning en werkdruk op de veronderstelde relatie. Meer inzicht hierin kan helpen om het hoge verloop waar de zorgsector mee kampt tegen te gaan en de werkdruk te verminderen.
Methode – De analyse is gebaseerd op een steekproef van 553 zorgmedewerkers (verpleegkundigen, verzorgenden en helpenden) uit de Nederlandse sector zorg en welzijn. De opgestelde hypotheses zijn getest door middel van regressieanalyses.
Resultaten – De interne gepercipieerde inzetbaarheid hangt negatief samen met de vertrekintentie. De externe gepercipieerde inzetbaarheid heeft geen significante relatie met de vertrekintentie. Daarnaast is er sprake van partiële mediatie door IPE op de relatie van zowel beide vormen van leidinggevende ondersteuning als collega ondersteuning op de vertrekintentie. Partiële mediatie omdat het zowel om een indirect als een direct effect betreft naar de vertrekintentie. Werkdruk is tot slot positief gerelateerd aan de vertrekintentie.
Conclusie – De conclusie die getrokken kan worden is dat de gepercipieerde inzetbaarheid de vertrekintentie van zorgmedewerkers verlaagt. IPE had hierbij een negatief effect en EPE had hierbij geen significant effect wat betekent dat organisaties niet direct hoeven te vrezen voor een verloop wanneer medewerkers elders meer kansen waarnemen. Daarnaast wordt de gepercipieerde inzetbaarheid gestimuleerd door zowel ondersteuning van leidinggevende als van collega’s. Deze zogenaamde job resources werken hiermee motiverend en werken via de interne gepercipieerde inzetbaarheid indirect door op vertrekintentie. Het effect van deze job resources op vertrekintentie verloopt echter ook op andere manieren, niet via de interne gepercipieerde inzetbaarheid, getuige het directe effect dat is gevonden in dit onderzoek.

Dit onderzoek biedt inzichten in de impact van COVID-19 op autogebruik en -bezit in grootstedelijke context en welke invloed persoonlijke kenmerken, thuiswerken, perceptie van besmettingsgevaar en veranderende attitudes hierop hebben. Om dit te onderzoeken is een enquête uitgezet onder 500 respondenten uit de vijf grootste steden van Nederland. Uit de enquêteresultaten blijkt dat de vervoerwijzekeuze van de respondenten is veranderd sinds de coronacrisis, dat de verwachting is dat er een stuk meer thuisgewerkt gaat worden na de crisis en dat er meer auto’s zijn gekocht dan dat er verkocht zijn. De respondenten geven aan het openbaar vervoer tijdens de coronacrisis minder te gebruiken voor woon-werk verkeer en sociaal-recreatief verkeer. Daarnaast verwachten zij het openbaar vervoer ook na afloop van de coronamaatregelen minder te gebruiken. De auto is door de respondenten tijdens de coronacrisis enigszins in mindere mate gekozen als vervoermiddel, maar er is geen groot verschil te vinden tussen de periode vóór corona en de verwachting na afloop van de coronamaatregelen. Na afloop van de coronamaatregelen verwachten de respondenten de auto iets minder voor woon-werk verkeer te gebruiken en iets meer voor sociaal-recreatief verkeer, in vergelijking met de situatie vóór de coronamaatregelen. Hoe bang iemand is om besmet te raken in het openbaar vervoer heeft een positieve invloed op de verwachting om meer met de auto te reizen na afloop van de coronamaatregelen. Daarnaast zijn er meer auto’s gekocht dan dat er verkocht zijn door de responsgroep en na regressie analyses blijkt dat leeftijd, inkomen, de angst voor besmetting en thuiswerken invloed hebben gehad op het wel of niet gekocht hebben van een extra auto tijdens de coronacrisis. De responsgroep was niet representatief voor de bevolking van de vijf grootste steden van Nederland en hier moet rekening mee gehouden worden bij interpretatie van de resultaten."
A Comparative Study on Hydrogen Production and Storage Using an Offshore Wind Farm in The Netherlands.,"['Walavalkar, A.C.']","['Gibescu, M.']",2021-09-02T18:00:11Z,en,[],Energy Science,"Producing energy with conventional resources like coal, oil, and gas has come under a lot of scrutiny and criticism because of the greenhouse gas that they emit while producing energy. One of the most hazardous ways of producing Hydrogen is by using natural gas. In this process, extreme amounts of carbon dioxide are released. Countries all around the world are pushing for the production of energy using renewable resources. Energy can be easily produced by using non-conventional resources but storing that energy for future purposes poses a challenge as it has to be sent to the electrical grid or stored in batteries. Hydrogen, in that case, proves to be beneficial as it can be stored for comparatively longer durations and as and when required it can be used for combustion, heat generation, and chemical industry. The focus of this research is to analyse the combination of the wind farm, electrolyser, and hydrogen storage which results in the lowest LCOH and LCOS, and the sensitive factors that affect the LCOH result in the most.
One of the preferred processes for electrolysis is the Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) process due to its intermittent nature in the balancing of renewable energy sources that makes it alluring for industrial applications. As hydrogen production on offshore as well as onshore is the first part then now storage of the hydrogen produced is the second part of this research. The ways to store hydrogen which are considered in this study are pressurised tanks and underground caverns. By far, storing hydrogen in underground caverns has proven to be advantageous worldwide. In this study, three different scenarios for production and storage of hydrogen are created namely On-Site Centralized Electrolyser with onshore storage, Off-site Electrolyser with onshore storage, and On-Site Distributed Electrolyser with onshore storage. Comparisons are made between these three scenarios based on various parameters like CAPEX, OPEX, increase in cost with distance, and amount of hydrogen produced. By using these parameters, the LCOH is calculated. After developing a base model for all three scenarios, the scenario with the most cost-effective and practical solution is chosen. This scenario is then subjected to a sensitivity analysis wherein various parameters under consideration are subject to varying load conditions. Sensitivity analysis is necessary to be performed as the supply and production of hydrogen will never be uniform at all times and the chosen system must be able to handle different kinds of situations such as more losses in conversion or transmission, the electrolyser efficiency, and the amount of water needed to ensure optimal performance throughout its commissioned life. Results are drawn from this analysis and a conclusion regarding the best-case scenario for the hydrogen-producing offshore wind farm has been made."
The contribution of patenting to a circular economy: How patents on waste management influence resource efficiency and waste reduction,"['Zwart, R. de']","['Rainville, A.']",2021-09-02T18:00:13Z,en,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The concept of circular economy is one of the main solutions to achieve a sustainable future. However, while most countries have taken steps towards a circular economy, more progress needs to be made. Patenting activities on waste management technologies show promise to contribute to the transition towards a circular economy since patents indicate innovating and sharing knowledge. Therefore the contribution of patenting to circular economy progress needed to be analysed. To achieve this, this research has answered the research question: How does patenting in waste management contribute towards circular economy progress? This question is answered by comparing patent data to circular economy indicators resource efficiency and waste reduction. Within the patent data, a distinguishing between patent count, radicalness and technical relevance of patents on waste management is made. Correlation and regression analyses are used to find a relation between the patent data and circular economy indicators. Results indicate, however, that on a global scale patents currently do not lead to circular economy progress. However, evidence has been found that under the right circumstances patents can contribute. In this case, patents protecting radically new technologies conduce more than patents protecting incremental innovation. Based on the findings useful policy recommendations, such as a focus on collaboration and patenting strategies, are provided to governments to reach the circumstances in which the current patenting activities will contribute in transitioning to a circular economy."
An approach for developing exnovation policy for sustainability missions - Breaking away from path-dependencies in the Dutch agri-food sector,"['Onrust, M.P.A.']","['Moors, E.H.M.', 'van Oers, L.M.']",2021-09-02T18:00:14Z,en_US,"['exnovation policy, exnovation policy instruments, path-dependencies, policy making approach, sustainability missions.']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"To tackle complex societal challenges such as sustainability transitions policy makers put attention to mission approaches. Thereby, the typical focus on innovation policy does not suffice in tackling sustainability transitions. Exnovation policy is seen as an essential addition to accelerate transition processes and ensure sustainability missions are timely realized. Exnovation entails the deliberate exit from non-sustainable institutions, (infra)structures, technologies, products and practices (Heyen et al., 2017). However, there is a lack in a practical approach that can guide policy makers in developing exnovation policy for accomplishing sustainability missions.
This research aimed to address this gap by developing a practical stepwise approach for exnovation policy making to support sustainability missions and by empirically grounding it in policy for the mission of sustainable soil management in 2030 in the Dutch agricultural sector. In doing so, this research linked literature on path-dependency and literature on exnovation. To design exnovation policy effectively it is required to understand 1) how path-dependencies hamper transition processes and 2) what exnovation instruments could be used to break away from different types of path-dependencies and as such support sustainability missions. This research used qualitative data retrieved through desk research, interviews and exploratory workshops. 
Results show that the different types of identified path-dependencies regarding soil management in Dutch agriculture were material, cognitive, financial, and regulative path-dependency. These could be targeted and broken away from using different types of exnovation instruments, namely, economic, regulatory, informational, and socioeconomic instruments. Overall, findings show that exnovation policy to support sustainability missions could be effectively designed following our stepwise approach consisting of five consecutive steps. This research contributed to the theoretical field of missions and sustainability transitions by demonstrating the value of taking path-dependencies as an analytical lens and starting point for developing exnovation policy. Further, the practical stepwise approach provided fruitful insights into policy design for transitions and sustainability missions."

All over the world, deltas are popular settlements, due to their fertile soils which support intensive agriculture and expanding cities. However, deltas belong to the most vulnerable coastal environments and currently face multiple environmental and climatic threats. The increasing pressure of expanding populations and intensifying climate risks in deltas, stimulated the exchange of knowledge about climate change adaptation and water management solutions on a global level. The Netherlands actively promotes their Delta planning knowledge, as they have a long experience of living with water and in a delta. This process of sharing knowledge between countries is also known as policy translation. This study explores the success factors for Dutch actors in policy translation. The object of translation is the policy model known as the Dutch Delta Approach (DDA). In this thesis, the international collaboration between the Netherlands and Vietnam and the creation of the Mekong Delta Plan (MDP) is considered as a prime example of policy translation. By conducting fourteen in-depth interviews and analyzing seven policy documents, the policy translation process is dissected and challenges and success factors are identified. The results show that the translation was partly successful, in terms of programmatic success and policy success. Additionally, the factors contributing to the success are identified: actor relations, conveying ability and ability to change the policy process. Moreover, by conducting the in-depth interviews, an additional success factor is identified: ownership."
"Garment Workers’ Ability to Benefit from Digitalization of the Fashion Value Chain
Exploring how digitalization of the fashion value chain affects garment workers in the global south","['Boumans, T.']","['Leung, M.']",2021-09-02T18:00:16Z,en_US,"['digitalization, fashion value chain, social sustainability, garment workers in the global south, access to labor rights']",Sustainable Development,"Whilst sustainability challenges are becoming increasingly urgent matters on global development agendas, societies have entered the ‘digital age’. Unsurprisingly, along the lines of the current zeitgeist technologies are often put forward as a solution to development issues. Nevertheless, in many cases it remains unclear to what extent digitalization can actually solve societies’ problems. Especially when it comes to the social consequences of technological interventions, a significant academic knowledge gap prevails.

In this research, the relationship between digitalization and social sustainability outcomes is explored by zooming in on the global fashion value chain. In recent years, technologies like 3D software, RFID tags, AVR, blockchain, and AI are changing the processes of the global fashion value chain. At the same time, the sector is notorious for its persistent substandard working conditions, especially for garment workers in the global south. Whilst social sustainability issues are a clear challenge for the sector, thus far there is little insight into how digitalization processes are affecting garment workers in the global south.

Based on theories of access, the main concern of this research is how digitalization affects the ability of garment workers in the global south to access their international workers’ rights. To understand this effect, first the modus operandi of the fashion value chain is set out. Second, the status-quo context of garment workers is elaborated on. Additionally, the main digitalization activities in the fashion value chain are outlined. Ultimately, through an analysis of existing data and supplementary in-depth interviews with industry actors, this research formulates four constructs through which digitalization of the fashion value chain affects garment workers: making fast fashion faster, transparency and traceability, automation and reshoring, and data privacy and ownership. 

Although the results show that these constructs allow room for both positive and harmful outcomes for garment workers, based on current exploitative system dynamics disadvantageous outcomes for garment workers are most likely to dominate. However, this can be circumvented. For one through additional knowledge creation, and subsequently through informed decision making from industry actors and governments that is respectful to the value of garment workers in the global south."
"Don’t Sweat It, Be Bold: Neoliberal Discourses in Progressive Advertising Campaigns","['Verberne, L.']","['Candidatu, L.']",2021-09-07T18:00:56Z,en,"['neoliberalism, homonormativity, advertising, inequality']",Taal- en cultuurstudies,"Media that aim to empower marginalised communities are gaining popularity in popular culture, especially in advertising. Leftist scholars have noted that these texts often combine discourses from feminist and queer activism with neoliberal values, manifested in discourses that are called neoliberal feminism, popular feminism and homonormativity. Using these three discourses as analytical concepts, I investigate two progressive advertising campaigns that are part of a larger trend of empowering media: ALL STRENGTH, NO SWEAT by deodorant brand Secret and Levi’s PRIDE: 2018. I examine how the two campaigns make use of progressive values used in feminist and queer activist discourses and compare them. To do this, I perform a Foucauldian discourse analysis. Because discourse is a way of representing a certain version of reality, I pay special attention to other interpretations of reality that were hidden in the campaigns. The analysis is structured around three key themes: the construction of social inequality, the subjects who are (not) represented and the presence of the brands and their products in the advertisements.
I argue that the two campaigns are remarkably similar in their representation of queer and feminist issues and subjects because they both incorporate neoliberal discourses. In the Levi’s campaign, this manifests as a homonormative discourse, while Secret mirrors popular and neoliberal feminist discourses. Both campaigns make visible subjects who, despite obstacles, have succeeded in their respective work fields. Social inequality is thus represented as a personal problem that an individual is capable of overcoming if they have internalised neoliberal values of responsibility, consumerism and entrepreneurialism. In other words, the campaigns perpetuate the idea that individual responsibility is a sufficient solution to structural issues of queerphobia and sexism. This way, the advertisements dismiss the structural and intersectional nature of many issues, placing the onus of empowerment on individuals. Moreover, they encourage the viewer to become responsible neoliberal workers and citizens, presenting queer people and/or women with a new set of norms rather than liberating them from social constraints. All in all, the brands offer the viewer a simplified and palatable portrayal of inequality that is insufficient to critique structural socio-economic issues. The seemingly progressive narrative of the campaigns is very useful for the brands, however. By making these advertisements, they associate their products with the empowerment of marginalised communities. In summary, the thesis aims to show that the campaigns ultimately do not liberate marginalised communities but further neoliberal agendas and serve the progressive reputations of the brands."

In dit onderzoek analyseer ik hoe kijkers reageren op TIGER KING: MURDER, MAYHEM AND MADNESS door een discoursanalyse uit te voeren over publieksreacties op de serie op het social mediaplatform Reddit. Hierbij volg ik de analysemethode voor genreonderzoek van Jason Mittell om te kijken hoe dit discours de true crime documentary definieert, evalueert en interpreteert. Kijkers definiëren de serie als een documentaire, een label dat niet overeenkomt met het true crime documentary-label dat de serie van Netflix krijgt. Niet alleen variëren de interpretaties van kijkers over de serie, zoals ook blijkt uit eerder onderzoek naar het genre true crime documentary, maar ook de evaluaties van de serie zijn niet eenduidig. Ik concludeer dat het genre van de serie mede gevormd wordt door de discursieve praktijken van kijkers via reacties op Reddit en niet alleen door tekstuele kenmerken. Deze publieksparticipatie is niet gedecentraliseerd en oppervlakkig, maar kijkers verruimen de betekenissen en waarden van de serie door in te gaan op maatschappelijke onderwerpen. Dit toont het belang van Mittell’s benadering van genreonderzoek, namelijk dat een genre gevormd wordt door definities, evaluaties en interpretaties van meerdere discoursen. Verder gaan kijkers in hun definities, evaluaties en interpretaties niet alleen in op de serie zelf en de vele onderwerpen die aan bod komen, maar ook op de rol van de documentairemakers bij het vormen van het narratief en representaties van personages. Waar de focus in het debat rondom true crime documentaries voornamelijk ligt op de relatie tussen interpretaties van kijkers en rechtszaken, vult dit onderzoek het debat aan doordat veel reacties ook gericht zijn op de productie van de true crime documentary TIGER KING: MURDER, MAYHEM AND MADNESS."

The United States played a central role in this campaign by covertly facilitating military training, financial help and communication services to the regimes in the context of the Cold War. Despite supporting these gross human rights violations, the 1970s were also a turning point for American foreign policy as human rights were considered increasingly important. This thesis elaborates on this complex relationship between national security and human rights during the Ford administration (1974 – 1977) by analysing the influence of the foreign policy decision-making process. This process has been analysed both at the level of the state, using the rational actor model (RAM), as well as at the level of key individuals using the bureaucratic politics model (BPM). In contrast to existing literature, these models have not been considered as opposites but as complementary. This approach differs fundamentally on three points from previous research: (1) the focus on the underlying process of foreign policy instead of the outcome, (2) its influence on the changing relationship between national security and human rights, and (3) by an analysis of new key actors and primary resources."

Deze werd beïnvloed door onder andere de vertaling van Aristoteles’ zoölogische werken door Michael Scotus (De animalibus, ca. 1220), waardoor Aristoteles’ ideeën herontdekt werden. Het Liber de natura rerum (ca. 1245) van Thomas van Cantimpré kwam uit deze ontwikkeling voort. Deze Latijnse bron werd door Jacob van Maerlant in het Middelnederlands bewerkt: Der Naturen Bloeme (ca. 1270). De ‘animal turn’ is in deze bronnen in verschillende aspecten terug te zien, zoals bijvoorbeeld in de grote hoeveelheid onderwerpen, het systematisch ordenen van deze onderwerpen in ‘boeken’ en de grote hoeveelheid informatie over de onderwerpen zelf. In dit werkstuk is deze verwetenschappelijking na de dertiende eeuw bekeken aan de hand van een casusonderzoek naar de tekst en afbeeldingen van drie hybride zeemonsters in geïllustreerde kopieën van Maerlants tekst, die in de dertiende, veertiende en vijftiende eeuw in de Lage Landen vervaardigd werden. 
	De inhoudelijke informatie verandert in de Der Naturen Bloeme-kopieën weinig. Op tekstueel vlak bestaan enkele varianten, waaraan een gezamenlijke legger voor de Leidse, Berlijns-Weense en Bremense handschriften te herkennen valt. Bij de afbeeldingen is een verandering zichtbaar bij de zeemonnik en zeeridder in de latere handschriften, maar ook dit zou op de gezamenlijke legger terug kunnen gaan. Het gebrek aan eigentijds iconografisch vergelijkingsmateriaal bij de zeemonnik en zeeridder en de overeenkomsten tussen de zeemeerminnen in de handschriften maken het waarschijnlijk dat de beeldtaal van deze twee wezens is afgeleid van de zeemeermin. 
	De ‘verwetenschappelijking’ is in de Der Naturen Bloeme-kopieën niet aan de hand van de tekst en afbeeldingen terug te zien. Dit betekent echter niet dat deze ontwikkeling niet bestond."

Zo is er een wereldwijde beweging opgestart rond ‘Black Lives Matter’, die op 20 juni 2020 ook in Nederland is neergestreken op de Dam (Trouw, 2020). Daarnaast bood onze koning voor het eerst officieel zijn excuses aan voor het koloniale verleden in Indonesië (NOS, 2020) en kreeg er voor het eerst een Surinamer die zich inzette voor de Surinaamse onafhankelijkheid, de schrijver Anton de Kom, een plaats in de officiële geschiedeniscanon van Nederland (Cloin, 2020). Ook in 2020 kwam de Adviescommissie Koloniale Collecties op 7 oktober met een advies aan de Tweede Kamer dat alle in Nederland aanwezige ‘roofkunst’ zonder voorwaarden terug moet naar het land van herkomst, wanneer dit land hier om vraagt (Kruijt, 2020). Dit onderzoek kijkt naar hoe er over roofkunst en koloniale cultuurgoederen en de mogelijke teruggave hiervan wordt gesproken in Nederlandse dagbladen in de periode van 16 oktober 2020, toen de adviescommissie werd opgericht, tot 31 oktober 2020. 

De manier waarop Nederlandse kranten een rol spelen in dit maatschappelijk belangrijke thema maakt het onderzoek relevant omdat kranten over het algemeen stellen onafhankelijk en objectief verslag te doen van de actualiteiten. Hierom zijn 39 artikelen uit de dagbladen Algemeen Dagblad, De Telegraaf, NRC Handelsblad, Trouw en de Volkskrant onderworpen aan een handmatige inhoudsanalyse en een framinganalyse (Semetko & Valkenburg; 2000; Van Noije & Wennekers; 2019). Hiermee kon ook wetenschappelijk worden aangetoond of, zoals gezien in eerdere onderzoeken, de kwaliteitskranten (Scholten & Bakker, 2019) NRC Handelsblad, Trouw en de Volkskrant meer frames gebruiken dan de populaire kranten Algemeen Dagblad en De Telegraaf. 

Uit het onderzoek bleek dat het onderwerp heel selectief interessant gevonden werd. De artikelen over het onderwerp gingen veelal over het advies van de adviescommissie of deze commissie werd op zijn minst een keer aangehaald. Hiernaast werd er aan het onderwerp enkel aandacht geschonken wanneer er een incident plaatsvond als de bekladding van of de diefstal uit een museum. Hierbij kon worden bevestigd dat de kwaliteitskranten in veel hogere mate gebruik maakten van frames dan de populaire kranten. Hierbij kwam het verantwoordelijkheidsframe het meest voor en Nederland werd ‘geframed’ als de verantwoordelijke. Het sentiment tegenover teruggave was hierbij bij de kwaliteitskranten ook veel positiever en er werden meer argumenten voor gegeven dan tegen. Bij de populaire kranten was dit precies andersom. 

Toekomstig onderzoek zou vooral moeten kijken naar wat er wordt gezegd in het journalistieke discourse door het uitvoeren van een kritische discoursanalyse. Nu we weten welke frames er worden gebruikt, is het interessant om te kijken hoe dit zich vertaalt in de specifieke inhoud van de artikelen. Ook kan het in zijn algemeenheid interessant zijn om te kijken of de reputatie van de dagbladen rond framing ook geldt wanneer je onderzoek doet naar minder beladen maatschappelijke thema’s."
"Caribische immigranten en het slavernijverleden in Utrecht: van
herdenking in kleine kring naar viering in het openbaar","['Wijngaarden, W.J. van']","['Raben, R.']",2021-09-07T18:01:11Z,nl,"['Caribische immigranten, Utrecht, Slavernijverleden, Post-kolinialisme, Keti-Koti']",Taal- en cultuurstudies,"In 1873 maakte Nederland een einde aan de slavernij door ook de opvolger daarvan, de
verplichte contractarbeid onder staatstoezicht, af te schaffen. Sindsdien is het in Nederland zeer
lang stil geweest rond dit thema. Toch is het niet zo dat er geen aandacht voor het
slavernijverleden gevraagd werd. Caribische immigranten (Surinamers of mensen van de
voormalig Nederlandse-Antillen) zijn, sinds hun aankomst in Nederland, altijd al met dit
onderwerp bezig geweest. Dit gebeurde in eerste instantie - tot eind jaren zestig - vooral op zeer
kleine schaal in de grote steden, onder leiding van voornamelijk universitaire Caribische
studenten. In Utrecht verenigden ze zich bijvoorbeeld in 1948 in de Surinaamse
Studentenvereniging Utrecht (SSVU).

Het actievoeren was in den beginne weinig succesvol. De (witte) Nederlandse
maatschappij stond om diverse redenen niet open voor een gesprek over de koloniale
geschiedenis en de gruwelen van de slavernij. Onder andere het beeld van ‘de Nederlandse
cultuur’ waarin dit onderwerp niet past, tezamen met de aanwezigheid van racisme en
discriminatie in de samenleving, een overheidsbeleid gericht op assimilatie en diverse crises
zijn hierop van invloed. Daarnaast zijn de actievoerders vaak tijdelijke migranten in de vorm
van studenten, die na hun afstuderen in Nederland weer vertrekken naar hun thuisland.

Van lange duur was de afwezigheid van aandacht voor het slavernijverleden echter niet.
Het vooruitzicht van Surinaamse onafhankelijkheid in 1975 zorgde ervoor dat zeer veel
Caribische immigranten permanent naar Nederland en Utrecht kwamen. Bij aankomst werd er
in eerste instantie wederom weinig aandacht aan het slavernijverleden besteed, zowel door de
Caribische immigranten als door de autochtone Nederlanders. Om diverse redenen veranderde
dit aan het begin van de jaren tachtig. Onder andere de opkomst van radio en televisie, de
toename van internationale reizen, de verbeterde welvaart van Caribische Nederlanders en
veranderend overheidsbeleid speelden hierin een rol. Ook ontstonden er veel
migrantenorganisaties die activiteiten organiseerden gericht op het slavernijverleden. In Utrecht
veranderde de SSVU in 1973 in de grote Landelijke Organisatie van Surinamers in Nederland
(LOSON). De eerste aandachtsgolf voor het slavernijverleden was een feit.

Diverse oorzaken, waaronder het gebrek aan wetenschappelijke literatuur ter
onderbouwing van het activisme, zorgden ervoor dat eind jaren negentig aandacht en activisme
voor het onderwerp verdwenen. Tien jaar later, omstreeks 2010, ontstond een tweede
aandachtsgolf voor het slavernijverleden. Onder andere de opkomst van een jonge,
hoogopgeleide en strijdlustige generatie die Nederland steeds meer als thuisland gaat zien speelt
hierin een rol, tezamen met de opkomst van sociale media, meer wetenschappelijke literatuur
en groeiende internationale aandacht voor dit onderwerp.

Deze tweede aandachtsgolf lijkt langer aan te houden dan de vorige golf, onder andere
vanwege de institutionalisering van de geschiedenis van de slavernij. Het slavernijverleden lijkt
daardoor - voor het eerst in de geschiedenis - steeds meer onderdeel van de Nederlandse en
Utrechtse publieke geschiedbeleving te worden. De vraag is hoelang deze tweede aandachtsgolf
zal blijven aanhouden. Blijft de aandacht voor het slavernijverleden groeien? Of komt ook deze
golf na verloop van jaren ten einde, net zoals in de jaren tachtig gebeurde?"

Many Arabs and Muslims in the United States became victims of “hate crimes, work place discrimination, bias incidents, and airline discrimination” (Alsultany, 2012, p. 4), and media started representing both Arabs and Muslims alike as the Other, by mainly talking about Arabs and Muslims, rather than giving them a voice in the discourse (Joseph, D’Harlingue & Wong, 2008). At the same time, Muslims were mainly portrayed in a negative way in U.S. media (Ahmed & Matthes, 2016; Nurullah, 2010). On January 27, 2017, former President Donald Trump released an executive order banning all individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 to 120 days. In this case, Muslims were the victims of a U.S. President’s decision, instead of the perpetrators of a terrorist attack on the United States. To find out whether this different role of Muslims also means they are differently represented in U.S. media, this study discovered how Muslims were represented in the initial news coverage of four American regional newspapers around President Trump’s travel ban in 2017. The regional perspective provides relevant insights because individuals and groups should not only be fairly represented in national papers, but also in regional ones. The Critical Discourse Analysis framework by Fairclough (1989) was used to analyze the representation of Muslims in a total of 100 newspaper articles from the Salt Lake Tribune (Utah), Dayton Daily News (Ohio), the Chicago Daily Herald (Illinois), and The Spokesman-Review (Washington). As Fairclough’s (1989) view on discourse searches for the relationship between texts and their social context, this study analyzed Muslim representation in discourse through a textual, discursive and social dimension. Findings showed that the four regional newspapers mainly referred to the individuals subject to the travel ban as refugees, Muslims, or by naming their country of origin. However, Chicago Daily Herald used more personal terms than the other newspapers. Regarding the attributes that were ascribed to the Muslims, the newspapers mostly wrote about them being banned from the United States, and being demonized. This supports earlier research by Ahmed & Matthes (2016) and Nurullah (2010) in that Muslims in U.S. media are mainly portrayed in a negative way. Dayton Daily News wrote least about the individuals being demonized, and The Spokesman-Review mostly wrote about them being accepted and sympathized, compared to the other newspapers. Furthermore, the Muslims themselves were given the least voice in the newspaper articles, while the most voice was given to institutional experts, who were mainly politicians. This lack of voice in the discourse supports previous research by Joseph, D’Harlingue & Wong (2008), Nurullah (2010), and Shaheen (2008), who found that Muslims were often represented as the Other in U.S. media. Though these findings portray a clear image of Muslim representation, it must be noted that the results have emerged from the initial ten days of news coverage and that different results will presumably be found in later news coverage."
“Do You Know What That Word Means?” Repair for Native and Non-native Speakers in the Talk Show Ellen,"['Fronen, C.A.M.']","['Micklos, A.M.', 'Hagar, T.J.']",2021-09-07T18:01:12Z,en,"['Conversation Analysis, repair, native/non-native interaction, semi-institutional discourse, talk shows, asymmetries, power relations']",Interculturele communicatie,"Conversational repair, a resource used to manage troubles in speaking, hearing or understanding, has been extensively researched in both conversational and institutionalized contexts. Talk shows are viewed as semi-institutionalized interaction, as features of both discourse types appear. Moreover, both native and non-native speakers are frequently part of interactions in this discourse type. This research explores the features of this semi-institutionalized interaction with regards to repair and the differences that may occur between native and non-native speakers. Furthermore, this research examines the influence of power, which exists within the context of a talk show as well as between speakers with asymmetrical language capabilities. In these asymmetrical power relations, identities as expert and novice may be assumed (Dings, 2012). Additionally, these power relations also exist by the nature of talk shows, as the show host is generally in control (Ilie, 2001). This study investigates 30 clips of repair occurring for native and non-native speakers in the talk show Ellen and uses Conversation Analysis to analyze the turn-taking sequence. The analysis shows that talk shows follow trends in repair of both institutional and conversational discourse, exemplifying its semi-institutional nature. Moreover, the analysis shows that repair is used to bring forward the identities of expert and novice, and to highlight the asymmetrical relations between show host and interviewee, as well as between native and non-native speakers. The latter is demonstrated by native speakers reassuring non-native speakers that their repair was unnecessary. Moreover, native speakers assumed their role as expert as they did not accept repair initiated by a non-native speaker, who has the underlying identity of novice. The talk show host assumes her position of power by deciding when the topic shift occurs, regardless of the interviewee’s understanding of the conversation. These power relations strengthen the semi-institutional discourse of talk shows."

The aim of this thesis was to investigate whether descriptions of prime minister Ardern in newspaper articles, changed during her pregnancy thus showing if her pregnancy had an influence on the image that the media had about her. This research was a combination of both quantitative and qualitative content analysis of newspaper articles from the newspaper The New Zealand Herald. The quantitative content analysis was completed with help of the program WordStat 8 and the qualitative content analysis consisted of close reading. Hereby showing the frequency and context of selected words and phrases related to Ardern in newspaper articles in different time frames. The results showed that after the announcement of the pregnancy, the distinction between private sphere and work sphere disappeared. After prime minister Ardern gave birth to her child, there was an even stronger focus on her private life. The husband was more frequently mentioned and words stereotypically linked to being female increased. Furthermore this study identified a decrease in words and phrases related to her work as a prime minister. Therefore a difference in the description of Ardern was found; after the announcement of the pregnancy news articles became more gendered."
Identification Processes of a Linguistic and Cultural Minority: A Study on the Swedish Minority of Finland,"['Lindroos, J.M.']","['Cole, Dr. D.']",2021-09-07T18:01:08Z,en,"['linguistic minority, identity, linguistic identity, cultural identity, stereotypes, nationalism']",Interculturele communicatie,"The status of the Finnish-Swedish minority has been a continuous debate in Finland. In order to see the future development of the minority in Helsinki, it is crucial to understand the present situation in relation to young bilinguals’ identification processes. Therefore, this study aims to explore the identification processes of the Swedish minority of Finland. Specifically, the goal is to investigate the factors that influence whether or not young bilinguals in Helsinki identify with the Finnish-Swedish minority. The study also aims to answer how their linguistic and cultural identities affect their identification with the Finnish-Swedish minority, as well as what their attitudes are toward the Finnish-Swedish minority itself. 

A qualitative and inductive method was chosen in order to answer the research questions. Ethnographic interviews were conducted with five participants. A textual analysis was conducted in five stages. More specifically, the data was analysed by a thematic analysis to identify broad themes and patterns. The results showed patterns in the participants’ linguistic and cultural identities in relation to their linguistic backgrounds and experiences. Stereotypes and nationalism were also important themes in regard to attitudes toward the Finnish-Swedish minority. Moreover, both essentialist and fluid perspectives emerged in relation to culture. 

The factors that influence whether or not young bilinguals in Helsinki identify with the Finnish-Swedish minority are concluded as linguistic backgrounds and the language in which they attended school. Moreover, the attitudes held by the young bilinguals toward the minority itself influence their own identification. The final factor is context, as this study found that the participants’ identities are fluid and shift depending on situations and social interactions."

Uit dit onderzoek blijkt dat de invloeden op de subjectieve ervaring van verantwoordelijkheid in het verkeer met name bestaan uit controlevermindering, keuzevrijheid en gebalanceerd vertrouwen. Voor de toekomst van de volledig zelfrijdende auto’s, die nu nog niet zijn toegestaan, is het van belang het verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel van bestuurders hoog te houden en in combinatie met een heldere wetgeving kunnen de determinanten op de juiste manier beïnvloed worden. Verder praktisch onderzoek moet uitwijzen of de speculatieve methoden die dit onderzoek biedt voor onder andere het vertrouwen in de technologie dusdanig volstaan voor genoeg verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel.

A questionnaire concerning attitude formation and an hourlong focus group on interactive identity construction have provided the data for the answers to the research questions. The results showed that the majority of the participants identified as binational and that factors such as significant others and upbringing influence how attitude towards identity is established. Moreover, it was found that national identity was constructed in interaction through the processes of self-identification and identity-ascription-by-others (Zhu, 2019), and (dis)identification with others (Messelink & Ten Thije, 2012). In practice, identity was discursively constructed through the tactics of intersubjectivity proposed by Bucholtz and Hall (2005b). The results suggested that the participants’ separate attitudes towards their nationalities in a specific interaction influenced how they performed their binational identity. Moreover, the binational identity was discursively constructed in such a way that its performance showed an inclination towards either nationality, depending on the interlocutor, conversation topic, and environment."
Normative Power Europe and the Uyghur Genocide: The effect of the Uyghur genocide on the EU’s norm diffusion policy,"['Knaap, L.E. van der']","['Mavrodin, C.']",2021-09-07T18:01:31Z,en,['European Union; Normative Power Europe; China; Uyghur; Human Rights; Genocide'],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"It is often theorised that the European Union is a normative power, but little is known about the EU’s functioning as a normative power in areas further removed from its direct neighbourhood. China’s influence in world politics has increased sharply in the last decade, but so have the worrisome reports on human rights violations, especially in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Thus far, researchers believe that the EU reduces its normative approach in favour of economic interests in relation to authoritarian regimes.  
The goal of this research is to investigate whether the events in Xinjiang – such as unlawful detentions, mass surveillance, forced labour – have influenced the EU’s normative behaviour towards China. To do so, the thesis answers the following question: To what extend did the Uyghur genocide have an influence on the EU to change its normative policy towards China since 2014? In that year, the Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism was launched. 
To answer the research question, the thesis analyses eight key instances of EU interaction with the crisis, divided over three thematically different periods. The analysis makes use of the guidelines and questions formulated by Niemann and De Wekker to determine the level of normative intent, process, and impact of the actions and documents.  
The research showed that the EU’s policy towards China did become more normative due to the events in Xinjiang. It therefore concludes that the EU prioritises norms over economics in relation to authoritarian states such as China in critical situations. To further investigate this theory, additional research could focus on the tension in Hong Kong."

Het doel van dit onderzoek is de theoretische kloof tussen representatieonderzoek en receptieonderzoek te overbruggen. Acht diepte-interviews zijn afgenomen met homoseksuele mannen tussen de 20 en 26 jaar. Door middel van grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014) zijn de interviews geanalyseerd en kwalitatief gecodeerd. Uit de analyse zijn drie hoofdthema’s voortgekomen: Perceptie, waaruit blijkt hoe het genre van Prince Charming, de mentaliteit van de 
participanten en de herkenning in het programma een rol spelen in hoe de participanten betekenis geven aan dit programma; Representatie, waaruit blijkt dat stereotypen en gebrek aan diversiteit in dit programma nog steeds voorkomen, maar er ook al stappen worden genomen dit te verbeteren; en Emancipatie, waaruit blijkt dat de ontvangst van zo’n programma niet alleen betrekking heeft op het programma zelf, maar het een reactie teweeg brengt bij de participanten en een ontwikkeling is in de maatschappij. Daarnaast blijkt dat heteronormativiteit nog sterk aanwezig is in de media en maatschappij en bestaat de wens homoseksualiteit op tv te normaliseren en realistisch te weergeven. Dit onderzoek laat zien hoe representaties in Prince Charming voorkomen, en hoe sterk de betekenissen en implicaties van deze representaties afhangen van de lezingen van het publiek, gesitueerd in culturele en sociale contexten."

Verschillende theorieën en hypotheses zijn geopperd, maar tot op heden is er nog geen sluitend antwoord gevonden op de vraag in welke mate de T1 invloed heeft op de verwerving van de T2. De Transferhypothese stelt dat deze invloed groot is en dat T2-leerders fouten maken in de productie van de T2 doordat ze de T1 imiteren (Lado, 1957). Dit zijn zogenaamde interferentiefouten. De Creatieve Constructie Hypothese is ontstaan uit de kritiek op de Transferhypothese (Dulay et al., 1982). Volgens deze theorie heeft de T1 weinig invloed op de T2 en maken T1-verwervers en T2-leerders dezelfde fouten. In dit corpusonderzoek heb ik, aan de hand van verschillende corpora met gesproken uitingen van T1-verwervers, gekeken of Nederlandse T1-verwervers fouten maken in woordvolgorde en of deze foutieve woordvolgordes overeenkomen met fouten die je op basis van interferentie zou kunnen verwachten bij Engelse T2-leerders van het Nederlands. Bij iets minder dan de helft van de foutieve woordvolgordes bleek dit het geval te zijn. Dit onderzoek sluit dus aan bij de kritiek op de Transferhypothese. Daarnaast zijn er in dit onderzoek uitingen meegenomen van een Engels-Nederlands kind dat tweetalig wordt opgevoed. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de meeste fouten die dit kind maakt, op één specifieke soort fout na, ook gemaakt worden door de eentalige verwervers van het Nederlands."

Forster']",English Language and Culture,"This thesis explores the paradoxical concurrence of masculinity and emotionality in E.M. Forster's Maurice (1971). Scrutinising the construction of masculinity in early-twentieth-century England, it argues that the novel challenges contemporary norms of English manhood through Maurice’s and Clive’s recurrent and profuse shedding of tears. Generally interpreted as a weakness, emotionality has usually been repressed by men in order to sustain their masculine identity (Jansz 166). Maurice’s continual emotional unrest throughout the novel subverts the requirement for men to be emotionally discreet and demonstrates that repressing emotions clashes with human nature. Linking the novel’s thematisation of tears to Judith Butler’s gender performativity theory (Gender Trouble 1990; Bodies That Matter 1993) as well as previous research on the role of gender in emotional behaviour (Lutz 1999; Jansz 2000; Fivush and Buckner 2000; Ross-Smith and Kornberger 2004), this thesis argues that the recurrence of tears in Maurice undermines the conception of gender as a fixed category. As one of the first literary works to openly thematise homosexuality, Maurice ultimately asks for a reconsideration of the limits of masculinity as well as the exclusion of vulnerable emotion from English manhood."

The literature aimed at this age group reflects this in its treatment of identity, which is often a much larger part of the story than it is in literature aimed at adults. In recent years, academic discussions of Young Adult (YA) literature have become more numerous. Many of these discussions take only one or two YA series as their objects of analysis. This thesis aimed to outline how the process of identity formation occurs in and around Young Adult novels through a combination of general analysis, close reading, and fandom analysis. The selection of novels was limited to series within the fantasy genre. Three types of novels were distinguished on the basis of their treatment of identity: in the first type a character is categorised on the basis of their identity, the second type contain categories into which a character is born, and the third type forgoes categorisation altogether. Instead, the identity of these characters is formed only through the society they live in, the people they engage with, and the events in the novel. Type one novels were found to emphasise community through like-mindedness, showing the reader that they can find a community of people that resemble them. Type two novels are less concerned with agency, and more with acceptance of what one is born as. Type three novels tell the reader that their choices, informed by the people around them, will shape their identity."

During that time many new bands were formed, including Flairck. Despite Flairck's reluctance to classify their music as folk music, they are often classified as such because of the use of specific folk instruments and elements of folk music. For example, in order to classify their compositions, interviewers and critics called it 'symphonic folk' and 'open air chamber music', which also refers to folk music. In this thesis, I compare the definitions of 'music rivival' by Caroline Bithell, Juniper Hill, Owe Rönstrom, Neil V. Rosenberg and Mark Slobin. In addition, I will review Alan Jabbour's concept of 'instrumental folk revival'.
This thesis focuses on Flairck's second single, Voorspel in Sofia, as a case study due to its use of the nai: a lăutari panflute. This is an instrument about which little is known, but which is key to answering the main question. Hence, this thesis will discuss the origin and organology of this instrument. Through defining ‘folk music revival’, an analysis of the transcription of Voorspel in Sofia, and information about the nai, I argue to what extent Flairck's music can be linked to the concept of 'folk music revival'. Although Flairck originally composed in their own particular style, given the information about the nai and the arguments of various scholars, I can conclude that the members of Flairck can indeed be considered revivalists."

Hierbij is onderzocht of het geschiedenisonderwijs met betrekking tot het slavernijverleden van rond 2000 verschilt met het geschiedenisonderwijs van rond 2020. De verandering tussen deze meetpunten is gekoppeld aan het historiografisch en maatschappelijk debat van de afgelopen 25 jaar. De analyse laat zien dat de representatie van het slavernijverleden gedeeltelijk is veranderd. Belangrijke oorzaken hiervan zijn de invoering van de tien tijdvakken en de canon van Nederland in het geschiedeniscurriculum. In het onderzoek valt op dat recente schoolboeken, in tegenstelling tot oudere schoolboeken, aandacht hebben voor agency en leefomstandigheden van de slaafgemaakten. Ook wordt in de recente schoolboeken de welvaart van Nederland gekoppeld aan slavernij en slavenhandel.

Towards a New Theoretical Framework for the Concept Album,"['Somberg, A.']","['Ahrendt, R.']",2021-09-07T18:01:30Z,en,['Concept album'],Muziekwetenschap,"Concept albums have existed since the introduction of the Long Play (LP), but the exact definition of the concept album is still up for debate. This is evident from the multitude of varying definitions in circulation and the discussion of definitions in recent academic literature. The problems with defining the concept album have as a consequence that it proves difficult to identify concept albums. The aim of this thesis is not to come up with a solution or a conclusive strategy, but rather to assess the theoretical frameworks applied to defining and identifying the concept album and to make suggestions towards a new theoretical framework. I do this by performing a critical literature review, analysing the concept album taxonomy, the paratext and the concept album continuum. I then apply the frameworks to the album Offerings by Typhoon to assess their possible uses and flaws. This thesis proposes to view the issues concerning the definition of the concept album as a characteristic rather than a problem, and proposes that future research takes an unified approach to defining and identifying the concept album. By combining the theoretical frameworks in this thesis, a new analytical model could be made to offer a systematical approach to defining and identifying concept albums."
"The effect of repeated sand nourishments on long-term nearshore evolution: a case study for Noordwijk aan Zee, the Netherlands","['Vermeer, N.P.']","['Ruessink, B.G.', 'Price, T.D.']",2021-09-07T18:01:58Z,en,['Building with Nature; Shoreface nourishments; Beach nourishments; Nearshore bars; Coastal morphodynamics; Crescentic sandbars; Rip channels; Dutch coast'],Earth Surface and Water,"Sand nourishments are executed along many sandy coasts worldwide to counteract coastal erosion, with the sand added as beach nourishments to the inter- and supratidal beach or as shoreface nourishments to the subtidal nearshore profile. Since the early 1990s beach and shoreface nourishments have been carried out along the Dutch coast, with a total nourished volume of on average 12 Mm3/year. Although we have a reasonable understanding of the temporary effects of individual nourishments on the evolution of nearshore morphology, the long-term effects of repeated nourishments remain unclear. This knowledge is not only crucial for the safety of beachgoers and marine life, but also because it is expected that the number and volume of nourishments will increase in view of expected accelerating sea level rise in the near future. 

The aim of this thesis is to assess how repeated nourishments impact the long-term evolution of the shoreline and the two subtidal sandbars at Noordwijk aan Zee, The Netherlands, using Argus video imagery available since 1995. Four shoreface and three beach nourishments were realised at the study site between 1998 and 2014. The low tide time-exposure images of the Argus video station were used to monitor the position of the shoreline and sandbars along a 6-km stretch of coast. We found that the sandbars slowly but persistently migrated seaward prior to the first nourishment. The repeated nourishments permanently reduced this offshore migration rate of the bars to only a few metres per year. The sandbars exhibited alternating periods of seasonal to multi-annual offshore and onshore migration that were superimposed on the weak decadal offshore trend. Moreover, the numerous sand nourishments gave rise to a forked shoreline-sandbar morphology. Bar switches, in which the landward part of a sandbar or the shoreline on one side of the bifurcation realigned with the seaward part of a bar on the other side, nullified this large-scale alongshore variability within 1 - 2 years. These switches seem to be a direct result of the repeated nourishments. The 2013-2014 succession of a beach and a shoreface nourishment, for example, led to four bar switches in the following two years, whereas there were only of 12 switches in total in the data set of 24.8 years. In addition, this study confirms that bar switches not solely depend on wave height, but the angle of wave incidence is also crucial for their development. Another observation was that the primarily in-phase coupled low-tide shoreline and inner barline did not directly become more crescentic due to the nourishments. Hence, the presence of associated rip channels also did not increase, but their spatial distribution changed from the inner bar to the low-tide shoreline after repeated beach nourishments. Further research should be conducted to investigate whether these findings also apply to other nourished coasts worldwide."
"Sentiment analysis of user generated geographical content produced by locals and tourists across multiple geo-social media platforms: a case study in London, UK","['Beiwinkel, C.']","['Ostermann, F. O.']",2021-09-07T18:02:00Z,en_US,"['geo-social media, sentiment analysis, geographic data science, spatial analysis, user-generated geographical content, spatial statistics, web scraping']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"Recent advances in information technology have sparked increased availability of geographical information produced by users of geo-social platforms. Researchers have used this user-generated geographical content in various contexts, yet a deeper understanding of how content is produced differently by users local to a given region and users that are merely tourists there is required, especially across more than one geo-social media platform.

This thesis explores the content produced by tourists and locals in a case study set in London, UK. Data is retrieved from Twitter and TripAdvisor, spanning from February 2018 to January 2019. For Twitter, only tweets that contain a Place of Interest (POI) place tag are used in order to conceptually match the geographical information retrieved for TripAdvisor. Users are classified as tourists or locals using the n-days approach and the users' location field information. Sentiments of tweets and reviews are analyzed using the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER). Finally, the quantity  and sentiments  of reviews and tweets produced by tourists and locals are analyzed across time and space. While an integration of the data from the two sources is possible, especially because the location information retrieved from both platforms’ data is conceptually alike, an interpretation of the merged data is of little use.
The results are then analyzed separately for each platform. They show that there are small but significant differences between locals and tourists on both Twitter and TripAdvisor.  These include (1) higher activity among tourists during the early summer months than among locals; (2) places visited by tourists have a stronger geographically central tendency than those that locals visit; (3) tourists exhibit more negative sentiments in the mid/late summer months; (4) overall, tourists exhibit slightly lower compound sentiments than locals. Apart from these, there are further differences that can be observed within one of the two platforms, such as lower sentiment of local users during weekends on Twitter, and more significant differences between locals’ and tourists’ sentiment at POI closer to the study area’s center.

It is concluded that the place-tagged tweets from Twitter present an interesting alternative to the geo-tagged tweets, but that a more profound investigation of these places is required. The same goes for the approach used to classify tourists and locals: a combined approach has proven a reliable method, but further research into the different possible combinations of various approaches is needed."
"Emerging Institutions in the Global Space Sector
An Institutional Logics Approach","['Bandau, S.L.']","['Yap, X.S.']",2021-09-02T18:00:20Z,en,['Outer space; Sustainability transitions; Institutional Logics; Astropolitics; Governance; values; socio-technical configuration analysis'],Innovation Sciences,"The outer space (hereinafter Space) sector is currently going through major transformation. Since its inception, the sector is characterized by geopolitical interests and tensions. However, new Space-based technologies have shown how the sector can serve as supporter and enabler for accelerating sustainable development. Technological changes such as digitization and miniaturization have reduced the cost of accessing and using space, opening up new opportunities also for private actors. The sector is therefore increasingly competed among different actors with different interests. Given these challenges, the question is whether the current global Space sector can overcome these conflicting values and make a successful transition towards accelerating sustainable development. Therefore, the study aims to identify the emerging institutions of the global Space sector, including not only formal but also informal institutions such as the kind of values and interests actors adhere to and how they may influence the direction of the sectoral development.
Sustainability transition research has increasingly adopted international perspectives on how sectors may transform over time towards more sustainable direction. However, research on the political dimensions of changing sociotechnical configurations and the interaction at the international level remains limited. This study adopts the institutional logics approach as a medium to incorporate geopolitics in Space and governance literature in the analysis of transitions. More specifically, this study applied a socio-technical configuration analysis (STCA) based on discourses in newspaper articles and government documents, covering two contrasting cases of Earth Observation (EO) and Navigation services to identify different prevailing value orientations among actors. 
The results indicate that value orientations between actors differ significantly, resulting in different international collaboration patterns. The Navigation case is characterized by rather incoherent value dispositions. Cooperation serves primarily as a tool to support geopolitical strategies, national self-interest, and the desire for a dominant competitive position in the global market. Due to the ongoing geopolitical tensions, the sector faces major challenges in achieving a strong directionality in engendering sustainable development in the future. In contrast, the value orientations of the various actors in the EO case are more aligned on a global scale. Actors mainly entered cooperation to pursue common goals at the global level. The field, therefore, projects stronger directionality in maximizing its potentials to accelerate sustainable development, with the presence of similar collective priorities and substantial international cooperation. Overall, the contrasting results show that the future global Space sector will consist of different and partly diverging structures of institutions and cooperation patterns."
Particle Trajectories in Topography-Induced Currents: Looking for Chaos,"['Wal, S.T. van der']","['Swart, H.E. de', 'Frank, J.E.', 'Schramkowski, G.P.']",2021-09-07T18:02:06Z,en,"['Chaos, Hamiltonian System, Residual Currents, Splitting Method, Lyapunov exponent, Symplectic Map, Poincare section']","Meteorology, Physical Oceanography and Climate","Tidal waves are experienced all over the world. In shallow tidal areas, the tidal current over a bottom-topography leads to induced residual currents. To study the effect of these residual currents in combination with the tidal current on the trajectories of passive particles, previous studies used a simplified Hamiltonian model. To compensate for the neglected terms, the relative strength of the residual currents was overestimated. It was shown that under certain circumstances the dynamics leads to chaotic particle trajectories in phase space. In this study it is shown that, up to first order, the chaotic behaviour, as previously found, is not as commonly present in these systems. Furthermore, this study tries to investigate the effect of adding the Coriolis-term, a vorticity-harmonic term and a divergent term, which were previously neglected, to the dynamics. The effects of adding these terms in the dynamical equations did not trigger the onset of chaotic particle trajectories. In order to compute these particle trajectories, a splitting method is adapted to fit the time-periodic forcing that is present in these tidal systems. In contrast to previously used methods, this numerical method preserves the symplectic structure of the time-evolution of a Hamiltonian system. In the order of hundreds of tidal periods, this method produces similar results to Runge-Kutta methods for the majority of the cases. For longer periods of time, the Runge-Kutta methods showed divergence of the particle trajectories, even when this is not expected by the dynamics equations. A special case in phase space was found for choosing typical parameters that link to the Bessel functions (Beerens, Ridderinkhof, and Zimmerman 1994). In these special cases the shape of the particle trajectories changes significantly. For future studies, this behaviour may be of interest. Future studies may also look at adding even more tidal constituents to the dynamics or investigating the effect of choosing a bottom-topography with different spatial form. The numerical method presented here, may be applied in different problems, where the system of interest (largely) obeys a symplectic nature and allows for a splitting method."
The Online Presence of Liveability: Using sentiment derived from Twitter messages as an indicator of liveability.,"['Haas, M.J.M. de']","['Helbich, M.', 'Geertman, S. C. M.']",2021-09-07T18:02:00Z,en,"['Twitter, Natural language processing, sentiment, liveability']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"High liveability is associated with benefits like socio-economic equity, inclusive social systems, and improved mental and physical health. Assessing and afterwards effectively improving liveability has been a goal of local, national, and international governments and initiatives. The ambiguity of the concept of liveability complicates its assessment. This study examined the use of residents’ sentiment as an indicator of liveability in the Netherlands and explored ways to collect residents’ sentiment from location-based social networks.
In this study, eight methods for deriving sentiment from Twitter messages were compared. The best performing method, based on Youden’s J and percentage of tweets classified, was used to classify the of index dataset of Twitter messages from 2019 located within the Netherlands to sentiment. A total of 1 375 203 tweets was classified, and the resulting sentiment was grouped to the 380 municipalities of the Netherlands. The sentiment scores were compared to the expected liveability patterns, and to an existing liveability index from the Netherlands: the Leefbaarometer 2.0, version of 2018.
A Naïve Bayes’ classifier performed the best in the performance assessment, with a Youden’s J of 0,46. The mean sentiment per municipality showed no similarities to the expected liveability patterns on a national scale, but the expected large regional differences in the peripheral regions were present in the sentiment scores. The mean sentiment and the existing liveability index showed a weak positive relation in the cursory visual analysis, but no statistical relation was found. In conclusion, the sentiment derived from twitter messages in this study does not significantly represent liveability.
Exploring additional sentiment classification methods and using more training data could improve the quality of the sentiment analysis, further solidifying the conclusive strength of research on sentiment and liveability. Another valuable path to follow in future research includes dissecting liveability and analysing the relation of sentiment to its different aspects."
The effectiveness of a new business model for professional cycling teams in relation to sponsorship of companies in the commercial cycling industry,"['Bugter, J.J.']","['van Rijnsoever, F.']",2021-09-07T18:01:58Z,en,[],Innovation Sciences,"Due to the historical development and the nature of cycling, the business model for professional cycling teams is almost exclusively financed by sponsorship money today. This creates a lot of uncertainty, where teams often quit when the sponsorship stops. However, there are currently teams working and experimenting with the creation of more sustainable business models, where a team, the sponsors and fans are better connected to increase the value for all involved stakeholders. 

In scientific research, purchase intentions of consumers has become an important indicator for the effectiveness of sponsorship in sports. However, literature concerning the effect of sponsorship in relation to this concept is limited today. To investigate the process to increase product sales via sponsorship, this research uses simulations from discrete choice experiments to measure these purchase intentions. I developed a conceptual framework to examine the role a cycling team plays in the relationship between fans and the connected sponsors, based on a semi-professional cycling team in the Netherlands. In this model, the effect of four attributes (i.e. team design, brand visibility, price & athlete usage) and four moderating variables (i.e. team loyalty, athlete loyalty, sponsorship awareness & sponsorship attitude) on purchase intentions of cycling fans is investigated. By comparing the outcomes of the conceptual model between the closely connected fans (the club members), and a general group of cycling fans, the effect of club membership is explored as well. 

Overall, the outcomes indicate that the loyalty to a team, its athletes and the related sponsors does increase purchase intentions of cycling fans, which supports the effectiveness of the new business model in professional cycling. However, not all stated hypotheses were supported by the results. Testing the effect of these variables on fans’ purchase intentions with the use of a choice experiment adds a new dimension to measuring sponsorship effectiveness that provides useful managerial insights. The results could be used by professional cycling teams to quantify and explain the added value of a community based business model to potential sponsors. Thereby, the proposed conceptual model and recommendations derived from the analysis provide valuable cues for future research and extend the knowledge of sponsorship in professional sports."

This exposure of humans to volcanic hazards, the personal exposure to volcanic hazards, can be assessed by many different methods. What remains uncertain is what assessment methods are best suited for a global assessment of the personal exposure to volcanic hazards. The aim of this thesis is to determine the best suited method for the assessment of exposure to volcanic hazards. This method is tested with the use of a case study on a continental area, Central America. If the personal exposure can be compared on a global scale, countries around the world will be able to exchange volcanic hazard management strategies easier. Hereby, mapping out the personal exposure to volcanic hazard on a global scale will contribute to the reduction of populations at risk for volcanic hazards. The assessment of personal exposure to volcanic hazards is divided into sub-topics; the driving mechanisms for people to life in the vicinity of volcanoes and different volcanic hazards, different methods to assess personal exposure to volcanism on a global scale and testing the best suited method. The assessment of different levels of volcanic explosivity was studied with the use of the VEI, the spatial assessment of volcanic hazards is investigated by explaining the five most frequently used volcanic hazards map types; geology-based maps, integrated qualitative maps, modelling-based hazard maps, probabilistic hazard maps and administrative maps. The three most used personal exposure assessment methods, the PEI, VPI and the VRC are discussed. The method considered best suited for the assessment of personal exposure to volcanic hazards on a global scale is the Population Exposure Index. The case study concludes that five out of the 110 volcanoes in Central America are assigned to a PEI-7, which is the highest level of the Population Exposure Index."

A Mixed Methods Research about Assessment Strategies and Teaching Practices in a Multilingual Classroom","['Weller, P.S.']","['Steffens, MS', 'Baauw, SB']",2021-09-08T18:00:21Z,en,"['NAM education, implicit knowledge, heritage languages, metalinguistic awareness']",Interculturele communicatie,"With the rising number of migrant pupils in the European education systems who do not have sufficient knowledge of the new country’s language of schooling, educators are being challenged to successfully integrate pupils into their new schools and classes. In Germany, DaZ teachers often have different levels of expertise and professional backgrounds, while not enough guidance or recommendations on effective didactics are available. Especially the development of implicit language knowledge has been identified as essential for the process of language acquisition and language competence. However, how to concretely measure and use implicit knowledge, especially in the context of newly arrived migrant (NAM) children education, has thus far not been studied. Therefore, this research aimed at identifying efficient language learning methods for the assessment and application of implicit knowledge in second language teaching. In this context, it was further focused on the incorporation of pupils’ first languages as their application cannot only help when assessing knowledge, but its development stage has also a direct impact on the acquisition of another language. For the data collection, a mixed methods approach was chosen. Firstly, an online survey was distributed amongst DaZ and DaF teachers, which was followed by a focus group interview with DaZ teachers to discuss the survey results and receive recommendations for beneficial practices. The results suggest that methods need to deviate from explicit learning strategies and focus more on authentic practices, composed of a variety of free speaking exercises to directly draw on pupils’ prior knowledge. Especially visual materials, storytelling, narrative conversations, and scenic role play were recommended for the assessment and use of implicit knowledge. Through the incorporation of pupils’ first language into teaching and project work, their metalinguistic awareness can be strengthened, and a stronger bond between students and teachers can be created. This also includes recognising NAM children’s languages as an asset rather than a disadvantage. Implementing these recommendations will not only have a positive effect on the migrant pupil’s language development but also their overall inclusion in the new environment."

comprehension experiment. Using impulsive behaviours as ‘inspiration’, which are behaviours that tend to work 
with various triggers depending on the individual, a simplified experiment containing three reading 
comprehension trials was devised. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic resulting in the lack of participants suffering 
from impulsive disorders, 15 random acquaintances were chosen to participate. During trial one, participants 
had to read a text and then answer 10 questions about it. Trial two introduced clickable brown ‘stains’ as a 
nuisance to the reading screen, which appeared at a randomized time, in a randomized location and had a 
randomized size. Trial three did the same as trial two with the addition of popups following the removal of a 
‘stain’. The experiment examined whether adding an obstacle or extra step (popups) to an action (removing 
stains) would change the behaviour of people. The results were more related to attention than human evaluative 
conditioning, and inconclusive since multiple issues prevented the experiment from being performed in the 
proper conditions. 2/3 of the participants were not bothered by the ‘stains’, which is counterintuitive to what was
expected, and thus produced no data on stain removal. However, results showed that the addition of stains led to 
more attentional shifts and less accurate answers to questions. Overall, their performance during the third trial 
was better, which could be due to the familiarity effect, i.e., they got used to stains. The other 1/3 of participants 
showed a stark difference in behaviour. They suffered from disorders like dyslexia, ADHD, impulsiveness, and 
autism. They were bothered by stains and actually clicked them away, which reinforces the correlation between 
concentration issues and people suffering disorders like ADHD, impulsiveness, dyslexia, and perhaps even 
autism. Reading with distractions is more difficult for people with attention related disorders. Further study in 
better conditions is needed to investigate whether impulses to remove a distraction can be reduced."

The investigation considered the articles written by four newspapers and one press agency per country, on the day before and the day after the speech. The differences and similarities within and between the French and Burkinese corpora were observed and interpreted with the aid of Postcolonial Critical Discourse Analysis (PCDA). The data were placed in the context of the relations between France and its sub-Saharan ex-colonies, the notion of Françafrique and Postcolonial Theory. The results of the analysis demonstrated the continuation of the colonial power relations between France and Burkina Faso. The power imbalance, where France is the more powerful and Burkina Faso the less powerful, is recognized by the press in both countries. France’s endeavours to maintain its power in Burkina Faso can be seen as a continuation of their colonial policy, which they attempt to conceal by offering money for development, sending soldiers for fighting terrorism and emphasizing the ties of the French language and culture. Burkina Faso is aware of its position as the powerless, and the Burkinese press gives room for anti-imperialistic sentiments. Yet, the country benefits from the relations as well and is caught up in its inferior position in the power relations, which was formed through history and is not simple to escape from."

Jordan and Pune, India). The Socio-Ecological Systems (SES) concept is utilized to establish
a theory-neutral framework that bridges both material and institutional analysis. Concerning the material part of the work, the nexus footprint concept is elaborated to operationalize
the nexus term in order to reflect on micro-scale resource interlinkages. In the institutional
analysis, policy integration as complementary theory to nexus governance is utilized. As a
final step, the thesis discloses the alignment of governance with the respective urban water-energy nexus issue in the regarded cases. The explorative approach of the work closes a
persistent gap in urban nexus research as it combines both the study of material conditions
and the subsequent implications for policy. Additionally, it gives valuable insights in the
nexus challenges of two specific cities in the global south. Concludingly, the practicality
of the nexus footprint concept to operationalize the nexus is confirmed. Thus, the mixed-methods approach of the thesis enhances the local perspective on resource interrelations and
stresses the importance of the urban level for nexus governance. Policy integration theory
for analyzing nexus governance in the face of a resource challenge is found to be beneficial in
establishing a horizon for institutional comprehension of the nexus. Both case studies reveal
a low governmental recognition concerning the identified nexus issues. Lastly, the approach
of the thesis offers a template for future nexus studies by strengthening the attractiveness of
urban nexus research. The template could be expanded to include the full spectrum of FEW
(food-energy-water) nexus resources in the study approach which is already incentivized by
the nexus footprint concept."
Rebuilding life after conflict; A case study of female ex-combatant reintegration in South Sudan,"['Bakker, E.J.M.']","['Gould, L.']",2021-09-08T18:00:25Z,en,"['Female ex-combatants, South Sudan, gender-sensitive DDR programming, human needs approach, reintegration']",International Relations in Historical Perspective,"This thesis assesses the reintegration needs of female ex-combatants in South Sudan. Although research has been conducted on the various roles women played in armed groups, the role they should entail in negotiation processes, or how female ex-combatants evaluate the implemented DDR programme, no research has been conducted on the specific reintegration needs female ex-combatants express that influence a successful reintegration process. This thesis provides insights into these perceived reintegration needs and furthermore provides a critical reflection on DDR programming in general and the needs assessment carried out prior to the DDR implementation phase in South Sudan.

Based on the theoretical framework of human needs satisfaction, this thesis aims to develop a further understanding of the perceived economic, social and political reintegration needs and whether there is a hierarchy present for these needs. The answers of 1692 female ex-combatants, 3730 male ex-combatants and 6508 community members from South Sudan that completed a survey between August and December 2020 were analysed. The results show that female ex-combatants prioritise their economic and social human needs, which indicates that a hierarchy of needs is present in accordance with the theoretical framework. This holds implications for their reintegration, as their economic and social needs should be prioritised for a successful reintegration. 

This thesis furthermore presents a critical reflection of DDR programming, that used to neglect the gender aspect of reintegration. A discrepancy in policy and practice was found in South Sudan, as well as in other case studies where reintegration programmes do not reflect the actual needs of the ex-combatants. This thesis aims to provide new insights by assessing a needs assessment carried out to inform the upcoming DDR programme in South Sudan as this subject enjoys limited coverage in the academic debate. A critical reflection shows that although gender sensitivity is strived for, the tools used for the needs assessment reflect limited gender sensitivity. The quantitative nature of the tools is furthermore discussed and this thesis argues that additional qualitative research tools could provide additional in depth knowledge often required to analyse complicated societal processes."

Dit negatieve beeld wordt op verschillende vlakken genuanceerd, maar de negatieve visie behoudt alsnog de dominante positie.

as cooperation in imperfect information environments. 
However, cooperative games with imperfect information are an 
uncommon topic for AI, which is why we have researched such 
a game called The Crew. We implemented the card game into 
a program and made an AI that can play it using different 
algorithms. We experimented with a random algorithm, a 
cooperative multi-agent greedy algorithm called CoopGreedy, 
and a competitive multi-agent greedy algorithm called
CompGreedy. These algorithms also incorporated heuristics to 
improve their performance. Our results showed that
CoopGreedy outperformed the other algorithms considerably. 
CoopGreedy in combination with the Expected Value Hand 
Estimation Heuristic and the Longest Suit Higher Card Goal 
Selection Heuristic also noticeably improved performance. We 
also found that CoopGreedy performed better with perfect 
information than with imperfect information. Our findings 
indicate that cooperation and heuristics improved performance 
significantly, but that imperfect information impedes AI 
performance. We can derive from our experiment that 
CoopGreedy could be used as a benchmark algorithm for 
further research. We recommend future research on local

The participants were divided into three target groups: a) monolinguals (i.e., one mother tongue) with limited proficiency in a foreign language, b) early bilinguals, (i.e., two mother tongues) raised within a bilingual family, and c) “late” multilinguals, individuals raised in a monolingual family, but acquired more than two foreign languages later. Particularly, the study sought to investigate, on the one hand, how the study-abroad experience influenced the participants’ perceived anxiety in their foreign-language interactions and, on the other hand, to explore possible differences and similarities between the three groups regarding the most anxiety-inducing factors. A quantitative survey was used in combination with qualitative follow-up interviews, as research instruments. Results revealed that the monolingual group experienced the highest FLA, followed by the “late” multilinguals, while the early bilinguals were found to be the least susceptible to FLA. Fear of negative evaluation and communication apprehension were identified as two fundamental dimensions of the FLA. Of particular interest was the finding regarding the early bilinguals’ and “late” multilinguals’ attention to speaking the foreign language proficiently."

Together, these soft law 
agreements externalise European migration management to Libya, inter alia, through strengthening border control and enhancing the capacity of Libyan authorities, including the Libyan Coast Guard. This externalisation is contested, as it potentially encompasses European support for, and enablement of, human rights violations in Libya, and breaches the principle of non-refoulement. To understand how and why the EU engages in such unconscionable policies, a process tracing analysis is conducted. This thesis argues the externalisation of European migration management to Libya arose and subsisted through the conclusion of two sequenced, incomplete and ambiguous agreements, and is likely a consequence of the securitisation of migration, diverging interests, and organised hypocrisy in the European Union."

Quantification of shallow land subsidence in Groningen since the start of the gas extraction in 1963 using daily groundwater dynamics,"['Reudink, L.']","['Stouthamer, E.', 'Janssen, C.J.E.']",2021-09-08T18:00:47Z,en,"['Land subsidence, shallow subsurface, Groningen, groundwater level, compression, peat oxidation, tidal inlet system, differential subsidence']",Earth Surface and Water,"Land subsidence is an important environmental and societal issue in the Netherlands. Lowering of the surface-level requires additional artificial drainage to maintain the current human-designated functions of the landscape such as agriculture. Moreover, during peat oxidation greenhouse gasses are emitted to the atmosphere that contribute to global warming. The Groningen gas field area in the northern Netherlands provides a good example 
of a region where various subsidence mechanisms cause a differential subsidence signal. Commercial exploitation of gas since 1963 from a porous sandstone layer at 2 to 3-kilometre depth has triggered deep compression. In addition, the shallow subsurface contains fine-grained deposits in which shallow subsidence mechanisms such as compression and peat oxidation occur. Although various studies have quantified deep compression initiated by the gas extraction, no previous study has investigated shallow subsidence in the Groningen gasfield area. The main objective of this thesis was to quantify shallow subsidence in the Groningen gasfield area since 1963 using a differential subsurface saturation state based on daily modelled groundwater levels. 
Several research strategies were combined to achieve this goal. For the selected study area in Nieuwolda, groundwater levels were modelled from 2016 till 2019 using the one-dimensional, process-based SWAP-model. After calibration, modelled groundwater levels were incorporated into a newly developed, empirical, shallow subsidence model. In this model, daily groundwater levels are used to compute differences in the subsurface saturation state through time, enabling the incorporation of seasonal or daily groundwater dynamics in the computation of peat oxidation using an exponential decay function. Additionally, shallow subsidence since 1963 is quantified by comparing historic and more recent measurements regarding lithology and surface-level. Finally, the shallow subsurface build-up was obtained by a field study in Nieuwolda and Appingedam. 
The subsidence model with incorporated groundwater level dynamics indicated an average shallow subsidence rate of 0.5 cm/year between 2016 and 2019 due to peat oxidation and (reversible) compression, which is in the same order of magnitude as subsidence measurements in this research area. Comparing the thickness of fine-grained deposits in the shallow subsurface between 1970 and 2021 yielded an average shallow subsidence rate of 0.2 cm/year. Differences in regional surface elevation measurements over time point out that the shallow subsidence rate varies between 0 and 0.9 cm/year, determined by a local, heterogeneous shallow subsurface. Modelling groundwater levels using SWAP was proven to be valuable in mimicking groundwater level dynamics, since the trend, the extremes and the mean of modelled groundwater levels match groundwater level 
measurements."
The effect of erosion resistant layers on the morphological evolution of a schematized tidal inlet system using Delft3D,"['Jas, E.R.']","['van der Vegt, M', 'van der Vegt, H']",2021-09-08T18:00:46Z,en,"['Erosion resistant layers, ERL, tidal inlet systems, morphodynamics, Delft3D, Ameland inlet system, modelling, critical shear stress for erosion, erosion rate']",Earth Surface and Water,"The Northern part of the Dutch coast is characterized by several connected tidal inlet systems. These systems are important features as
they provide coastal safety, are unique in their natural assets and are known for their recreational function. Numerical modelling is
used to predict the long-term evolution of these systems. These models do not include erosion resistant layers. These layers might play
an important role in the evolution of these systems and should therefore be properly incorporated. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
effect of these erosion resistant layers on tidal inlet systems. In addition, the representation of these layers in a model can be done by
altering the two parameters (1) Critical shear stress for erosion and (2) Erosion rate. This lead to the question; What is the
effect of different erodibility parameterizations of erosion resistant layers (ERL) on tidal inlet systems?
A literature study is conducted to derive a representative range of values for the erodibility of the ERL. These values can be determined
by using formulations that are related to soil properties. This resulted in representative values for the critical shear stress for erosion
ranging from 1.4 to 4.4. A model study, using a process-based model proposed by Dissanayake et al. (2009), is used to
evaluate the different effects of varying critical shear stress for erosion and erosion rate. There are two sets of models containing erosion resistant layer at a depth of -23 meters NAP (set 1) and -10 meters NAP (set 2). This model study covers the long-term evolution of tidal inlet systems for 80
years. Model performance analyses are used to discriminate between a phase of model adjustment and a phase of system dynamics.
Subsequently, the different implemented erosion resistant layers are analysed for their erosion behaviour.
The eventual morphological analyses aims a quantifying the effect of erosion resistant layers on both large scale system development
as small scale morphology effects. Several characteristic features are more thoroughly examined providing an insight into tidal inlet
system evolution. Especially the presence of the erosion resistant layer at a depth of - 10 meters NAP has significant morphodynamical
effects. Mainly effects on channel activity and channel geometry are observed. This is caused by differences in incision due to varying
erodibility of the erosion resistant layer. Effects on the long-term evolution of tidal inlet systems are not observed. The modelled
erosion resistant layers have predominantly a local effect. Furthermore, this thesis provides a clear overview of the effect of erosion
resistant layers, the corresponding erosion processes and the long-term evolution of tidal inlet systems in general."
Multi-criteria analysis on Sedimentation Enhancing Strategies using a best-practice based decision support tool,"['Sieben, E.']","['Jana Cox, Jaap Nienhuis']",2021-09-08T18:00:45Z,en,"['Sediment,Delta,Multi-criteria,Subsidence,Management, Strategies,Decision support tool, Analysis']",Marine Sciences,"Many deltas around the world are confronted with subsiding land and reduced sediment inflow, a problematic scenario particularly when combined with a rising sea level. To prevent drowning and to maintain the morphological functioning of the delta, sufficient sediment and an effective sediment management are crucial. Sedimentation Enhancing Strategies (SESs) concern measures that enhance natural sedimentation processes in deltas in a suitable manner.   
Many SESs are designed for local use and are case specific. Best practices and guidelines that would help to use these designs in other deltas, are lacking. The main objective of this research is to determine the suitability of an existing SES as sediment management for any other delta. Therefore, I developed a decision supporting tool that scans the applicability, merits and risks of SESs. The criteria to assess the suitability were based on a literature research and an expert consultation on case-studies from the Danube, Ems-Dollard, Ganges-Brahmaputra, Mississippi and Rhine-Meuse deltas. Adding new data in future adds to the merits of the tool; the present version is a good proof of principle.
Since the relevant aspects are multidisciplinary, the tool includes a multi-criteria analysis for an automated assessment of the applicability of existing SESs for other deltas.  The criteria that determine the applicability of SESs are local biophysical settings, presence of a levee or polder system, restricting budget, available outfall area and the primary interests of the decision maker that uses the tool. These interests concern environmental impact and the necessary or desired land use/type change. Not all criteria could be quantified in the multi-criteria analysis, for example the rate of stakeholder involvement/participation and acceptance. 
The assessment by the tool can be considered indicative since all successful Sedimentation Enhancing Strategies require taking into account site-specific considerations. This emphasises the importance of more and improving designs, pilots and/or upscale modelling of implemented or planned SESs."
"Cycling Behaviours: Minimising Travel Distance, Minimising Travel Time and Continuous Cycling","['Smit, J.']","['Maat, C.']",2021-09-08T18:00:46Z,en,"['Cycling behaviour, route choice analysis, shortest path, fastest, continuous, network analysis, route alternatives']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"Research into cycling behaviour often concludes that length is one of the most important factors in Route Choice Analysis (RCA). In contrast, RCA studies for cars find that travel time minimisation is a more important motivator. Furthermore, stated preference studies find that cyclists also prefer to 
cycle continuously. This research aims to find to what extent cyclists minimise travel distance, travel time and cycle continuously. The hypothesis is that cyclists primarily cycle to minimise travel distance, but that they deviate for a shorter travel time or to cycle continuously. To test this hypothesis, cyclists 
from in different regions in the Netherlands were asked to record their cycling behaviour for a week and to participate in a survey. Between the origins and destinations of the observed routes, labelled route alternatives were generated. Spatial and personal characteristics were added whose influence 
on cycling behaviour is tested through statistical analysis. The characteristics were selected based on what influences these cycling behaviours according to previous studies. The results show that cyclists do prioritise travel distance minimisation, despite not always taking the shortest route. This indicates 
that cyclists also prioritise other motives. However, from the results it could not be concluded that these motives were travel time minimisation and continuous cycling. This is despite the fact that the participating cyclists did state to have these motives in the survey. However, there are two exceptions. 
Firstly, men were shown to minimise travel time to some extent. Secondly, when cycling highways are present, people do seem to cycle continuously. This means that under certain circumstances travel time minimisation and continuous cycling were the main alternatives to minimising travel distance, 
but that generally this is not the case."

As a result, the sandwiched Burma terrane is expected to undergo internal deformation. Due to the obliquity of this subducting Indian plate the Burma slab is hypothesised to be subjected to (mainly) trench-parallel slab dragging. We would like to asses the current geodynamic setting of the Burma slab in the context of India-Eurasia convergence and the motion of the Burma slab and its potential indentation with Eurasia in the Eastern Syntaxis expressed in the deformation field of the crust. For this assesment we have combined GPS data from 1371 stations and applied the Spakman-Nyst method to estimate a deformation field for the Burma region. Our preferred model relies on both, fault slip and continuous deformation. Our model shows significant fault slip on the Sagaing fault and the Rakhine-Bangladesh megathrust with a strain rate in the order of 1E-7/y along the main frontal thrust and at the northern part    of the Rakhine-Bangladesh megathrust. A clockwise rotation of up to 5.7\degree/my is found for North Burma. Our results suggest uplift in the Himalayas and in the Indo-Burman ranges due to active convergence between both India-Eurasia and India-Burma,  crustal thinning across the central Tibetan plateau, and NE dragging of the Burma plate by the subducting Indian slab driving plate collision and the CW rotation of the Burma plate."

For coastal management purposes it is important to observe and quantify these changes. This is especially relevant around the North Sea as this is a low-lying area containing a variety of beach morphologies and orientations. However, it remains unknown how all the various beaches around the North Sea respond morphologically to the water and wave conditions in the North Sea. It is also unclear how these responses vary from one another and under what conditions these variations occur. Here we show that shoreline change around the North Sea is highly dependent on the site-specific circumstances and that storms are not the dominating factor determining the shoreline position. All studied sites exhibit long-term trends in shoreline position and morphological change. These trends show large variations between the different sites and are characterized by local factors such as morphology, orientation, local wave climate and coastal management strategies."

The first hypothesis expected an influence of parents’ social origin on the educational attainment of their children. It was expected that the social background of parents influences the way parents are able to navigate their children in the Dutch educational system. Secondly, two contracting hypotheses were drawn out. On the one hand, according to the Double disadvantage Hypothesis and parents' traditional gender attitudes it was expected to see a negative effect of the intersectional identities of being both women and having a non-western migration background on the relationship between social origin and educational attainment. On the other hand the Subordinate Male Target Hypothesis and the reverse gender gap imply that boys with a migration background face disadvantages of their social origin on their educational attainment. This study used data from the LISS data panel to run different linear regressions. The results show that the intersectional identities of gender and migration background do not influence the relationship between social origin and educational attainment. Overall no effect was found between social origin and education attainment however what was found was that girls have lower educational attainment then boys and that the intersectional identities of being an non-western migrant woman and a native Dutch woman has a negative influence on educational attainment compared to being a native Dutch male. These findings suggest the existence of intersectional differences, a subject that future research could look into more closely."

The regression analyses were conducted in a bootstrapped Structural Equation Model (SEM). Factor analysis yielded two dimensions for attitude towards sexual harassment in the workplace. Increased Twitter usage and being a woman leads to less tolerant attitudes for both dimensions. More exposure to content about sexual harassment leads to opposite effects for the two dimensions of attitudes towards sexual harassment in the workplace. The experience of sexual harassment predicted a less tolerant attitude towards sexual harassment in the workplace when it is assumed the harassment has taken place. Questions were raised about the validity of the operationalization of Twitter usage. This article strove to increase our knowledge of the effect Twitter has on attitudes."

SDS-stereotypes include different expectations about the sexual behavior of boys/men and girls/women. Parental SDS-attitudes can be defined as approving sexual behavior in girls and boys. Implicit SDS-stereotypes refer to stereotypes that a person is less aware of and they are better predictors of behavior than explicit SDS-stereotypes. The participants (N = 580) were high school students living in the Netherlands (M = 17.38, SD = 1.59, 41,2 % men). Participants filled out an online survey in the classroom of their school, to assess their SDS-stereotypes. The SDS-stereotypes were measured by an implicit association task (IAT). This validated task measured automatic associations between sexually active and sexually passive concepts and male and female names. Besides that, adolescents answered questions about their parents’ attitudes about the SDS, using the Scale for the Assessment of Sexual Standards among Youth (SASSY). A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed. Results indicate that parents’ SDS-attitudes did not significantly predict adolescents’ SDS-stereotypes. Adolescent gender was not a significant predictor of adolescents’ SDS-stereotypes either. This means, there is no difference in the relation between parental SDS-attitudes and SDS-stereotypes from adolescents for boys and girls. The results highlight the similarities between boys and girls in the predictors of SDS-stereotypes. Interventions focused on the SDS should therefore not distinguish between gender."

developmental language disorder (DLD) during both storybook reading and play. JE are moments of 
shared interest between parent and child, during which the parent can sensitively match the level of the 
child, so that the child can develop language and learn to interact with others. The sample consisted of 
a total of 25 toddlers, with and without a DLD, aged 24 to 48 months (M = 42.08; SD = 5.6) and one of 
their parents. The parent-child duos were filmed during five minutes of play and while reading a 
storybook. The Schlichting Receptive Language Test (SRLT) and Schlichting Expressive Language 
Test (SELT) were administered to examine the children’s language abilities. Parents and their toddlers 
with and without a DLD did not differ in their time spent in different engagement states during both 
storybook reading and play. A preliminary finding, which should be interpretated with caution, is that 
parents and their toddlers with a DLD did have briefer moments of coordinated JE during play compared 
to the typical developing toddlers. Additionally, parents and their toddlers with a DLD did not have 
briefer moments of coordinated JE during storybook reading compared to play. The results add on to 
the importance of well attuned early interventions, as shown in previous research. For future research it

Sleep is important for brain development in adolescence, and the lack of sleep has proven to have negative consequences for adolescents. Since earlier scientific literature has shown inconsistent findings on the existence of a relationship between social media use and sleep in adolescents, this study focusses on adding knowledge to the relationship between social media use and sleep in adolescents and includes ‘the fear of missing out’ as a moderator. Based on the existent literature, a negative relationship between social media use and sleep is expected, which can be positively moderated by FOMO. 404 adolescents (mean age was 13.5 years old) and their parents participated in this study. The hypotheses were tested using a regression analysis and a moderation analysis in SPSS-statistics. The results have shown that there was a significant negative relationship between social media use and sleep. Higher levels of social media use were related to lower levels of average sleep per night in adolescents. However, the effect was very small and disappeared when FOMO was added to the model. Furthermore, FOMO did not significantly moderate the relationship between social media use and sleep. Additional research is necessary to determine what other factors possibly contribute to adolescents’ sleeping patterns, since the influence of social media use on sleep wasn’t found to be very robust."

Several studies emphasize that internalizing problems can hinder the development of a clear self-concept in adolescents. The theory of the buffering model states that parental support can buffer against harmful effects, so that self-concept can still be promoted. Aim. Current longitudinal research aimed to provide information on how internalizing problems and self-concept in adolescents were related, and whether parental support moderated this relationship. Method. The research used data from the longitudinal research project RADAR. The sample consisted of 433 adolescents who had a mean age of 13 years at the first measurement. Results. The multiple regression analysis indicated that internalizing problems were a significant predictor of self-concept. Adolescents with more internalizing problems had, on average, a less clear self-concept one year later. However, parental support was not found to be a moderator. There was, however, a main effect of parental support on self-concept. For example, more parental support predicted a clearer self-concept in general. Conclusion. Internalizing problems appear to be a risk factor for the development of self-concept in adolescents. In intervention and/or treatment programs aimed at the self-concept, it is important for the effectiveness to also focus on the internalizing problems. The findings emphasize the importance of collecting scientific information about the role of parents in this process. For further research, it is recommended to operationalize parental support differently and to separate the support from fathers and mothers. In addition, it is recommended to distinguish between anxiety and depression."
The impact of parenting practices on the positive affect of young children during a pandemic.,"['Kruger, M.H.']","['Eldik, W. van', 'Duijff, S.']",2021-09-08T18:01:21Z,en,['Parents; children; positive coping; empathy; positive affect; COVID-19 exposure'],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Objective. The COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide problem affecting the lives of families and young children in the Netherlands. Research on parenting practices leading to positive outcomes in children during a pandemic hasn’t been done yet. The relevance of research on this topic lies in the importance of mental health care of children and preventive care in the future. This study investigates if two parenting practices, empathy and positive coping, are related to a positive affect of children aged one to six years old during the COVID-19 pandemic, taken exposure to COVID-19 into account. Method. Parents with children aged one to six participated through an anonymous online survey. A multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine if the parenting practices are related to the child’s positive affect. Exposure to negative events caused by the pandemic is represented in five covariates. Results. The results of the analysis are not significant F(7, 134) = 1.50, p =.38. The model explained 5% of the variance in the child’s positive affect. Discussion. Possible explanations for this outcome are the sensitivity of the positive affect scale and that less coping strategies of parents are needed when a child has more positive affect. Important limitations are the correlational design, the variables being reported by just one person and the representativeness of the research population. It can be concluded that the two parenting practices and exposure to COVID-19 are not significantly related to the child’s positive affect. In the future improved research on this topic could be done."

The group of participants consisted of 236 parents (M = 44.36 years) and 241 adolescents (M = 11.4 years). Parent and adolescent stress levels were measured using questionnaires completed by both. In addition, the adolescent completed a questionnaire related to school problems. The results of the study showed that there is an indirect and direct relation between parental stress and adolescent school problems, with adolescent stress as a mediator. However, high parental stress was not directly associated with adolescent stress. The stress experienced by the adolescent, apparent from the literature, is mainly described as social comparison with peers and pressure to perform. It is therefore recommended to conduct further research intro stress experienced in the home-situation as well as on education, for the approach to adolescent stress level. In addition, is its recommended to conduct more specific research intro the degree of stress in adolescents and the consequences this has for well-being and school performance. This provides tools for prevention and intervention programs."

Depression is one of the most prevalent disorders among adolescents. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective forms of therapy in preventing depression. Even though CBT has proven to be effective in preventing and treating (subclinical) depression in adolescents, less is known about the way it works. The STARr-project is a preventive programme for adolescents based on the CBT-components, focused on reducing depressive symptoms. STARr also studies the effectiveness of the CBT-components (cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, problem solving and relaxation) (Van den Heuvel et al., under review). The current study is part of the STAr researchproject. Aim. The current study was aimed at providing insight into the working mechanisms of CBT. Including possible mediators in a study can increase successful prevention. Professionals can then focus their practice on these parts that prove to provide change in depressive symptoms, for more treatment success. This study relates to the STARr project by investigating these proposed mediators from Van den Heuvel et al. Namely cognitive errors (for cognitive restructuring) and involvement in activities (for behavioral activation), and whether they are unique to these components. Methods. The sample consisted of adolescents aged 11 to 18 (M=13.83, 55.9% girls) which all participated in the STARr-prevention program for depression (N=222). Participants were randomly assigned to a condition, which all started with a different CBT-component. Depressive symptoms (CDI-2), cognitive errors (CNCEQ-R) and involvement in activities (BADS) were all measured before the start and after completing one component. The data was analyzed with PROCESS. Results. No mediation effects were found. However, results suggest that a change in cognitive errors and a change in involvement in activities are both predictors for a change in depressive symptoms, independently from the type of component that was used as the independent variable. Conclusions.  More research is needed to gain insight in what are the active mechanisms of CBT (Van den Heuvel et al., under review; Shirk et al., 2013). Future research should study the exact role and position of the discussed mediators within CBT."

In this research three relevant aspects related to a parental divorce were examined to predict adolescent well-being in The Netherlands. These aspects are distance between parental households, parent-adolescent contact frequency and quality of coparenting. The data in this research were used from the project ‘Where do I belong', resulting in data from N = 188 adolescents from divorced parents. Analysis consisted of multiple regression analyses to calculate the association between the separate aspects and well-being, the aspects all together and including interaction effects. The hypothesis was to find a positive association between contact frequency and coparenting and well-being, a negative association for distance between parental households and association with the interaction effects. The results showed quality of coparenting to be the strongest predictor of adolescent well-being after divorce. Distance between the parental households turned out to have the most unexpected outcome. Despite expectations and literature-study, adolescents with greater distance between parental households had higher scores on well-being. The interaction effect of coparenting and distance between parental households showed a trend significant negative association, meaning higher quality of coparenting and a bigger distance between parental household showed association with lower well-being and vice-versa. In conclusion, it can be said that the individual aspects examined in this study have limited meaning in predicting adolescent well-being after divorce. Distance between parental households after divorce and coparenting quality are closely associated. Further research could investigate the role of social economic status from parents, the degree of conflict between parents and quantity of moving between parental households."

between the implementation of rigorous user-oriented design and the pace at which 
digitalization is required. Research has shown that quantitative Human Factors research 
techniques through investigation of constructs such as Situation Awareness, can be useful, if 
not essential, to user-oriented control-room design processes. This thesis consists of two parts, 
the first of which is a conceptual framework based on a literature review, that focuses on the 
interplay between different aspects of control room design and shows how these aspects could 
be reconfigured to enable more user-oriented control-room design. The second part of this 
thesis is a case-study, which aims to investigate the advantages of integrating quantitative,
Human Factors techniques into the control-room design process by demonstrating the 
usefulness of a select range of quantitative, human factors, research techniques. Building on 
this conceptual framework, the study asks, what is the plausibility of integrating quantitative 
human factors techniques into usability research in control rooms? 
Based on a review of various quantitative situation awareness measuring techniques, a 
simulation with an existing and a novel interface for train traffic controllers was conducted, and 
quantitative data was collected to assess various metrics through eye tracking, interval popup 
queries and a series of self-report questionnaires. Analysis of the ascertained data indicates 
that eye-tracking measures are representative of situation awareness when looking at 
associations with self-report and probe query measures. The results demonstrate that 
quantitative, human factors research techniques are useful in the context of control room design 
and should be implemented more extensively. Given the results of the case study in the current 
thesis it is recommended that future research further investigates associations between 
quantitative research techniques such as eye tracking measures and probe query measures 
which assess situation awareness dynamically when investigating control room design."

Adolescents involved in a divorce appear to experience a lower general well-being and display more internalizing problems than children from intact families. Aim: This study was aimed to investigate the relation between the amount of interparental conflict, perceptions of peer belonging and internalizing problem behavior of adolescents with divorced parents. Method: A total of 188 adolescents filled out an online questionnaire. The group included 115 girls and 73 boys between the ages of 11 and 19 years old. To answer the research question, a multiple regression analysis was performed. This evaluated the main effects of interparental conflict and peer belonging on internalizing problems. Furthermore, it investigated the possibility of a correlation between interparental conflict and peer belonging. Results: Interparental conflict was significantly and positively correlated with internalizing problem behavior. Furthermore, peer belonging was significantly negatively correlated with internalizing problem behavior. Lastly, there was no significant interaction-effect of interparental conflict and peer belonging on internalizing problem behavior. Conclusion: This research shows that interparental conflict is a risk factor for internalizing problems, on the contrary peer belonging is a protective factor. Finally, peer belonging does not compensate for interparental conflict in relation to internalizing problem behavior.

The participants in the YouTube community experienced that there is a place for this in their community. However, almost no one in the TikTok community experienced this same feeling in their community.

To answer these questions, data from the DASH-project (wave 4) has been used. The sample included 53 monolingual and 82 bilingual children (Mage = 5;9, SD = 1.95). An independent t-test and multiple regression analysis via PROCESS have been used to investigate the correlations.

Rat tickling is a technique which aims to reduce handling stress. In a previous study, the effect of tickling or gentling on tail temperatures of rats was investigated, using infrared thermography. The present study analyses the behaviour of the rats from the mentioned study, to investigate possible effects of stress-related and other behaviours on tail temperature. Moreover, the effect of two different handling techniques, tickling and gentling, on behaviour was analysed. Sixteen male Wistar rats (WU:Crl) received one of the following treatments for 14 weeks: tickling (n = 8), gentling (n = 4) or no handling (control, n = 4). Mid-tail temperature was measured before, during and after manual restraint, and videos for behavioural analysis were recorded. Results showed that higher groom, scratch and rear frequencies are associated with higher tail temperatures, while no effect of freezing or huddling on tail temperature was found. Moreover, gentled rats froze less than control rats and tickled rats during the stressor, and less than control rats post-stressor. Gentled rats also huddled the most pre-stressor. Control rats spent the most time grooming pre-stressor, while they had the highest groom frequency post-stressor. Post-stressor, the average groom bout duration was longer for Tickled rats than for Gentled rats. The results of freeze durations suggest that tickling did not reduce fear in response to manual restraint, at least not in all rats. Tickling might not always be a positive experience for rats. This study is limited by its sample size, with possible cage effects influencing the results. Additional research is suggested."

This study aims to explore how engineering professionals develop employability competencies and what turnover intentions they engage in as a result of a competence development program. An instrumental case study design was used with the Architecture Competence Development Program as the case. Semi-structured interviews were held with open-ended questions to explore the participants’ experience and perceptions of employability competence development. Findings revealed that the relation between the development of employability and potential turnover intentions involves one’s interpretation of the opportunities for employability development by their employer. Furthermore, findings indicated that employability competencies are primarily developed through gaining work experience. Nevertheless, training programs add value by expediating the process of gaining experience and facilitating formal and informal networks. Therefore, for most respondents, participation in the training program has enhanced the employee-employer bond, reducing their intentions to leave."

This is misleading since they give a feeling of effectiveness but are less effective. Methods that require higher mental effort are more effective since they give better long-term results. However, high experienced effort leads to a lower feeling of effectiveness. Therefore, the relationship between perceived mental effort and perceived effectiveness was examined. How well someone monitors their learning can influence this relationship. Thereupon, it was examined if monitoring accuracy has a moderating effect on the relationship between mental effort and effectiveness. To further investigate the field of desirable difficulties, blocked and interleaved studying were examined. Interleaving is more effective than blocked practice. With a regression analysis evidence was found for the negative influence of mental effort on perceived effectiveness when studying interleaved. This means that students who have higher mental effort experience lower effectiveness. Monitoring accuracy has not been found to be a moderator but does directly influence perceived effectiveness for interleaved practice. So, students that monitor studying better think interleaving is effective.

This forces local-level stakeholders, such as schools or school boards, to come up with own solutions to increase the inflow and limit the outflow from the profession. This multiple case study is the first to explore and systematically map these local initiatives for primary education in the Netherlands in a within-case analysis of four cases, using document analysis and semi-structured interviews. The initiatives concern working in learning teams, secondary education (SE) teachers who teach pupils in primary education, SE students who assist primary school teachers and educative day programs of specialists. Following from the within-case analysis, these initiatives are described on problem definition, design of the initiative and stakeholders’ experiences. Findings show that initiatives vary widely on these three pillars, depending on the context they are operating. This makes the success of one-size-fits all national initiatives questionable and requires more alignment with local needs. Outcomes of this study and further research will allow schools, policymakers and the Inspectorate of Education to make informed decisions on what existing initiatives show promise, which should be avoided and possibly also what regulations should be adapted."
The Influence of Prior Knowledge on the Effect of Deductive and Inductive Presentation Strategies on Learning Performance,"['Lau, C.M.A. de']","['E.M. Janssen, L.

When designing training for mastering complex tasks, the Four-Component Instructional Design (4C/ID) model claims that four components are needed. One of these components is supportive information. The inductive-expository principle aligns with supportive information and states that learners with little prior knowledge should first get a concrete example before the general information is presented. However, previous studies examining the influence of prior knowledge on presentation strategies are hard to find. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of presentation strategies of supportive information on students’ learning performance and how this relation is influenced by prior knowledge. A total of 129 university students participated in 2 sessions where they were exposed to the inductive or the deductive presentation strategy. Results show no significant differences between the deductive and inductive groups with respect to learning performance. Additionally, results indicate that the effect of inductive and deductive information presentation strategies in participants’ learning performance is not influenced by the participants’ prior knowledge. It is therefore concluded that teaching with an inductive or deductive strategy has no difference on the learning performance of low prior knowledge and high prior knowledge."

Many suggestions are made on how to stimulate these capabilities, known as student feedback literacy, through educational activities. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that these activities actually develop student feedback literacy. In this study several of those activities, including using exemplars (Carless, 2020), providing and receiving peer feedback (Carless & Boud, 2018) and self-evaluation (Malecka et al., 2020) are combined in an intervention. With the use of semi-structured interviews pre- and post-intervention the effect of this intervention on the development of student feedback literacy is measured. All students showed progress in one or more features of student feedback literacy after the intervention, most of them in the appreciation and judgment feature. No one showed progress in all four features of student feedback literacy. Activities to stimulate student feedback literacy should be core elements of the curriculum, and therefore this study should be prolonged to see the effect after several interventions."

To advance insights into how FoI research can contribute to the support of adolescents' career development, it was studied how students in different stages of their career development experience engaging in SDTs as part of their career orientation. It was found that students who already had some idea of their future career plans experience the SDT as more enjoyable, less complicated and more valuable when it comes to the orientation of possible career paths than those who had no idea yet.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 academic teachers to create an understanding of teachers’ identity by exploring their self-image, task perception, and sense of competence. Findings show that for self-image and task perception there only was a shift in the way in which these aspects emerged. Teachers still think the same for self-image and task perception or even realized some aspects gained importance. However, the way they practice it differs for the online situation. Teachers’ sense of competence was not affected by ERT or was even positively affected. However, teachers did feel less competent at some moments during ERT.

"Submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing to evaluate aerobic capacity in patients with knee osteoarthritis scheduled for total knee arthroplasty: 
a feasibility study","['Kornuyt, A.C.M.']","['Lenssen, A.F.']",2021-09-03T18:01:34Z,en,"['Osteoarthritis, Knee, Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing, Feasibility.']",Fysiotherapiewetenschap,"Background     
Higher aerobic capacity before surgery possibly is prognostic for a better and faster recovery in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) scheduled for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is the gold standard to evaluate aerobic capacity; however, until now no studies have investigated the feasibility of submaximal CPET using cycle ergometry in this population. 

Aim
To investigate the feasibility of submaximal CPET in patients with knee OA scheduled for TKA surgery in three domains: 1) recruitment rate of participants who are representative of the target study population; 2) feasibility of a submaximal CPET procedure; and 3) acceptability and suitability. Furthermore, this study aimed to assess the aerobic capacity of participants using submaximal CPET indicators and to compare these results with normative values.

Methods
In this cross-sectional multi-centre feasibility study, participants with knee OA scheduled for primary unilateral TKA surgery performed a submaximal CPET following preoperative screening, three to six weeks before surgery. To examine their experiences, participants completed a questionnaire and one week later they were contacted by telephone. CPET feasibility was assessed against five criteria: 1) recruitment rate ≥20%; 2) CPET performance rate ≥90%; 3) ≥90% of participants reached the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT); 4) no serious adverse events; and 5) ≥80% of participants had a positive attitude towards CPET. Aerobic capacity was evaluated using the oxygen uptake (VO2) at the VAT and oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) . 

Results
All feasibility criteria were met: 14 representative participants were recruited (recruitment rate: 53.8%), all were able to perform the test, reached the VAT, were positive towards CPET and no serious adverse events occurred. The median VO2 at the VAT was 12.82 ml.kg-1.min-1 (IQR 11.29–13.63). The median OUES was 23.09.kg-1 (IQR 20.23–28.90), and 109.5% and 113.0% of predicted.

Conclusion and key findings
Submaximal CPET using cycle ergometry is feasible in patients with knee OA scheduled for TKA surgery to evaluate aerobic capacity. Based on these results, the exercise test can be used preoperatively to identify patients with a reduced aerobic capacity.

En outre, la motivation et l'image de soi des élèves ont également été examinées. Les élèves ont eu un total de trois leçons au cours desquelles ils se sont entraînés avec trois chansons différentes. Les résultats du prétest et du posttest ont montré qu'il n'y avait pas d'amélioration statistiquement significative des compétences d'écoute des élèves. En outre, la motivation et l'image de soi des élèves ne se sont pas non plus améliorées de façon significative.

Samenvatting
Luistervaardigheid is vaak een moeilijk onderdeel voor de moderne vreemde talen op middelbare scholen. In dit onderzoek is onderzocht of het gebruik van Franse chansons helpt bij het verbeteren van de luistervaardigheid bij leerlingen uit mavo-havo 2. De onderzoeksvraag is: Kunnen mavo-havo 2 leerlingen hun luistervaardigheid verbeteren door te oefenen met het luisteren naar Franse liedjes? 
Verder is ook gekeken naar de motivatie en het zelfbeeld van de leerlingen. De leerlingen hebben in totaal drie lessen gehad waarin ze geoefend hebben met drie verschillende liedjes. Uit de resultaten van de pretest en posttest bleek dat er geen statistisch significante verbetering is van de luistervaardigheid van de leerlingen. Verder zijn de motivatie en het zelfbeeld van de leerlingen ook niet significant verbeterd. Uit dit onderzoek is dus gebleken dat leerlingen hun luistervaardigheid niet hebben kunnen verbeteren door het oefenen van luistervaardigheid met chansons. Daarnaast zijn ook de motivatie en het zelfbeeld niet verbeterd."

This design-based research explores the development and theoretical underpinning of an informal educational product which uses XR to support children’s engagement with proteomics. Here, interactivity through gamification was chosen as the approach to achieve this heightened engagement. Field research and questionnaires were used to inform an iterative design process using rapid prototyping. This design reached a pilot evaluation stage for testing with a sample of the target audience, but further evaluation is required to draw concrete conclusion. Existing literature suggests that using XR in the context of primary biology education can help inform concept-context models as well as the formulation of structural-functional relationships. This research project develops this idea through an iterative design model, aiming to document the process as a reference to other researchers developing educational tools with XR. The final iteration of this design research can also act as a starting point for other researchers with interest in continuing with the design towards a final product."
The Impact of Public Urban Green Infrastructure on Health: a Amsterdam Case Study,"['Verwer, J.']","['van Lammeren, Dr.ir. R.J.A (Ron)']",2021-09-02T18:00:11Z,en,"['green infrastrcuture, urban green, multiple regression, Amsterdam, health']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"The objective of this study is to quantify the relation, or relationships, between public urban green infrastructure (PUGI) and citizens’ health in the municipality of Amsterdam. The results show what implications these relationships have on the (planned) PUGI of the year 2050. It is argued in many studies that increased proximity of PUGI has a significant positive impact on, among other things, the prevalence of obesity, loneliness, and mental health problems. Amsterdam has a different urban-fabric than the cities that are the focal point of existing studies (mainly north-America). The null-hypothesis is that within the municipality of Amsterdam the proximity of PUGI is less a determinant for health than in existing studies. Among the reasons to assume this is the skew division of PUGI in Amsterdam, with high-income (central) areas in general having less PUGI than lower-income (outer) areas.                                                                                  This study uses a multiple regression model to substantiate and quantify this relation or the null-hypothesis. Urban neighbourhoods, from which there are 91 in Amsterdam, are the aggregation-unit of choice; and beside PUGI several covariables are considered. The findings show that PUGI has no significant-correlation with obesity, mental health problems and loneliness. The covariables, economic-status and neighbourhood design are important explanatory variables for the health-variables. The analysis of the 2050-PUGI showed that the interventions the municipality propose strongly aim to increase the inclusion of low-SES people into the PUGI. A push which is much needed knowing that low-SES citizens are less healthy in general and make less use of PUGI. The 2050-policy additionally tries to increase the quality of the PUGI by introducing park-concierges, sport-amenities, social events, and functional-diversification of the parks (depending on the neighbourhood it is in). 								                                                                                                                                                        In conclusion, the PUGI that Amsterdam neighbourhoods have in their proximity is currently an insignificant determinator for health. Future studies could be helped by introducing new variables such as fast-food-outlets and cardiovascular diseases, which are currently not openly available on the neighbourhood-level. In addition, the 91 neighbourhoods may be too small of a sample-size for robust statistical modelling; leading to significant outliers within the sample-size that are a nuisance to the model-fit and coefficients. Using a (fine-grained) tessellated aggregation in combination with data on this level would allow for better statistical modelling and more robust outcomes. This data-precision is unavailable for Amsterdam, substantiating the choice for using the neighbourhood as aggregation."
"Exploring the Relationship Between Modes of Governance and Collective Empowerment of Grassroots Innovations in Agro-Food Sustainability Transitions: A Case Study of Urban Community Gardens in the Bronx, New York City","['Gutiérrez Ribner, B.N.']","['Giuseppe Feola, Giuseppe Feola', 'Guilherme Raj, Guilherme Raj']",2021-09-02T18:00:12Z,en_US,['Urban Community Gardens; Grassroots Innovations; Modes of Governance; Collective Empowerment: Agro-Food Systems; Sustainability Transitions'],Sustainable Development,"Capitalist industrial food systems have been widely recognized as unsustainable and have invoked calls for a sustainability transition towards a more sustainable food system (El Bilali, 2019). A systemic challenge within this industrial food system is unequal power dynamics between government, corporate actors, and civil society. Grassroots innovations offer opportunities to help (re)balance power dynamics by cultivating collective empowerment and leading social change. However, grassroots innovations have been recognized as being vulnerable to capture and translation effects by dominant regime actors (Pel, 2015). This suggests that governance dynamics be further investigated to understand if certain modes of governance influence grassroots innovations’ manifestations of collective empowerment. In this research, urban community gardens (UCG) in the Bronx, New York City, are taken as a case for grassroots innovations. Using a case study approach, four UCGs were empirically investigated to understand the relationship between modes of governance (Driessen et al., 2012) and collective empowerment (Hur, 2006). Results found that self and decentralized governance were the most common modes of governance that characterized UCGs. While there was considerable evidence of short-term government containment through top-down formal regulations (i.e., decentralized governance characteristics), this did not impede UCGs’ ability to manifest collective empowerment in the long-term. UCGs countered containment mechanisms by acting in solidarity with other civil society organizations and performing various acts of contestation. Findings suggest that characteristics of self- governance (i.e., bottom-up social learning, tailor-made goals, and self-crafted rules) contributed to all core components of collective empowerment, whereas characteristics of decentralized governance (i.e., uniform goals, formal rules, top-down interactions) only contributed to some components of collective empowerment. This research yields important societal implications which may help grassroots innovations strengthen their collective action strategies and more successfully contribute to a sustainability transition towards a more sustainable agro-food system."
Collaborative governance in mission-oriented innovation policy: Lessons learned from the German High-Tech Strategy 2025,"['Brodner, P.']","['Wanzenböck, I.']",2021-09-02T18:00:14Z,en,"['mission-oriented innovation policy, collaborative governance']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The 21st century is characterized by grand environmental and societal challenges, such as climate change or public health, stimulating national governments to revise their innovation policies by implementing missions. A mission is a well-defined goal that connects and enables stakeholders on the shared objective. With mission-oriented innovation policies (MOIP), policymakers attempt to intentionally generate a shared direction for innovation activities and guide various actors around a common goal. Therefore, a significant aim of MOIP is to enable cross-disciplinary collaboration by including actors of various groups of interest, such as civil society, industry, and local governments. 
The following research question is addressed: “How can collaborative governance be implemented in transformer missions?” Additionally, two sub-questions are posed to address hampering and facilitating factors of collaborative governance and the differences among the missions regarding the collaboration process. 
In this context, Germany has formulated twelve missions in the High-Tech Strategy 2025 (HTS) which have already been characterized. For this study, the transformer missions were analyzed because of their broad scope and complex socio-technical system that they comprehensively aim to target. A comparative case study analyzed two transformer missions, namely ‘Creating sustainable circular economies’ and ‘Substantially reducing plastic discharged into the environment’. This aim was to better understand the MOIP processes with collaborative governance. Therefore, fifteen semi-structured interviews with stakeholders connected to the two transformer missions were conducted. 
The results showed that collaborative governance in transformer missions is essential. For a better understanding, the HTS was divided into three levels: the HTS, mission, and program level. Variances among all of them were observed. While the HTS and the program levels were well structured, the mission level hardly received coordination resources. Another overall finding on mission collaboration indicated the importance of time commitment for a multi-stakeholder collaboration process. The collaborative process factors are therefore essential to maintain and not negligible. 
On the basis of these findings, the following two implications are recommended. First, the formulation phase of the mission already determines crucial factors such as scope, participation, and uptake. Therefore, early inclusion of the target groups is crucial to create MOIP. Second, each mission needs coordinative governance structures to connect stakeholders – public and private – for collaboration, leading to the aimed knowledge transmission among them and consequently spurs the endeavoured innovation."
Psychedelics & Palliative Care: A Comparative Analysis of Institutional Logics,"['Buurma, B.']","['Peine, Alex']",2021-09-02T18:00:15Z,en,[],Innovation Sciences,"The need for improved treatment options for those dealing with psychological suffering, such as end of
life anxiety and depression is critical, particularly for healthcare systems such as palliative care which
already tend to such patients. A promising new therapeutic treatment may be found in psychedelics such
as LSD and psilocybin, which have already shown encouraging results in clinical trials dealing with such
conditions. Their potential for adoption, whilst clearly significant at the macro-, and meso- level, i.e.
effects of the market and state, should also, critically, be understood on the more localised micro-level, in
that ultimately it is individuals who will adopt these practices. A useful theory with respect to this, known
as institutional logics, describes how institutional ideas manifest in everyday practice. In this paper, I
conduct a qualitative inductive methodology that draws from previous conceptualisations of institutional
logics to a) identify the multiple institutional logics present in both fields, b) explore the intra- and
inter-domain overlaps and tensions across fields, and c) suggest what these overlaps and tensions might
mean for policy makers and professionals. This cross-case comparison, itself a novel approach to the
application of this theory, was conducted through an iterative process between data collection, namely
interviews with specialists, and a theoretically driven analysis. The results showed an overlapping array of
conflicting logics between the two cases, with encouraging similarities with respect to many of the shared
norms, values, and means of operating. For one, the holistic logics, defined by its multi-dimensional
patient-centred approach to care, had a strong presence in both domains, as well as a comparable presence
of two scientifically backed professional logics: the medical, and research logics. Intra-domain tensions
were also consistent, mainly between the professional logics and a business-like managerial logic. A key
finding, and stumbling block in the legitimisation of psychedelics, is the presence of what I define as a
psychedelic logic, where issues of objectivity, and the misalignment of goals were established. This
embryonic logic, mostly composed of cultural-cognitive elements, I argue will be a key factor in the
legitimising process, either by aligning itself with more established logics, or becoming more established
through activist powers. All in all, insights from this paper suggest encouraging overlaps with respect to
the micro-level dynamics of these domains, which is important for the fact that psychedelic therapy may
one day become part of the palliative arsenal that deals with serious psychological suffering."

representations of their body size and shape. This distortion is caused by primed processing of
perceptual information, leading to an overestimated body image and an overestimated body

Regarding this study, reduced activation within regions of the PPC, like the precuneus and
IPL, the MFG, and the RSC was expected in AN compared to HC. Other-body size perception
was included as an additional variable to test the assumption that distorted body-size
perception is limited to the own body in AN. In the present study, an ALE meta-analysis was
conducted. In total, 15 fMRI-studies were included, 11 studies regarding self-body size
perception, and eight studies regarding other-body size perception. Cluster analyses, contrast
analyses, and conjunction analyses were conducted by using BrainMap GingerALE. Results
showed no difference in activation during self-body size perception between AN and HC.
During other-body size perception, AN patients showed increased activation in the right
SPL/precuneus. This ALE meta-analysis provided evidence that neural activation in AN and
HC might be similar during self-body size perception. However, AN patients might
experience problems in processing other female bodies. Still, further research will be
necessary to investigate the neural basis of self-body size perception in AN more closely.
Especially, neural processes during proprioception and interoception, the vestibular system as
well as resting-state functional connectivity should be explored in AN."

A considerable group of persons develop a depression after the injury. Contrary to the literature in the general population, research on the personality traits that could influence the development of depression in this population is sparse. Therefore, several correlations between personality traits and depressive symptoms have been conducted. Afterwards, a multiple regression and a hierarchical regression were conducted to see if personality traits were predictors of depressive symptoms when injury characteristics are controlled. Neuroticism and Self-Esteem are significantly correlated with depressive symptoms. In the regression analyses, Neuroticism was found to be a significant predictor of variance in the development of depressive symptoms.

Further research is needed to assess the complex relationship between personality and depressive symptoms."

De hoofdvraag luidt of er sprake is van een historische traditie, waarin het standpunt van de Nederlandse regering betreffende de Armeense kwestie onveranderd blijft. Daarbij wordt er voor elke periode gebruik gemaakt van verschillende primaire bronnen. Deze primaire bronnen bestaan uit rapportages van de Nederlandse gezant P.J.F.M. van der Does de Willebois, Nederlandse krantenartikelen uit Trouw, NRC Handelsblad, De Telegraaf, De Volkskrant en Het Parool, en parlementaire documenten waaronder het parlementaire debat rondom de Turkse toetredingsonderhandelingen tot de Europese Unie. Het onderzoek wordt uitgevoerd in de vorm van een discoursanalyse waarin de focus wordt gelegd op termen als ‘massamoord’, ‘volkerenmoord’ en ‘genocide’.
Het onderzoek concludeert dat er in zekere zin sprake is van een historische traditie. De discussie over de Armeense kwestie is geen nieuw fenomeen. Het onderwerp heeft minstens drie keer op de Nederlandse publieke en/of politieke agenda gestaan en telkens met een ander verloop. Hoewel het verloop van de drie periodes verschillend was, bleef de uitkomst hetzelfde: de regering erkent de Armeense kwestie niet."
Sympathie voor de duivel,"['Sittert, I. van']","['Olesen, C.']",2021-09-07T18:00:57Z,nl,"['structure of sympathy, Lucifer, cognitieve theorie, sympathie, tekstuele analyse, televisieserie']",Media en cultuur,"In dit onderzoek is de manier waarop Lucifer sympathie opwekt voor een moreel ambigue protagonist geanalyseerd. De hoofdvraag die is beantwoord, is: Hoe komt de structure of sympathy tot stand in Lucifer door middel van het gebruik van een moreel ambigue protagonist? Aan de hand van Murray Smiths structure of sympathy is geanalyseerd hoe de serie de morele evaluatie van kijkers probeert te beïnvloeden door middel van sympathie. De analyse is gebaseerd op cognitieve filmtheorie en is toegepast op drie afleveringen uit het eerste seizoen van Lucifer. Er is een tekstuele analyse uitgevoerd op segmenten uit deze afleveringen met behulp van een shot-voor-shotprotocol. Hierbij is ingegaan op hoe de serie alignment stimuleert, hoe Lucifer allegiance aanmoedigt en hoe de vorm en het narratief van de serie samen met de twee eerste elementen samenwerken om sympathie op te wekken. 
Door Lucifers emoties toegankelijk te maken voor het publiek door middel van close-ups en toepasselijke, melodramatische muziek, stimuleert de serie begrip voor en alignment tot de antiheld. Doordat toeschouwers Lucifer hierdoor beter begrijpen, kunnen ze zijn immorele gedrag in de juiste context plaatsen en een allegiance tot hem vormen, wat verzachtend werkt voor de morele evaluatie. Ze vergeven zijn moreel foute acties makkelijker omdat ze begrijpen dat hij zich gekwetst voelt. Door de lengte van het narratief krijgen kijkers de mogelijkheid een band te vormen met Lucifer waardoor ze ook zijn goede kanten kunnen leren kennen om zijn slechte kanten te kunnen nuanceren. Een langdurig narratief blijkt ook voordelig om elementen die sympathie opwekken (zoals slachtofferschap) in het verhaal te verwerken. 
Dus dankzij het stimuleren van alignment, het aansporen van een allegiance en een langdurig narratief ontwikkelen toeschouwers een band met de antiheld, die als basis wordt gebruikt om sympathie voor Lucifer op te wekken ondanks zijn moreel onwenselijke gedrag. De analyse heeft bewezen dat Lucifer door middel van de structure of sympathy sympathie weet te genereren voor een antiheld die moreel imperfect is. Naar aanleiding hiervan en op basis van andere onderzoeken zou nu onderzocht kunnen worden hoe de structure of sympathie van toepassing is op andere antihelden. Daarna kan worden onderzocht of er een limiet bestaat voor de band die toeschouwers met een antiheld voelen, en of deze band onherstelbaar beschadigd zou kunnen worden of niet."

In deze performance is Abramović’s fysieke lichaam vervangen door een holografische versie. Deze afwezigheid van het lichaam vormt een contrast met haar eerdere werken, die qua thematiek vaak draaien om lichamelijkheid en aanwezigheid. Een voorbeeld hiervan is haar performance The Artist is Present (2010), waarin ze gedurende drie maanden elke dag aanwezig was in het MoMA en toeschouwers de kans gaf om tegenover haar plaats te nemen. Aan de hand van deze twee performances heb ik middels een dispositief-analyse onderzoek gedaan naar de verschillende manieren waarop co-presence, het al dan niet fysieke samenkomen van twee mensen, geconstrueerd wordt. Eerst is het wetenschappelijke discours rondom de (on)mogelijkheid van virtuele aanwezigheid en de manieren waarop onze perceptie van fysieke aanwezigheid ontstaat besproken, gevolgd door de invloed van documentatie op de betekenisgeving van een performance, en het dispositief als methode. Door de onderdelen technologie, tekst en toeschouwer in beide performances geïsoleerd te onderzoeken is er vervolgens geanalyseerd wat de individuele effecten van deze onderdelen zijn op de constructie van co-presence. Aan de hand van het besproken discours en deze analyse is er geconcludeerd dat er in The Life een nieuwe vorm van co-presence wordt gefaciliteerd waarin de afwezigheid van Abramović niet afdoet aan co-presence, maar juist de mogelijkheid voor een nieuw begrip hiervan mogelijk maakt. Aan de andere kant wordt in The Artist is Present de nadruk zo sterk gelegd op de aanwezigheid van Abramović dat de andere factoren die een rol spelen in de totstandkoming van co-presence, zoals de context van de performance en voorkennis van de toeschouwer, genegeerd worden. Er wordt geconcludeerd dat The Life door zijn virtuele natuur niet alleen een nieuwe en virtuele vorm van co-presence toont, maar ook vraagtekens zet bij de inherentie die vaak met fysieke co-presence wordt geassocieerd."
Belichaamd begrip: de rol van image schemas in het begrijpen van Mulholland Drive,"['Fekkes, M.N.']","['Pafort-Overduin, Clara']",2021-09-07T18:00:58Z,nl,"['cognitieve filmtheorie, image schemas, top-down, bottom-up']",Taal- en cultuurstudies,"In dit onderzoek wordt onderzocht wat de rol van image schemas is in de manier waarop de kijker de film MULHOLLAND DRIVE begrijpt. Om dit te bereiken wordt gebruikgemaakt van twee methoden uit de cognitieve filmtheorie die op het eerste oog tegenover elkaar staan. De eerste methode is de top-down georiënteerde methode van David Bordwell en Kristin Thompson die zich richt op schemata en inference making. De tweede methode is gebaseerd op de recent ontstane embodied cognition thesis en richt zich op bottom-up processen en image schemas. In het onderzoeken van de manier waarop de kijker de complexe film MULHOLLAND DRIVE probeert te begrijpen, wordt gebruikgemaakt van een aanpak waarin de twee methoden worden gecombineerd. Eerst wordt aan de hand van de proairetische en de hermeneutische lijn geanalyseerd waar het zwaartepunt in complexiteit in de film ligt en hoe de kijker volgens de theorie van Bordwell en Thompson de film kan interpreteren middels inference making. Ten tweede wordt aan de hand van image schemas onderzocht hoe het lichaam van de kijker middels een automatisch proces van waarneming hem kan ondersteunen in het vormen van een interpretatie. Uit beide analyses resulteert eenzelfde interpretatie, en blijkt dat de moeilijkheid van het begrijpen van de film ligt in het contrast tussen de twee delen waar de film uit bestaat. Het verticality en centrum-periferie image schema kunnen de kijker op belichaamde wijze ondersteunen om dit contrast te begrijpen op een manier die aansluit op de uit de eerste analyse voortgekomen interpretatie. Zo blijkt dat de kijker niet alleen middels een top-down proces van inference making de film begrijpt, maar dat zijn lichaam ook een rol speelt in het proces van begrijpen. De twee methoden staan niet tegenover elkaar maar bieden elkaar juist een waardevolle aanvulling wanneer ze samen ingezet worden en kunnen helpen in het verwerven van bredere en diepere inzichten over de manier waarop de kijker een film begrijpt."

Costume as Communication in Cable Girls: A Semiotic Analysis of a Spanish Period Drama,"['Ninzoli Enderlin, G.']","['Badenoch, A. W.']",2021-09-07T18:01:00Z,en,['Costumes; period drama; Spanish drama; semiotic analysis; female characters'],Media en cultuur,"Costume in period drama represents a crucial element as it is through costumes, amongst other components, that the show manages to evoke the time period it portrays. It is well established that the historical accuracy of the show depends on the costumes. However, some scholars have identified other purposes for costumes that far exceed the historical representation. Roland Barthes first stated the connection between systems of signification based on signs and the fashion system, which he claimed being a metaphor of language. More recently, the discourses around fashion expanded and deviated from Barthes’ conception where fashion depends on language towards the idea that clothes convey meanings within their visual objects (i.e., colours, shape, fabric, etc.). These meanings have been discussed to be embedded in fashion choices that derive from social and cultural tradition. According to Pam Cook, costume in period drama can be historically credible or unfaithful. However, behind the choice of deviating from more accurate representations there are specific meanings. This analysis focuses on the meanings behind these choices. On the basis of Barthes’ idea, this research regards elements of the costumes of the Netflix series CABLE GIRLS as communicative of meanings, in particular colours, accessories, make-up, and clothing style. Moreover, it shows how the series creates the tension between the historical accuracy and the need to communicate to viewers. By answering the question “how do the costumes in the Netflix series CABLE GIRLS contribute to the construction of the female characters?” through a semiotic analysis and an initial textual examination, this research argues how costumes communicate something about the characters and work around this tension."

Over half of the world population lives in cities and this will only become more. Cities can be seen as the main polluters and the main victims of climate change, but also as leaders for climate action. These leaders are willing to start tackling climate change, especially trough making ambitious climate policy through target setting. However, cities differ greatly in how ambitious their climate policy and climate targets are. While more physical and social aspects of cities and their relation to climate policy are covered in literature, governance related variables are less researched. This research focuses on what governance conditions explain variation in ambition in urban climate policy terms of target setting. This is done by conducting a fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) using three conditions explaining whether a city is ambitious in its climate policy or not. The conditions assessed are whether a city is collaborating with international climate networks, whether the mayor of the city is left-wing oriented, and whether the emission data of the city is up-to-date. To what extent a city is collaborating with international climate networks is analyzed by their membership to C40, ICLEI and GCoM. Expected is that all three conditions together lead to ambitious climate policy in terms of target setting. Using a carefully selected selection of 64 cases, the fsQCA is conducted. The main finding is that high collaboration in combination with up-to-date data or left-wing oriented mayor in combination with up-to-date data are sufficient for the outcome. Up-to-date data is a necessary condition for ambitious climate policy. The three conditions together, however, are not sufficient for the outcome."
Jan van Arkel: Prince-Bishop during the Black Death,"['Vermaak, F.']","['Mostert, M.']",2021-09-07T18:01:01Z,en,[],History,"This thesis is about Jan van Arkel, prince-bishop of Utrecht during the Black Death (1346-1353). I ask how the prince-bishop of Utrecht response to the Black Death was depicted in ecclesiastical and narrative sources, specifically in diocesan synods, charters in the name of the bishop, and later chronicles detailing the life of the bishop. This is important research because the Black Death in Utrecht has not yet been researched in-depth, and because there is a debate on whether, and for what reason, the Low Countries did not write about the Black Death as much as other regions. My approach to these problems is to evaluate a single person’s context and responses to the Black Death, rather than big data. I found that Jan van Arkel’s behaviour before the Black Death was often about increasing his authority and imposing public order on the diocese. Accordingly, during the Black Death he responded to the plague by creating an administrative tool to oversee future outbreaks, and tailor-made rules for a plague-stricken monastery. Narrative sources also presented him as a strong leader, detailing his military victories, survival of hardships, and his revenge on his enemies."

Dit kleine condominium, ontstaan door een grensconflict, werd bestuurd door het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en Pruisen. Na 1830 zou België de positie als partner binnen het condominium van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden overnemen, maar de bijzondere status van het gebied bleef bestaan. Langzaamaan begon de bevolking zich steeds meer te identificeren met deze status.

Verschillende prominente inwoners van Moresnet trachtten deze identificatie te bevorderen. Eén van manieren om dit te proberen te bereiken was de poging van Wilhelm Molly en Gustave Roy, in de periode van 1908 tot 1909, om van Moresnet ’s werelds eerste Esperantostaat te maken, genaamd Amikejo. Vertrekkende vanuit het idee dat taal een belangrijke rol kan spelen als identificatiemiddel probeerden zij het gebied zichzelf te laten identificeren aan de hand van het Esperanto. De vraag is echter of deze identificatie ook plaats kan vinden wanneer een taal, die geen lange geschiedenis heeft in een gebied, ingevoerd wordt als nationale taal. Deze vraag staat centraal in dit onderzoek.

De bedenker van het Esperanto, Ludwig Zamenhof, was afkomstig uit een liberaal gezin. Hierdoor zien we veel liberale ideeën terug in het Esperanto. In dit onderzoek is daarom gekozen voor een liberale invalshoek. Door het bekijken van publicaties uit liberale kranten uit Nederland en België (die als buurlanden bekend waren met de bijzondere status van het gebied) is gekeken hoe de liberale pers tegen het uitroepen van Amikejo in 1908-1909 aan keek en in hoeverre het Esperanto gebruikt werd als identificatiemiddel. De conclusie van het onderzoek is dat het Esperanto niet voldeed als identificatiemiddel ten
opzichte van de buurlanden. De binding van de taal met het gebied was te artificieel om dit te bewerkstelligen. Wanneer men het gebied al als onafhankelijk zag kon de taal deze perceptie wel versterken, maar als onafhankelijkheidsverklaring an sich werd het in de buitenlandse pers niet gezien. Daarnaast kan uit de bronnen geconcludeerd worden dat ook de politieke motieven van buurlanden een grote rol speelden. Door de belangen die de Belgische overheid nog had in het gebied en de sterke band tussen diezelfde overheid en het liberalisme zien we dat de Belgische liberalen, in tegenstelling tot wat verwacht zou worden, het uitroepen van Amikejo niet als iets positiefs zagen."
Pronkstuk en kennisbron: De levensgeschiedenis van het Leidse Aratea-handschrift,"['Schrijver, M.D.']","['Hoogenboom, A.M.E.L.']",2021-09-07T18:01:24Z,nl,[],Taal- en cultuurstudies,"Het negende-eeuwse Leidse Aratea-handschrift (Voss. lat. Q. 79), dat vermoedelijk is vervaardigd aan het hof van Lodewijk de Vrome, wordt tegenwoordig beschouwd als een topstuk in de collectie van de universiteitsbibliotheek van Leiden. Het handschrift bevat naast tekst namelijk 39 bladzijden met kostelijke miniaturen. De reis die de Leidse Aratea heeft afgelegd om tot die positie te komen, wordt in dit onderzoek belicht aan de hand van de volgende vraag: Hoe veranderde de functie en betekenis van de Leidse Aratea van de negende eeuw tot op heden? Vanuit de theorie van “het leven van objecten” zijn de sociale, wetenschappelijke en culturele ontwikkelingen waar de Leidse Aratea deel van uitmaakte geanalyseerd. Binnen dat theoretische kader is ook de relatie tussen mensen die met het handschrift in contact kwamen en de Leidse Aratea belicht. De nadruk ligt in dit onderzoek op het bestuderen van de miniaturen. Zo draagt dit onderzoek bij aan onze kennis van de totstandkoming van de relatie tussen mensen en een kunstobject in uiteenlopende tijden. Voor de reconstructie van de levensgeschiedenis van de Leidse Aratea is onder andere een analyse gedaan van de gebruikssporen, zoals gerestaureerde elementen of de toevoeging van stukjes tekst. Bovendien spelen kopieën in dit onderzoek een belangrijke rol. Op meerdere punten in de geschiedenis zijn namelijk afstammelingen van de Leidse Aratea ontstaan. Deze zijn in kunsthistorisch onderzoek nog weinig met het Leidse handschrift vergeleken. De levensgeschiedenis is opgedeeld in levensfases, waarbinnen vervolgens de voornaamste belevenissen en rolveranderingen zijn aangeduid. In de Karolingische periode waarin de Leidse Aratea het levenslicht aanschouwde diende het als pronkstuk en kennisbron. Voor de daaropvolgende eeuwen zijn er weinig aanwijzingen dat het handschrift werd gebruikt als pronkstuk, totdat het in de twintigste eeuw ging schitteren in tentoonstellingen en er wereldwijde aandacht voor het handschrift was vanwege de kleurrijke miniaturen. Als kennisbron ontwikkelde de Leidse Aratea zich van een sterrencatalogus in het middeleeuwse onderwijsprogramma, naar een bron over de klassieke oudheid in de zeventiende eeuw, tot een historische materiële bron voor moderne wetenschappers. Het publiek dat kennis kon nemen van de Leidse Aratea werd in de loop van de tijd steeds minder exclusief, door middeleeuwse kopieën die naar het handschrift werden gemaakt, de in druk gebrachte variant uit de zeventiende eeuw, het facsimile uit de twintigste eeuw, en de recente gedigitaliseerde versie. Maar als neveneffect van deze ontwikkeling wordt het originele manuscript nu meer dan ooit afgeschermd en leidt het een kluizenaarsbestaan in het depot van de universiteitsbibliotheek van Leiden."

This study has regarded Christopher’s personal writings: his journal, letters to friends, notes in margins of books he owned and a graffito inside his place of residence in Alaska. By dissecting the concept of wilderness through nature theory, analysing and interpreting the literary choices in the writings of McCandless and relating them to psychological theory, this study has constructed a contextual framework for the contents of McCandless’s writings. By relating these findings to his written accounts, and introducing additional theory by Abraham Maslow and Gary Snyder, among others, this study has constructed a multidimensional interpretation of his understandings. The results of the analyses show that Christopher McCandless’s created a romanticized ideal of wilderness, not rooted in reality, but based on the writings of literary heroes, his own need to separate from society and the ambiguity of the concept of wild nature. This ideal of wilderness was to aid him in the rejection and ‘death’ of his old, socially imposed, self, and the emersion of a ‘true self;’ a transformation that was to match the writings of his literary heroes."

Existing research into memes already explored how memes should be defined, the community they create, and the political potential internet memes have, showing the influence memes have in modern society. However, music memes are much less studied, especially the question why certain music is used. This thesis is a deep dive into the subgenre of music memes. It theorizes criteria that music must fulfil to be useable for memes. Roughly, music memes can be put into two categories: memes that have old music and a new meme format or new music that uses an old format. To properly analyze why certain music is used for memes this thesis employs theories about ubiquitous listening, decontextualization, and participation culture. Applying these theories results in several external and internal characteristics that explain why certain musical pieces are used more for YouTube music memes than others. While the thesis analyses general music meme trends from the last five years, the specific objects of study are Crazy Frog memes and Morshu beatboxes. Most of these find their origin on YouTube but are also shared across many other media platforms. This thesis sheds some much-needed light on the specific workings of the internet meme culture, because the memes start coming and they don’t stop coming."

Previous research has shown the worries of the Dutch government concerning the financial and social problems the Chinese supposedly posed and consequently they were systematically excluded from Dutch society. In Dutch media, specifically newspaper articles, the Chinese immigrant was both positively as negatively presented. Despite some negative accounts, the overall attitude in the newspaper articles was definitely not as negative as the attitude of the Dutch government was. The issues the Dutch authorities had concerning the Chinese immigrants were therefore not always shared by the Dutch public."

De film wordt in de narratieve structuur gekenmerkt door een onbetrouwbaar vertelperspectief, wat bijdraagt aan de grimmige sfeer van Joker doordat het de krankzinnigheid van de protagonist geleidelijk aan het licht brengt. De narratieve structuur werkt samen met en wordt ondersteund door verschillende stijlelementen in de film. Binnen dit geheel van stijlelementen sprongen naar mijn mening de opvallende belichtingselementen eruit die een verband hebben met de graduele karaktertransitie van het hoofdpersonage. Belichting is een belangrijke sfeermaker binnen de mise-en-scène van Joker en werd de ingang om in meer detail naar deze film te kijken in relatie tot de narratieve structuur van de vertelling. De onderzoeksvraag die is onderzocht luidt als volgt: Welke rol speelt mise-en-scène en specifiek belichting bij het proces dat de onbetrouwbare protagonist Arthur Fleck in de psychologische puzzelfilm Joker (2019) doormaakt en dat leidt tot zijn transformatie in ‘de Joker’? Deze vraag is beantwoord door het uitvoeren van een neoformalistische filmanalyse waarbij belichting (binnen de grotere structuur van mise-en-scène) als device centraal stond. Eerst is gefocust op hoe het onbetrouwbare vertelperspectief tot uitdrukking komt en welke functie dit vervult binnen de grotere narratieve structuur van de film. Hierbij is Joker bestempeld als een psychologische puzzelfilm en is geconcludeerd dat het onbetrouwbare vertelperspectief zowel kan uitnodigen tot distantie als compassie voor de protagonist. Dit vertelperspectief staat in dienst van het intensiveren van Arthur’s innerlijke belevingswereld, waardoor de toeschouwer wordt uitgenodigd zich meer met het hoofdpersonage te engageren ondanks diens geleidelijk groeiende radicalisering. De sequenties met Arthur’s gefantaseerde optreden in de talkshow van zijn idool Murray Franklin en Arthur’s daadwerkelijke optreden in Murray’s talkshow zijn onderzocht, omdat deze de karaktertransitie van de protagonist kristalliseren. Hierbij is op te merken dat de mise-en-scène en specifiek belichting wordt afgestemd op Arthur’s focalisatie, aangezien deze worden gevormd naar de gemoedstoestand die de protagonist op dat moment ervaart. De filmstijl ondersteunt de vertelling en benadrukt tevens de intensiteit van deze vertelling. De belichting speelt hierbij een cruciale rol in de karaktertransitie van de protagonist. Deze uitgevoerde filmanalyse van Joker (2019) demonstreert de kracht van belichting binnen deze specifieke filmvertelling, waardoor het een bijdrage levert aan het nog beperkte kennisveld omtrent belichting. Een concrete belichtingstheorie ontbreekt volgens filmprofessor Torben Grodal, maar belichting is voor het medium film wel van wezenlijk belang aangezien het één van de krachtigste middelen is om gevoelens en stemmingen op te wekken en te veranderen bij de toeschouwer. Hopelijk kan filmbelichting binnen mise-en-scène een meer vooraanstaande positie genieten in toekomstige filmonderzoeken, aangezien het, zoals in deze masterthesis geïllustreerd, de betekenislagen binnen de zogenoemde ‘unassuming art’ van mise-en-scène verder blootlegt en aantoont hoe onlosmakelijk de narratieve structuur verbonden kan zijn met stijlelementen."

Large-Scale Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are emerging as key technologies to support the VRES integration and the reliability, flexibility, and sustainability of power systems. Understanding the value, revenue streams, and implications of Large-Scale deployment of ESS is important for investors, policy makers, and market regulators to assess their potential role in the current and future power systems as well as to better promote their deployment and integration. 

The present study aimed to add to the discussion by assessing how large-scale ESS affect the social economic welfare (SEW) in the present and future wholesale electricity markets by studying its effect under different VRES penetration levels. In order to answer the research question, the present study modelled the Belgian Day Ahead (DA) wholesale electricity market-clearing in which the existing Pumped Hydro Electricity Storage (PHES) capacity was simulated next to different sizes of large-scale Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) for varying VRES shares. To achieve the previous, a model incorporating multiple merchant-owned large-scale ESS into the DA wholesale electricity market was developed considering two perspectives: the ESS players´ and the Market Operator´s. For the former, the price-maker ESS players´ bidding strategy was modelled as a bilevel optimization with the objective of profit maximization. For the latter, the DA market was cleared in a SEW-maximizing way based on the bids submitted by the generators, consumers and ESS players, obtaining the market-clearing prices and the traded quantity.  
For each simulated scenario, the SEW, producer surplus, consumer surplus, and ESS Net Revenue were calculated.  The difference in the resulting SEW and shifts in consumer and producer surplus were then analysed. 

The results showed that large-scale ESS can have a significant impact for all market participants of the electricity market in comparison to the no storage case by levelling the differences in the on-peak and off-peak Market Clearing Price (MCP) and avoiding the use of expensive generation. With the increasing VRES participation in the generation mix, ESS systems have the potential of significantly improving the SEW by levelling the extreme maximum and minimum prices caused by the daily cycles of the solar generation. 

Regarding the effects of the price-maker ESS operation, the research found that the price-maker ESS player’s profit maximizing objective does not always align with the optimal solution from the SEW perspective and can lead to limited use of the storage capacity."

inspiración del largometraje. Con este fundamento, primero, se ha establecido que la no
fiabilidad se centra en la perspectiva, la del protagonista. Esta perspectiva se ha realizado por
utilizar diferentes recursos cinematográficos, el toma POV y la connotación de la cámara.
Además, se puede determinar tres factores que atribuyen a la valoración de no fiable: el

Om deze vraag te kunnen beantwoorden, vertrek ik vanuit de theorie van Bill Nichols, een sleutelauteur op het gebied van documentaires. Nichols betoogt dat documentaires geen reproducties, maar representaties van de werkelijke wereld zijn. Documentaires construeren volgens Nichols een perspectief op de werkelijke wereld door middel van retorische middelen. Daarnaast beschrijft Nichols dat elke documentaire een voice heeft. Dit concept wordt gezien als het perspectief van de documentairemaker op de kwestie die hij toont binnen zijn film. Door middel van deze theorie zal ik een retorische analyse uitvoeren op de documentaire EUTHANASIE DE MOVIE. Binnen deze documentaire deelt het team van BOOS hun perspectief op euthanasie bij jongeren door het volgen van twee personages die beide een euthanasiewens hebben. In mijn analyse bestudeer ik drie retorische middelen vanuit de klassieke retorica, namelijk arrangement, style en invention.
In EUTHANASIE DE MOVIE worden twee jonge hoofdpersonages gevolgd die beide euthanasie willen krijgen. Het team van BOOS laat een evenwichtig perspectief op euthanasie zien door verschillende standpunten, emoties en problemen binnen het proces van euthanasie aanvragen te belichten. Door twee verschillende ziektebeelden als gelijken weer te geven worden beide kanten van het debat rondom euthanasie vertegenwoordigd. Dit wordt versterkt door de stemmen van verschillende deskundigen die de vragen die opkomen gedurende de documentaire duidelijk beantwoorden en behapbaar maken. Uit mijn retorische analyse blijkt dat het team van BOOS verschillende retorische middelen gebruikt om een evenwichtige representatie van euthanasie neer te zetten en de kijker wil overtuigen dat euthanasie bij jongeren niet als zwaar gezien moet worden, maar als vredige dood."
Deconstruction and the Promise of Hospitality to the Other: Prolegomena to a Theory of Deconstruction,"['Salemink, P.D.M.']","['Lievers, M.']",2021-09-07T18:01:35Z,en_US,['Jacques Derrida; deconstruction; promise; hospitality; other'],Filosofie,"Anyone who has read anything about, or from, Jacques Derrida, will probably have come into contact with his most known concept: deconstruction. Finding out what it really entails, however, is not as easy. Many describe deconstruction as, for example, a theory or method (often: of destruction), which Derrida himself strongly opposed. Due to the “logocentric condition” of western culture we are wound up with the (according to Derrida: deceptive) idea that language is an ultimate description of reality, and, thus, that we can define concepts unambiguously and clearly. How, then, are we supposed to give meaning to the word ‘deconstruction’––how can we properly present the meaning of a concept, when the “meaning” of this concept is exactly the incomprehensibility of meaning? However problematic it might seem if we want to find out what deconstruction entails, this incomprehensibility of meaning is precisely the problematic which Derrida wishes to highlight by means of deconstruction. Hoping to provide some clarification on the idea of deconstruction, we will follow Derrida’s deconstructions of three concepts important throughout his oeuvre: hospitality, the promise, and the other. I will conclude by proposing a “theory of deconstruction.” Not proposing the theory, but rather a theory of deconstruction––a suggestion of one of the (many) imaginable theories of deconstruction: a theory of deconstruction as the promise of hospitality to the other."

However, mimicry in itself is also apparent among humans, both conscious and unconscious. People mimic mannerisms and behaviour as a part of social interaction. Examples of behaviour that can be imitated are social and gender norms. This thesis shows that protective mimicry, as a conscious imitation of social and gender norms for survival purposes, is present in young adult dystopian literature. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, Divergent by Veronica Roth, and  Shatter Me by Tahereh Mafi were analysed to support this thesis statement. A tentative claim is made that a trend can be observed in these novels of this behaviour. This trend coincides with character development of the female protagonists, resulting in the heroines obtaining a better understanding of their values."

This thesis analyses time and temporality, focusing on the possibility in difference between time as it is objectively known to pass and time as it is subjectively experienced. The thesis will do this by asking the question of how the concept of time functions in and adds to the story as presented in Hamlet. The analysis will in part be linked to the broad concepts of grief, mourning, memory and trauma.
	The thesis does so by close-reading the text of Hamlet and comparing objective and subjective time, uncovering the sometimes perceived as incoherent modes of time in Hamlet. The difference in objective and subjective time is then further expanded upon in light of the subjective experience of a traumatic death, mourning and time. This results in a conclusion that views the multiplicity of time in Hamlet not as problematic but as a possible addition to the experience of the themes of grief and mourning present in the play."

In this thesis we explore two separate machine learning methods for two different type of GW signals. The first being a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for the detection of GW from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Our results here corroborate those of previous work done, where we were able to identify signals from a phenomenological template bank and numerical 3D simulations of CCSNe with similar efficiencies and false alarm rates. 
For the second method we construct two fully connected neural networks that are equivalent to the traditional matched filtering approach based on previous work for the detection of GW signals generated by Compact Binary Coalescences (CBCs). These networks can theoretically approach the performance of an optimal classifier with knowledge of a prior of the parameter distribution. By training these networks on training data consisting of real LIGO data and simulated injections of GW signals we can outperform the basic matched filter and even approach the theoretically predicted optimal classifier."

Tanks are lake like structures with various uses, and institutional arrangements to govern them. In recent years there has been a reappraisal of tanks, as a means of storage, percolation and insurance against droughts and floods. Both government and socially embedded organizations, initiated rehabilitation schemes, introducing new institutions in tank settings.
This research focused on the implications of the introduction of these rehabilitation schemes on the development of institutional arrangements in tank settings. This was done through two extensive case studies of tank settings in which rehabilitation took place. These findings were supported by interviews with experts and members of socially embedded organizations and finally the review of relevant literature on the topic, region, and the historical development of tanks.
The results of this study indicated that the effect of schemes by bureaucratic and socially embedded institutions for sustainability and equitability in local settings are mixed. Sustainability for the productivity of the resource is questionable and schemes gloss over inequities. The findings shed light on the institutional plurality and complexity of institutions in tank settings. Actors with multiple identities mobilize various arrangements to legitimize and change their rights to water. Institutions are altered and adapted in local settings through relationships of power among subjects, creating both intended and unintended outcomes.
I argue for the inclusion of multiple uses and the consideration of ideological and cultural identities that underpin claims for non-subtractive rights to water, to inform institutional analysis, through the method of institutional bricolage. This supports comprehensive analysis of institutional arrangements in CPR settings, towards better adjusted policies, and sustainable and equitable CPRs."
Parton and Jet characterisation of gluonsplittings to heavy quarks in pp collisions using PYTHIA and VINCIA,"['Lourens, Y.']","['Verweij, M.']",2021-09-07T18:02:11Z,en,[],Natuur- en Sterrenkunde,"Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes the interaction between gluons and quarks, together called partons.  Unfortunately the behaviour of the partons cannot be directly measured  by  a  detector.   The  Quark–Gluon  Plasma  (QGP),  created  in  high-energy nuclear  collisions,  can  be  studied  by  measuring  the  remnants  of  the  hard  scattered particles.   They  decay  in  jets,  collimated  sprays  of  particles,  which  in  turn  can  say something about the initial partons.  In this thesis hard scattering events were generated with Pythia8 and Vincia.  Different samples with a gluon as the mother particle were  compared  by  filtering  light  quark  splits,  charm/beauty  quark  splits  and  gluon splits respectively. On  parton  level  one  can  observe  that  a  mother  parton  with  higher pt is  negatively correlated with the angle between its corresponding daughters.  For higher  ˆpt one can distinguish easier g→q ̄q from g→gg splits using Vincia. For a more evenly distributed pt between daughters a, b in a g→ab split is the angle between the daughters smaller than for less evenly distributed pt.  Furthermore the angle between the daughters drops ∼1/z for small z for events in both generators and for the whole z-spectrum only in Pythia8.  Also the events generated with Vincia do not obey the LO kernel splittingfunctions for z→0.5.With a jet matching algorithm matched/unmatched jets are distinguished and correlated with the corresponded daughters and mothers using profile plots. On average we see that the matched jet width and the matched jet mass of g→ggsplits is greater than for gluon to quark splits.  This means that we can differentiate the two samples from each other by looking at those observables.  We observed that the angle between the matched jets and the angle between the corresponding matched daughters is positively  correlated.   Furthermore  in  Vincia  we  observe  a  ’threshold’  in  the  transverse momentum of matched daughters for which daughters are found in the same jet.  We see that for daughters with pt&lt;75 GeV are on average more found in jets with twice the momentum than daughters with higher pt.  At last for higher daughter pt one can conclude that there radiate more particles closely around the daughter than for a daughter with lower pt, since for the latter both the jet width and the jet mass are less."

Au/TiO2 catalysts achieve high selectivity, but catalyst deactivation and low hydrogen conversions are major limitations. In this research, we explore the possibility of achieving selective propene epoxidation 
with gold-based bifunctional catalysts. The gold-based catalysts consisted of gold nanoparticles and (transition)-metal complexes active in homogeneous propene oxidation. Afterward, the catalytic performance of gold-based bifunctional catalysts has been studied in the direct gas-phase oxidation of propene with H2/O2 mixtures. Analysis of the catalytic results proved that SiO2 supported gold-based 
bifunctional catalysts are highly active but lack selectivity towards propene oxide primarily due to limited intimacy between both supported metals. Secondly, we studied the stability of monometallic Au/TiO2 catalysts, which tend to deactivate quickly at 100°C due to the irreversible adsorption of propene oxide. Furthermore, we aimed to increase the catalytic performance by the formation of 
supported bimetallic nanoparticles on either TiO2 or Ti-SiO2. UV-Vis Spectroscopy, XRD and TEM were applied to study the structure of the bimetallic nanoparticles. However, these characterization techniques were insufficient to verify the structure of the supported bimetallic nanoparticles. We found that Au/Ti-SiO2 was the best performing catalysts for the oxidation of propene. Bimetallic supported 
nanoparticles negatively affected the catalytic performance compared to monometallic supportedcatalyst due to excessive particle growth, competitive adsorption and the formation of individual nanoparticles."

Since then patenting activities are continuously increasing in both the US as well as in Europe. However, universities do not only hold patents which have been successfully exploited, but also patents which remain unused, also called sleeping patents. The aim of this thesis was to discover reasons why some universities’ patents remain unused while others are being commercialized. Hereby, the two sub-questions, “to which degree do universities hold sleeping patents?” and “what factors explain that university patents remain unused?” were created to help approach this phenomenon in more detail. For this, the patents of three Dutch universities, namely (1) Utrecht University (UU) and University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU), (2) Leiden University (LU) and University Medical Center Leiden (LUMC), and (3) Groningen University (GU) and University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), were analyzed to gain insights of this phenomenon. To this end, a quantitative method approach was chosen, whereby an online survey was sent to 1000 inventors. These were analyzed with a regression analysis, which is designed to show the influence of the four potential characteristics that were deduced from the eight categories of the institutional readiness (IR) framework. The results showed that some patents owned by universities remain unused, while others are commercialized, could be explained by the fact that some inventions from a university are too radical in character since inventions are more likely to be used when building upon previous technologies. Also, the importance of the economic use of patents must be perceived high by the inventors in order to attain commercial use of the patents. Thus, universities’ actors must have the capability to assess these two factors in advance in order to facilitate innovations. In light of this, this study is particularly interesting for universities to increase the commercialization rate of their patent portfolio. The researcher aimed not only to provide interdisciplinary knowledge, but also that this topic will receive attention, so that further research can be done in the future."

The JCPOA marked a significant change in the tense relation between Iran and the US. With the JCPOA, the US allowed Iran to have a limited nuclear program, which it had previously strongly opposed by imposing an intensive sanctions regime. The US nuclear policies from 2003 to 2021 have mainly focused on limiting Iran’s nuclear capacities with coercive diplomatic means. The US’s influence is visible in its ability to mobilize support for an international sanctions regime on Iran. From 2009, US policies concentrated on negotiating with Iran, and the impact of the US can be seen in the resolution of the impasse in negotiations with Iran and the signing of the JCPOA in 2015. However, since 2017, and particularly after the withdrawal of the US from the JCPOA in 2018, a downward trend is visible in the US influence on the nuclear non-proliferation regime, as the other JCPOA signatories actively criticized the US decision and supported the deal’s provisions. The findings of this research argue that US nuclear policies only recognize the stabilizing potential of nuclear weapons in the hands of the US and its allies and the proliferation of nuclear weapons to nations such as Iran remains unthinkable. The US nuclear policies from 2003 to 2021 reflect this inherently contradictory and hypocritical line of thought."

Hieruit blijkt dat de twee Secretarissen-Generaal deze begrippen allebei belangrijk vonden, maar dat ze de prioriteit ergens anders legden vanwege hun blik op het conflict. Hammarskjöld benaderde de crisis vanuit een internationale blik en probeerde de waarden van de VN, waaronder neutraliteit, zoveel mogelijk uit te dragen. Thant was veel meer gefocust op het herenigen van een verdeeld land en had een veel nationalere blik. Hierdoor verschoof de neutraliteit van de VN naar de achtergrond en was hij actiever in zijn steun voor de centrale overheid. Deze posities werden ook beïnvloed door de politieke situatie in Congo, die in het verloop van het conflict iets stabiliseerde, waardoor Thant andere beslissingen kon nemen dan zijn voorganger."

This study aimed to investigate if a team reflection intervention contributes to the development of the teamwork competences of students working in multidisciplinary teams. A combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques were used to answer the research question. A quasi-experiment was conducted to explore the influence of team reflection on the development of TWCs. The development of the TWCs was measured using a pre- and post-test and data was statistically analysed. Furthermore, interviews were conducted with students in the experimental group. The interviews were analysed using template analysis and provided further insights into the effect of the reflection intervention. The findings suggest that team reflection meetings provide a small but beneficial contribution to the development of TWCs especially for students working in multidisciplinary teams. Reflection meetings raised students’ awareness about TWCs, contributed to the development of reflection competence, and contributed to the development of TWCs related to communication."

It argued for the importance of popular discourse to literary prizes, answering the question: how can the disconnect regarding diversity and inclusivity that arises between popular discourse and literary prizes be resolved? It has done so by analysing three prizewinning works whose victories received a lot of criticism from the popular discourse: Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other, Margaret Atwood’s The Testaments and J.K. Rowling’s “J.K. Rowling Writes about Her Reasons for Speaking out on Sex and Gender Issues”. First the importance of popular discourse to literary prizes is established. Second, it is demonstrated that the existing disconnect relates to the dialogue around diversity and inclusivity. Lastly, the thesis demonstrates the way popular discourse’s critique shows in the literary work itself. It has concluded that the interconnection between popular discourse and literary prizes creates a need to assess an author’s ideology alongside their text. This ideology can be analysed by looking at the author’s discourse."
Het filosofisch problematische tweesporenbeleid in de psychiatrie,"['Jansen, L.']","['Lievers, M.', 'Tieleman, T.']",2021-09-08T18:00:16Z,nl,[],Philosophy,"In navolging van de somatisch geneeskunde is er een toenemende tendens binnen de psychiatrie om evidence based te werken. Dit komt voort uit een geschiedenis waarin er twijfel bestond over de objectiviteit en het wetenschappelijke karakter van de psychiatrie. Hieruit kwam de behoefte voort om een categorisatie systeem te introduceren wat heeft geleid tot de Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). Er wordt gepoogd om binnen de psychiatrie evidence based en wetenschappelijk te werken met als uitgangspunt de neurologie. Tegelijkertijd is de DSM-5 volledig gebaseerd op symptoombeschrijvingen en dus gedrag. Zo komen het behaviorisme, met een focus op publiekelijk waarneembaar gedrag, en de bio-psychiatrie, met een basis in de neurologie, samen in de psychiatrie.
In de praktijk worden deze perspectieven gecombineerd in het zogenoemde ‘tweesporenbeleid’, iets dat ook in onderzoek een grotere rol gaat spelen. Deze combinatie is filosofisch gezien echter problematisch. Aan de ene kant leidt een psychiatrische behandeling vanuit enkel een behavioristisch perspectief of enkel vanuit de bio-psychiatrie tot vreemde redenaties. Aan de andere kant is dit tweesporenbeleid problematisch omdat de correlatie tussen gedrag en onderliggende hersenprocessen niet stabiel is. Dat er geen stabiele correlatie tussen deze perspectieven is wordt zichtbaar aan de hand van een voorbeeld van cultuurgebonden psychiatrische syndromen."

Deze film combineert drama met documentaire op een reflexieve manier. Reflexiviteit is een concept dat van antropoloog Jay Ruby afkomstig is. Hiermee wordt bedoeld dat in de film zelf het maakproces ervan wordt getoond, en dat de kijker dus mee kan kijken in hoe de film is gemaakt. Volgens Ruby is het belangrijk dat documentaires reflexief zijn. Ook Steven N. Lipkin ziet dramadocumentaires als films die artistieke percepties zijn van historische gebeurtenissen. De kijker kijkt eigenlijk mee met de reflectie van de maker op deze gebeurtenissen. Ook in DRAMA GIRL kan er mee worden gekeken naar hoe de scènes worden opgezet en hoe erop wordt gereflecteerd. Hoewel de film een dramadocumentaire is en het als vanzelfsprekend wordt gezien dat documentaire gebaseerd is op waarheid, kan van de drama-elementen in de film niet zomaar met zekerheid worden gezegd of deze fictief zijn of niet. De scènes zijn door de regisseur opgezet en zijn dus zijn perceptie van de gebeurtenissen die gereconstrueerd worden. betekent dat er op bepaalde manieren verwijzingen naar een basis van waarheid moeten zijn, waardoor de kijker toch meekrijgt dat het verhaal gebaseerd is op waarheid. Deze verwijzingen heten waarheidsclaims. Met name Teresa Bergman geeft in haar case study een duidelijke definitie hiervan: elementen in de film die wijzen op een waarheid. Een concrete definitie of voorbeelden van manieren waarop waarheidsclaims tot uiting komen lijken er nog niet zozeer te zijn. Mede daarom analyseer ik in dit onderzoek op welke manieren de reflexiviteit DRAMA GIRL waarheidsclaims in de film ondersteunen. Ik doe dit aan de hand van zes categorieën van reflexiviteit die door Charlotte Govaert zijn opgesteld en die ik heb uitgebreid met voorbeelden van onder andere Ruby en Nichols over hoe reflexiviteit te zien kan zijn in een film. Hiermee kan meer inzicht verkregen worden in de vormen van reflexiviteit in DRAMA Girl, welke waarheidsclaims in de film worden prijsgegeven en welke rol de reflexiviteit speelt in het naar voren brengen van deze waarheidsclaims."
The Stifled War on Afghan Women,"['Smit, E.G.M.']","['Rutgers, L.V.']",2021-09-08T18:00:18Z,en,"['Women’s Rights, Afghanistan, Afghan Culture, Feminism, International Declarations, Islam, United Nations']",History,"There are two main themes we think of when Afghanistan is mentioned: Islamic extremism and its toxic misogyny. But how much do we understand about Afghanistan’s approach toward Islam and women’s rights? We recognise that women’s rights need to improve around the world, yet conflict-ridden countries like Afghanistan will continue to lag far behind as they fail to successfully implement these rights. Little research has been done into where the approach towards improving Afghan women’s rights by international actors such as NGOs and member states has gone wrong. Additionally, there is not much research into what kind of approach should be taken to provide more promising and effective results. Therefore, in my thesis I will analyse “to what extent Afghan women’s rights have improved since the fall of the Taliban?” This research question will enable me to weigh the advantages and drawbacks on the current approach taken by international organisations and the Afghan government on implementing women’s rights. I will do so in three stages. Firstly, by explaining the history of the ‘Taliban war against women’ throughout the twentieth century. Secondly, by analysing the effectiveness of recent declarations on women’s rights in Afghanistan. Lastly, I will look into how local and international actors that currently undermine the progression of Afghan women’s rights could instead improve the implementation of said rights. By highlighting the local and international aspects that have both positively and negatively affected the rights of Afghan women, my main aim is to emphasize the importance of including more than just western-centric solutions toward improving women’s rights in a country that is so culturally and historically different from the West. I conclude that, for international organizations to witness more effective results, they have to take an approach that should be tailored to the cultural and religious ideals of the local population. The best way of doing so is to understand the history of Afghanistan and provide agency to influential female Afghans who know so much better how to tackle the core issues of their poor treatment."
The Bumpy Road to Empowerment: Assessing Microfinancing in Sri Lanka from a Women's Empowerment Perspective,"['Carlier, F.M.']","['Gould, Lauren']",2021-09-08T18:00:17Z,en,"['Microfinancing, Empowerment, Sri Lanka, Women’s Empowerment Framework,Vicious Spirals']",Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"Microfinancing is a development strategy employed across the globe. In short, microfinancing refers to the provision of small loans/microcredit to impoverished populations. Microfinancing is particularly aimed at (rural) women and is professed to be positively concerned with women’s empowerment. Microfinancing became a central tenet of the Sri Lankan post-war development strategy. Recently, women’s protests against the negative implications of microfinancing broke out in Sri Lanka. In light of these protests, this thesis investigates the evolvement of the empowering impact of microfinancing on rural Sri Lankan women. In this regard, the overall aim of this research is to 1) assess microfinancing’s potential to empower women, and to 2) assess the appropriateness of microfinancing as a development strategy in the Sri Lankan context. To this end, Sara Longwe’s Women’s Empowerment
Framework is applied, a framework designed to analyze women’s empowerment through developmental efforts across five distinct dimensions of empowerment: 1) welfare, 2) access, 3) conscientization, 4) participation, 5) control. By using this framework, this thesis synthesizes the current academic debate surrounding microfinancing and women’s empowerment in Sri Lanka and purports a distinctly multi-dimensional understanding of the concept empowerment. From the analysis of rural Sri Lankan women’s empowerment across Longwe’s dimensions, constraints are distilled hampering empowerment and overarching patterns are deduced. These constraints and patterns are relevant not only in reference to the Sri Lankan case specifically but could also inform future research and deepen our understanding of microfinancing as a strategy that has the potential to both empower and disempower women at the same time."

The Microsoft antitrust case of 1998-2001 is used as a case study to provide lessons for antitrust regulators today. Four primary sources from the Department of Justice are manually coded and analyzed, namely the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, Final Judgment, and the Competitive Impact Statement. These documents were accompanied by secondary sources to account for lacking relevant information. The important lessons from the case study are that (1) prices form an inconclusive criterion for analyzing consumer welfare in the modern age, (2) trials need to move quickly, else remedies will not have the desired effect in the rapidly changing technology sector and (3) remedies need to be concrete and oriented on prevention versus punishment. Based on these findings, accompanied by prominent literature on regulating digital platform companies, the thesis concludes that antitrust is currently not capable of regulating digital platform monopolies in the United States. The thesis argues that antitrust has not managed to keep up with the rapid innovations of technology and therefore requires a substantial update in order to conform to the demands of regulation in the 21st century."

In Chapter One, I will explore the Dutch self-identity as progressive and how it conflicts with facts about LGBTQIA+ oppression in the Netherlands. Chapter Two will analyse literature on using Young Adult novels in a classroom setting and how LGBTQIA+ Young Adult literature can help teenagers become more openminded. Chapter Three looks at Becky Albertalli’s Simon Vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda in order to establish the importance of discussing identity formation and the relation between sexuality and gender performance. Chapter Four will use Kacen Callender’s Felix Ever After to argue the importance of transgender representation in Young Adult literature and to discuss whether labels are necessary and to whom. Chapter 5 will discuss the representation of queer fanfiction in Rainbow Rowell’s Fangirl, arguing that fanfiction could be employed in order to help teenagers connect to queer messages in literature. These chapters support the conclusion that LGBTQIA+ YA literature could provide the Netherlands with the opportunity to ensure the Netherlands continues to make progress when it comes to LGBTQIA+ acceptance."

To assess the level of success of this contribution, a theoretical framework based on three theories and conceptions on the state and state formation by Max Weber, Charles Tilly and Michael Mann.

La costellazione transmediale di Bellas Mariposas; una memoria culturale sarda e globale tra libro e film,"['Petersen, B.']","['Jansen, M.']",2021-09-08T18:00:37Z,it,[],Italiaanse taal en cultuur,"Bellas Mariposas is een novelle van de Sardijnse schrijver en journalist Sergio Atzeni, postuum
gepubliceerd in 1996. In 2012 kwam de gelijknamige film uit, geregisseerd door Salvatore Mereu.
Bellas Mariposas neemt je mee in een dag in het leven van de 12-jarige Caterina in een armoedige
wijk in Cagliari, de hoofdstad van Sardinië. Ze woont in een krappe flat samen met haar grote
familie te midden van drugsmisbruik, geweld, werkloosheid en seksueel misbruik. Ondanks dit
alles blijft Cate optimistisch en gelooft ze erin dat ze later zangeres zal worden, om zo te
ontsnappen aan haar lastige omstandigheden. Bellas Mariposas heeft altijd veel aandacht genoten,
niet alleen op Sardinië maar ook in de rest van Italië en sinds de première van de film, in
verschillende delen van Europa waaronder Nederland. Ook op academisch gebied zijn zowel het
verhaal als de film al meermaals onderwerp geweest en zelfs in het buitenland is er grote
belangstelling voor. Hoe kunnen we het succes van Bellas Mariposas verklaren? In de afgelopen
decennia heeft de Sardijnse fictie veel titels voortgebracht en deze levendigheid heeft geleid tot
termen zoals 'Sardinian nouvelle vague' die zich ook hebben uitgebreid naar de film, vaak
geïnspireerd door teksten uit Sardijnse fictie. Als uitgangspunt wordt het onderzoek van Astrid
Erll (2012) genomen over ""multi-mediale constellaties"" van cultureel geheugen. Een cultureel
geheugen wordt altijd door interactie van meerdere media gecreëerd. De hoofdvraag waarop in dit
onderzoek antwoord wordt gegeven luidt daarom als volgt: hoe is Bellas Mariposas onderdeel uit
gaan maken van het Sardijnse en (inter-)nationale culturele geheugen? Het antwoord op deze vraag
wordt geformuleerd aan de hand van close-reading en een analyse van de taal en de geografie in
zowel het boek als de film. Hierbij wordt aandacht gegeven aan de verschillen tussen het boek en
de film en de transmediale implicaties van deze verschuiving. Deze analyses worden geplaatst in
het kader van de Sardijnse nouvelle vague en il nuovo cinema sardo: nieuwe neorealistische
stromingen binnen de Sardijnse literatuur en film waarin meertaligheid, een nieuw geografisch
oogpunt en stilistische keuzes worden gecombineerd met als doel een meer waarheidsgetrouwe
representatie van Sardinië te geven. De hypothese is dat Bellas Mariposas heeft gezorgd voor een
nieuw beeld van een stedelijk Sardinië, tot dan toe in minimale mate vertegenwoordigd in de
Sardijnse literatuur en film. Dit perspectief zou worden versterkt door de verfilming in 2012 en
tegelijkertijd toegankelijker gemaakt voor een breder en diverser publiek. De uitkomst van het
onderzoek is dat Bellas Mariposas een instrument is geworden voor het opnieuw toe-eigenen van
identiteit voor de Sardijnen. Door de linguistische en geografische keuzes van Atzeni en Mereu
kan een nieuwe, gelaagde Sardijnse identiteit onstaan die zich uitspreidt als een multimediale
constellatie en zo doordringt in het culturele geheugen van zowel de Sardijnen als het (inter-)
nationale publiek."
Nehemiah Wallington (1598-1658): A Conventional Martyr? Suffering and Sinfulness in Wallington's Seventeenth-century Notebooks,"['Wegener, P.R.']","['Stelling, L.J.']",2021-09-08T18:00:36Z,en,"['Nehemiah Wallington, martyrdom, Puritanism']","Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Studies","The notebooks written by the London woodturner Nehemiah Wallington (1598-1658) are a fascinating source for examining the enduring impact of the theme of martyrdom long after the persecutions of Protestants during the reign of Mary I (1553-1558). In a period in which even non-conformist Protestants were relatively safe, Wallington insists upon suffering, and quotes from John Foxe’s Book of Martyrs (first published in 1563) in a way that suggests that the physical of Protestants is still his daily reality. The afterlife of Foxe’s Book of Martyrs is still understudied, and Wallington’s notebooks offer a wealth of information on how people engaged with Foxe’s legacy. In this thesis, I discuss how Wallington gives meaning to his suffering by constructing an imagined community of Protestants, which Wallington bases on Foxe’s community of martyrs. Rather than death through martyrdom, Wallington sees suffering more generally as crucial to this community, and includes all Protestants. In addition to his imagined community, Wallington also creates his own narrative of suffering based on two major characteristics of suffering transmitted by Foxe: joyful suffering, and suffering as a trial of faith or an instructive message from God. Wallington struggles to apply these frameworks to his own suffering, because his suffering is spiritual, rather than physical, and characterized by an overwhelming awareness of his sinfulness. My analysis of Wallington’s notebooks demonstrates that Foxe’s templates do not always suffice in the case of feelings of spiritual inadequacy and the overwhelming sense of sinfulness that haunt Wallington. Wallington’s writings demonstrate the shortcomings of his Foxean approach in the changed circumstances of his own time. As a consequence, Wallington experiences deep spiritual crises. My research findings demonstrate that Wallington still manages to relate his highly individual struggle with his sinfulness to his imagined community. Wallington does so by seeing not only suffering, but also sinfulness as a crucial characteristic of both him and his imagined community, and by approaching suffering as a purging mechanism that demonstrates his membership of God’s special community."
Optimization of Operation and Design of a Multi-Energy System for the Production of Low-Carbon Methanol,"['Bosma, D.']","['Gazzani, M.']",2021-09-08T18:00:44Z,en,"['Methanol, Multi-Energy System, MES, Optimization, MILP, CCS, Design']",Energy Science,"Methanol is one of the key feedstocks in the chemical industry and seen as a potential synthetic fuel replacement for maritime and air transport. Currently, most methanol is produced via the steam reforming of natural gas, resulting in significant greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable methanol, on the other hand, can be produced via multiple path- ways, each resulting in different energy and capital requirements, as well as CO2 emissions.
This research integrates these different pathways in the context of a multi-energy system and linearly optimizes the design and operation of that system to analyse which path- way is preferred for the industrial cluster of Rotterdam in terms of associated costs and emissions per produced tonne of methanol. In this research, an assessment is made on the effect of (i) including and excluding a CO2 storage facility, (ii) the type and origin of biomass and (iii) the steam biomass ratio in the biomass gasification routes on the optimal design of the multi-energy system.
It is found that the inclusion of a CO2 storage facility significantly improves the optimal design of the multi-energy system in terms of both costs and emissions, making it even possible to obtain negative emissions with only minor cost increases. In this design, the preferred methanol production method is a biomass gasification method that includes CO2 capture. Regarding the type of biomass it is found that biomass from close by is preferred due to lower costs and emissions associated with transport. Finally, a low steam biomass ratio is preferred; the lower biomass consumption at higher steam biomass ratios does weigh up against its higher steam consumption in terms of both costs and emissions"

Hoewel de beoordelingen van de analfabete NT2-leerders gemiddeld niet significant bleken te verschillen van de beoordelingen van gealfabetiseerde NT2-leerders, waren de gealfabetiseerde leerders beter in staat om de minder bekende (zuidelijke) variant correct te categoriseren dan ongeletterde leerders.

As a group of women who faced legal, religious and physical persecution, the figure of the witch has been transformed over time to be frequently depicted as a green-faced, immoral figure of evil, losing accuracy in modern depictions and detaching from historical accuracy. In particular, this thesis will use Circe by Madeline Miller, The Year of the Witching by Alexis Henderson and Pine by Francis Toon as well as television examples such as The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and American Horror Story: Coven. In Chapter 1 I will focus on the reconnection to the role of the witch as an early nurse, specifically focusing on Miller’s Circe. In Chapter 2 I will analyse the role of the witch as a mother and the connection to the patriarchy, concentrating on Toon’s Pine. Lastly, Chapter 3 discusses the witches’ link to religion and the occult, focusing on the aforementioned television shows and Henderson’s The Year of the Witching. Significantly, the findings of this thesis have demonstrated that there is undoubtedly a movement to depict the witch more accurately, demonstrating how popular culture examples can more precisely create forms of entertainment that enrich historical understanding rather than detract from it."

When
sea-level rise slowed down during the late Holocene, some of these estuaries filled with
sediment, where others remained largely unfilled. Vegetation has an important ecoengineering
effect and contributes to estuary infilling. It is unclear, however, how net
importing estuaries will respond to the current and projected sea-level rise. To this end,
we conducted scaled laboratory experiments in the 20 x 3 m tilting 
flume the Metronome,
which can simulate tidal currents. By asymmetric tilting, a 
flood dominated, net importing
estuary was created, and sediment was supplied to the seaward and landward
boundaries. A mud simulant was used and seeds of plant species with eco-engineering behaviour
were supplied into the 
flow periodically. The channel network evolution through
time was mapped using a recently developed network extraction tool. This tool can extract

Fluvial networks from elevation data in an objective way.
It was found that sea-level rise enhances sediment mobility which, in combination with

Flood dominance leads to higher sediment 
fluxes to the upstream part of the experiment
than in experiments without sea-level rise. Sea-level rise also allows tidal currents to propagate
further upstream which promotes channel formation upstream in the experiment.
Most importantly, sea-level rise causes the morphological units in estuaries to shift landward
and the upstream part of the system to silt up, given enough sediment is available to
fill the created accommodation. In the case of low sediment availability, which is common
in systems in which dams and dikes are built, coastal squeeze may prevent transgression
and estuarine environments will drown. Two examples, the Scheldt and the Wadden sea,
are considered to illustrate what the fate of estuaries could be, considering the current
and predicted sea-level rise. It is found that if sea-level rise stays on the low end of the
predictions (40 cm/100 yrs), the Scheldt and the Wadden sea area may aggrade to maintain
a stable position. In case sea-level rises faster, these systems are likely to transgress
but are prone to coastal squeeze because of man-made hard boundaries directly landward
of them. It is therefore expected that many of these systems will drown in the centuries
to come, unless we change our coastal management strategy and create more space for
systems to silt up and keep up with sea-level. The findings of this study can contribute
to managing estuaries sustainably in terms of sediment budgets, navigability and ecology."
The shrinkage of Lake Manyara: causes and management options for lake protection,"['Compen, V.L.P.']","['Sterk, G.', 'Zeylmans van Emmichoven, M.']",2021-09-08T18:01:04Z,en,"['Lake Manyara, East African Rift System, Tanzania, Sedimentation, Gully erosion, Droughts']",Earth Surface and Water,"Lake Manyara is a terminal soda lake in the East African Rift System in Northern Tanzania, which provides an important habitat for flora and fauna in the area. Its size also reflects the water availability in the catchment, which is of great importance for local human inhabitants and wildlife. Lake levels naturally fluctuate over the year, but they have been following a shrinking trend in the past decades. The factors that contribute to the shrinkage of the lake have been researched in several studies, but the cause of the shrinkage remained unknown. The aim of this research was to unravel the causes of the shrinkage of Lake Manyara and to discuss management options that best guarantee a sustainable future for the lake. A literature review was carried out to determine which factors contribute to the shrinkage of Lake Manyara. Results strongly suggest that both the use of irrigation water and changes in land use and land cover have neglectable impacts on the shrinkage of the lake. The combination of precipitation and evapotranspiration seems to have a large impact on the size of Lake Manyara. Future rainfall is uncertain because of the East African Climate Paradox, but temperatures in the area will almost certainly increase in the coming decades. Increasing temperatures will lead to increased amounts of evapotranspiration and enhanced periods of droughts. This will almost certainly cause a decreasing size of Lake Manyara in the coming decades, mainly in the dry season. To determine the contribution of gully erosion to the shrinking lake levels, a remote sensing study based on images from Google Earth Pro was performed. Sedimentation in Lake Manyara does occur as a result of gully erosion, but the contribution of sediment load to the shrinkage of the lake is minor when compared to climatological changes. Management strategies that could enhance environmental rehabilitation help to adapt to drought conditions were discussed. It was shown that socioeconomical factors should be taken into account when selecting measures, since the success of proposed measures largely depends on them. The implementation of local measures will have a positive impact on the environment and the livelihoods of humans in the catchment. Local measures will however not prevent the shrinkage of Lake Manyara, since anthropogenic climate change is by far the largest contributor to its shrinkage."
Exploring the role of investors in the alternative ‘meat’ transition,"['Erbe, F.C.']","['Kalfagianni, A.']",2021-09-08T18:01:04Z,en,"['alternative meat, sustainable investment, multi-level perspective, power in transition, transition intermediary']",Sustainable Development,"One of society’s greatest challenges for future sustainable development is how to feed nearly 10 billion people by 2050 while simultaneously achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and staying within the planetary boundaries. This requires an urgent transformation of current global food systems. Livestock production makes up a significant amount of current environmental, health and animal welfare impacts, and its transformation offers important sustainability gains. Alternative ‘meat’ products offer an innovation path with the potential to disrupt the current meat industry and transition it to a sustainable state. Investments are important to finance such a transition, and thus investors can play an important role in enabling or disabling the transition through their position as a dominant regime actor interacting with niche innovations in the transition. This thesis combines the multi-level perspective on sustainability transitions, power and transition intermediary theory to explore the power and role of investors in the alternative ‘meat’ transition, focusing on the case of the German alternative ‘meat’ investment space.
Through investor interviews and document analysis, the results reveal that early-stage investors invest in alternative ‘meat’ to achieve environmental and social goals, while later- stage investors aim for economic and financial goals. Further, all investors not only mobilise financial capital, but also mental and human resources, with some mobilising artifactual resources. Regarding power exercise of investors, the thesis finds that different types of investors exercise different types of power along the alternative ‘meat’ niche’s financing cycle. Investors in earlier stages of the transition exercise innovative and transformative power, while investors in later stages exercise transformative and reinforcive power. Most of this power exercise by investors is is passively done through enabling start-ups to create new resources and infrastructure. It is also found that investors exhibit some intermediary functions, most importantly networking and knowledge and learning in connecting niche and regime actors in the alternative ‘meat’ space.
To support the alternative ‘meat’ transition, investors can utilise their resources as investors as strengths as well as create investors networks and alliances to strengthen their power position in the alternative ‘meat’ market and policymaking space. Legislation that crafts a comprehensive policy framework for supporting alternative ‘meat’ as well as establishes guidelines for environmental and social investment guidelines will support an inflow of investment in sustainable investments such as alternative ‘meat’."

(green: no beetle outbreak at the site; yellow and red: not long ago beetle outbreak resulting in yellow and red needles in pines; and grey: long ago post-outbreak, deriving in pines with no more needles and fallen branches). Geochemical components varied across these structures and altitudes in different ways. Main results tell that organic matter, potassium ion,  sodium ion, and humidity content had greater concentrations across the yellow and red forest structures, while nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium ion, and magnesium ion had the greatest concentrations across grey structures.
The study exhibited that weather parameters appear to be drivers for this natural dynamic at the VCC, where a decrease in precipitation and relative humidity, along with increases in air temperature and radiation correlated to the late outbreaks and high forest vegetation transitions. The cumulative generated data indicates that the dynamic occurs mostly in the altitudinal range comprehended between 3400 and 3800 masl."

they affect marginalized groups negatively when their decisions are driven 
by algorithmic social bias. An important way to look at this problem, is to 
investigate what notion of fairness marginalized groups need to be treated 
justly, and how to use this notion to find proper mitigation measures. This 
thesis aims to find how algorithmic bias in automated decision-making 
algorithms can be mitigated to prevent discriminatory decisions. In this 
context, algorithmic bias roughly refers to the concern that an algorithm is
not merely a neutral transformer of data or extractor of information. There 
are many sources of algorithmic bias, and they emerge in different stages 
of machine learning."

Children with incontinence problems can develop many additional complaints, such as internalizing behavior problems (anxiety and depression). This study investigated a relationship between the degree of incontinence and internalizing behavioral problems in children. In addition, it was also investigated whether the relationship is different for boys and girls. Methods: 46 children between the ages of 6 and 13 with functional urinary incontinence participated in this study. All children have been diagnosed in the in the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital on the Urotherapy department. Parents filled in the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) subscale: ‘Anxiety/Depressed’ and ‘Withdrawn/Depressed’ during registration. In addition, parents completed a micturition anamnesis to chart the degree of incontinence. Results: The results showed that no correlation was found between the degree of incontinence and internalizing behavioral problems in primary school children. This study also suggested that no evidence has been found that gender difference moderates this relationship. Conclusion: In conclusion, it can be said that no link has been found between the degree of incontinence and the severity of internalizing behaviour problems with the children in primary school and that no moderation effect of sex has been found on this link. Finally, longitudinal research is needed to gain more insight into the relationship between the degree of incontinence and internalizing and behavioral problems."
"The relation between parental attributions and harsh discipline during toddlerhood: Are there differences between fathers, mothers, sons and doughters?","['Leeuw, N. de']","['Verhoeven, M.', 'Portengen, C.']",2021-09-08T18:01:29Z,nl,['child-responsible attributions; harsh discipline; sex differences mothers and fathers; sex differences sons and daughters; toddlerhood.'],"Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Harsh discipline is punishing in a harsh way to discipline a child, which in time can lead to emotional and behavioural problems. In the present research the relationship between child-responsible attributions and harsh discipline has been studied, specifically focussing on differences between mothers, fathers, sons and daughters. The data has been gathered though the means of self-report. Parents of 127 toddlers (M=34.09 months, SD=8.56, 46.9 % boys) were asked to fill in questionnaires. Paired t-tests showed that mothers appear to make more child-responsible attributions than fathers. For the use of harsh discipline no differences between mothers and fathers were found. Neither were any differences found in the level of child-responsible attributions or use of harsh discipline in regard to sons or daughters. Next to that, a Pearson analysis showed that for mothers higher scores on child-responsible attributions are related to higher scores on harsh discipline. This relation was not found for fathers. In conclusion, only the sex of the parent seems to influence the making of child-responsible attributions and whether this leads to harsh discipline. The sex of the child does not seem to affect either the making of child-responsible attributions nor the use of harsh discipline. As harsh discipline can lead to emotional and behavioural problems in children, for future research it would be valuable to further explore these sex differences between mothers and fathers."
Moral injury in frontline workers of the COVID-19 pandemic and predicting factors,"['Groot, J.F. de']","['Rie, R., de la']",2021-09-08T18:01:27Z,en,['Moral injury; frontline workers; COVID-19; PTSD; potential morally injurious events; negative feelings afterwards; event vividness; the centrality of event'],Clinical Psychology,"The spreading of the COVID-19 virus in 2020 led to overloaded hospitals and frontline workers in hospitals were confronted with a lack of resources and inadequate treatments. As a result, patients could not be provided with the best care and frontline workers were faced with moral dilemmas. Moral injury could be developed and this characterised by: (1) betrayal of what is right, (2) either inflicted by oneself or a person of authority and (3) in a high stakes situation. There is an overlap between symptoms of moral injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), however PTSD does not completely account for the morally injurious part of trauma. This research aims to gain more insight in moral injury and frontline workers and potential predicting factors. A questionnaire was designed to measure symptoms of moral injury, potential morally injurious events (PMIE’s), PTSD symptoms, negative feelings afterwards, event vividness and the centrality of event. The results show that frontline workers experience more PMIE’s related to working at the COVID-19 department and PTSD symptoms than the control group. There was no significant difference found between the groups for moral injury symptoms. This could be due to a supportive work environment or the operalization of moral injury. In addition, the results show that symptoms of moral injury were predicted by negative feelings afterwards, event vividness and the centrality of event. Lastly, an in-depth interview was held to examine the psychological burden of frontline workers. These results suggest that frontline workers experience moral dilemmas and psychological complaints. More research on moral injury and frontline workers is needed, so psychological problems during a crisis can be prevented and treated."
"Gender Differences in the Effects of Socially Withdrawn Behavior on Depression, Anxiety,

on children’s well-being. This study looked into the effects of socially withdrawn behavior on 
several internalizing problems, such as depression, anxiety, and self-esteem, and the gender 
differences within these effects. It was hypothesized that socially withdrawn children will 
experience more symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a lower self-esteem compared to their
non-withdrawn peers. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that socially withdrawn boys will 
experience more symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a lower self-esteem compared to 
socially withdrawn girls. This study used 215 students from grade four to six in its analyses. The 
mean age of this group was 11 years and 3 months. These children were grouped as socially 
withdrawn or non-withdrawn. The Revised Class Play was used to measure social withdrawal, 
the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale - 25 for depression and anxiety, and the 
Competentiebevelingsschaal voor Kinderen for self-esteem. A MANOVA and multiple
ANOVAs were used as the statistical measures. Results showed that socially withdrawn children 
suffered significantly more from depression and social anxiety, and had a lower self-esteem than 
non-withdrawn children. However, no significant gender differences were found within these 
effects. Age was also incorporated as a control variable, but was not found to be significant.
Some strengths within this study were the use of reliable instruments and statistical measures and 
the classifications of social withdrawal. This study also had some limitations, such as the use of a 
culturally unbalanced sample and the analysis of data that were collected 15 years ago, which 
should be taken into account by future researchers. Findings from this study may be informative 
to teachers or professionals who work with socially withdrawn children."
Inflamed Depression: The link between Depression and Inflammation expressed by CRP and IL-6 markers in the elderly population,"['Urbaitė, D.']","['Gerritsen, L.']",2021-09-08T18:01:26Z,en,[],Clinical Psychology,"Even though various interventions for the treatment of depression have been developed, around 30% of depressed individuals do not respond to the treatment which indicates that there is a gap in understanding the underlying mechanisms of this disorder (Leighton et al., 2018).
One potential biological mechanism may be inflammation, as depressed individuals often have heightened inflammatory responses such as heightened levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The current paper, therefore, aims at investigating to what extent heightened inflammatory responses can be explained by depression. The hypotheses that depression will be associated with higher levels of CRP, as well as higher levels of IL-6, were determined through the review of existing literature. 
Two longitudinal data sets from The Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging and OCTO-Twin study were used (N=474, Mage=79, 63% female). Two sets of linear regression models were run for each inflammatory marker: CRP and IL-6. The analyses yielded no significant results regarding the prediction of CRP and IL-6 from depression. However, the exploratory analyses revealed significant effects of age, smoking, and BMI on the inflammatory markers, suggesting that inflammation can be better explained by these factors than depressive symptoms as observed in the elderly population.
Causal conclusions are extremely challenging to draw due to unknown confounding variables as well as the possibility of reversed directionality with inflammation posing greater risks for the development of depression rather than the other way around. Keeping in mind the rise of disabilities following depression, as well as the crisis of Sars-CoV-2 which imposes great risks for the older population as well as potential risks for depressed individuals, future research should continue exploring the topic of the bi-directional link of depression and inflammation in order to develop novel approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the issues."

In a world where existing legal frameworks seem able to provide little guidance when it comes to ethical dilemmas surrounding restitution issues, the need for alternative frameworks becomes all the more pressing. Furthermore, the repatriation debate within philosophy is held hostage by a stalemate between two opposite positions concerning cultural property, cultural internationalism and cultural nationalism. In this thesis I will explore when the repatriation of stolen and looted art and artefacts is morally justified. First, the practice of repatriation is illuminated and I reveal the universal museum as an institution in line with cultural internationalism. Both cultural internationalism and cultural nationalism will be applied to a cases involving ancient looted art, Nazi looted art and the litmus test of repatriation claims: colonial looted art. In the last chapter I propose an alternative framework that deploys arguments from the cultural internationalist framework in favour of repatriation and combine them with Bernard Boxill’s harm argument from the debate about reparations for slavery."

Then, mediation analysis showed partial mediating effects of Integrated and Introjected motivation on the studied relationship. The mediating effect of Integrated motivation was bigger than that of Introjected motivation, highlighting that when anxiety is internally integrated by the person experiencing it, it is becomes a healthy behavioral force.

This thesis positions itself in the field of the study of privacy in history, and offers new perspectives to this field as privacy in early (7th and 8th century) Ireland has not been studied thoroughly before. The thesis shows that privacy as a concept was present in both early Irish laws and narratives from the Irish epic Táin Bó Cúailnge in many different ways. The instances of privacy that occur in the laws and in the narratives of the Táin Bó Cúailnge are noted and analysed according to different definitions of privacy, mostly having to do with privacy of information, privacy of action, and with access and control (over privacy). After this, a comparison is drawn up between the instances as found in the laws and in the narratives in order to view similarities. In doing so, this thesis sets out to show the importance of privacy in both these sources, and to show that, while privacy is often researched in a modern context, it has been around for many centuries, and that researching privacy in a historical context can provide valuable and unique insights into the concept of privacy as a whole while also giving a fuller and more complete picture of its history. This thesis is aimed mostly at those with an existing interest in medieval Ireland and in privacy studies, although efforts have been made to make it understandable and interesting for all."

Evidence-based insights from the literature were synthesized with practice-based insights derived from interviews with students (N=6), teachers (N=4) and experts (N=5) involved in global citizenship education. Six potential workable elements were synthesized in the impact theory: global knowledge, global consciousness, multiple perspectives, critical thinking, self-efficacy and active learning. Five preconditions were synthesized in the process theory: a structural approach in school, school democracy, an open pedagogical climate, connection to experiences of students and willingness to take action. A document analysis showed that global knowledge, global consciousness, and active learning were described in the Globaland XL program. Other elements were not or fragmentarily recognized in the program, a justification for the program activities was missing. It is recommended to expand the program theory with a theoretical foundation for the program activities."

outcomes through avoidance job crafting. Work outcomes that were examined include work 
engagement, performance and burnout. Data were collected among 204 participants from an 
HR consultancy firm that works mainly in the life sciences field. Data were analyzed with the 
PROCESS macro by Hayes (2013). Findings showed that authenticity is positively associated 
with work engagement and job performance and negatively with burnout. Furthermore, it 
demonstrated a negative link to decreasing hindering demands and increasing social 
resources. No other job crafting types showed significant associations with authentic 
behavior. Mediation analyses demonstrated that decreasing hindering demands acted as a 
mediator in the relationship between authenticity and work engagement. However, because 
the direct effect of authenticity was significant, avoidance job crafting was considered to be 
only a partial mediator. Due to the fact that two of the approach job crafting scales did not 
relate to authenticity and one did not relate to the outcome variable, they were excluded from 
mediation analyses, and thus, it can be concluded that they do not have an indirect effect in 
the link between authenticity and the studied work outcomes. At the end of the paper the 
interpretation of the above-mentioned results is outlined, together with the limitations of the

Predicting Online Participation in Public Broadcasting Using Machine Learning,"['Regter, W.']","['Schaefer, M.', 'Kemman, M.']",2021-09-08T18:01:51Z,en_US,[],Applied Data Science,"As it remains unclear how the success of public broadcasting on social media should
be measured, this thesis argues that online participation could serve as an alternative, social
media metric that aligns with public broadcasting’s traditional aims and draws support from
more general public research and audience research. Consequently, public broadcasting
benefits from understanding what online participation can be expected of their new media
content. For this reason, and to help characterize online participation as an alternative metric
of online participation, this thesis aims to investigate to what extent a predictive model of
online participation can be built, and which predictors are important in the process. In addition,
this thesis aims to investigate whether topic modeling can be applied on the subtitles of public
broadcasting shows to generate useful features for the prediction of online participation. Using
data from the Dutch public broadcasting service, 22 potentially predictive features of online
participation were collected and created, missing values and outliers were dealt with, and 7
models were individually tuned and compared with the aim of achieving the best prediction
performance. The results suggest that although most values of online participation can be
predicted with decent accuracy, the model performs poorly on large values of online
participation. Furthermore, the results indicate that the inclusion of topics as features did not
lead to significant improvements in prediction performance but do generate some useful
insights. Scholars and public broadcasting organizations may use the results of this thesis to
enhance their understanding of online participation as an alternative metric of broadcasting
success."
Role of Collective Guilt in Majority Group Members’ Response to Social Change,"['Şahin, P.']","['Bacchini, E.']",2021-09-08T18:01:43Z,en,[],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Faced with social change, majority group members feel threatened and resist change with the
desire for a stable society. This paper explores the effect of a collective feeling as opposed to
individual feelings, collective guilt, and further investigates implications for supporting social
change in white men. The results suggest that when white men are asked to think about their
privileges, they feel increased negative emotions. Contrary to previous findings, white men
feel negative emotions about a stable society. Heart rate measures, being an indication of
attentional and emotional engagement, showed considering one’s privileges and subsequently
reading about how society is changing in terms of the position of minority groups lead to
higher engagement in white men. Mediation analysis has shown that collective guilt is not
predicted by privilege listing as previously suggested and it does not mediate the relationship
between privilege listing and negative emotions. Rather, it predicts negative emotions and,
according to literature, these emotions can indicate the motivation for action."

Een kritiek onderdeel van deze crisis betrof de discussie over het wel of niet dragen van een mondkapje in de publieke ruimte. Elk land en elke regering ging anders om met de naderende dreiging van het Coronavirus, waaronder dus ook Spanje en Nederland. 

Dit onderzoek heeft als doel om belangrijke overeenkomsten en verschillen te achterhalen tussen de aanloop naar de mondkapjesplicht in Spanje en die in Nederland. Om dit ten uitvoer te brengen vertrekt dit onderzoek vanuit de volgende hoofdvraag: “Hoe verhouden de mondkapjesplicht in Spanje en Nederland zich intercultureel tot elkaar?” Onder de mondkapjesplicht zal worden verstaan de plicht onder mensen vanaf 6 of 13 jaar oud om in publieke (binnen (en buiten)ruimtes een mondkapje te dragen. De aanloop naar de mondkapjesplicht dient op haar beurt als ‘tertium comparationis’ voor de interculturele vergelijking, in eenvoudige taal het kruispunt of nulpunt van de vergelijking. 

Om een antwoord te formuleren op de onderzoeksvraag is er een corpus opgesteld bestaande uit nationaal en/of regionaal verspreide dagbladen in Nederland en Spanje. Een belangrijke voorwaarde was dat de artikelen te vinden waren in de databank NexisUni. Uiteindelijk zijn per land drie dagbladen geselecteerd en uit deze in totaal zes dagbladen zijn 10 artikelen per dagblad geselecteerd in de maand waarin de mondkapjesplicht officieel werd. Voor Spanje is dat de periode 15 april tot en met 19 mei 2020, voor Nederland zijn er artikelen van 11 oktober tot en met 19 november 2020 gezocht. Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat de beginfase de meeste overeenkomsten kende en dat verschillen niet alleen ontstaan door verschillende scores per dimensie, maar ook binnen dimensies. Onder meer het begrip van vrijheid, publieke ruimten en onvrede worden anders verwoord of hebben een andere betekenis in de ene of de andere cultuur.
Waterdicht bewijs biedt dit onderzoek niet, maar wel kan het aantonen dat enkele dimensies van Hofstede minder vast staan dan dat het op papier lijkt. De grootste verschillen lijken te ontstaan bij dimensies met een hogere waarde, zoals onzekerheidsvermijding, masculiniteit en individualisme. Voor vervolgonderzoek wordt geadviseerd om betrokkenen van een belangrijke sociale regel te interviewen over de rol van de nationale cultuur in het beleid of om een kwantitatieve analyse te doen naar het effect van bijvoorbeeld de media bij het invoeren of loslaten van vrijheidsbeperkende maatregelen in crisistijd."

is dat er al lange tijd een dispuut bestaat in het huidige onderzoeksveld over of de Biënnale
daadwerkelijk wel zou vrij en vooruitstrevend zou zijn geweest als dat er wordt beweerd. Het is
relevant, nu er twintig jaar overheen is gegaan, duidelijkheid te verschaffen over dit dispuut om
een beter beeld te krijgen van de hedendaagse Chinese kunst. De Shanghai Biënnale toont
namelijk een trend in de hedendaagse Chinese kunst die een afspiegeling vormt van wat er in
de bredere zin gebeurde in de Chinese kunstwereld in het jaar 2000.
Om de mate van vrijheid op de tentoonstelling te beoordelen is de invloed van de
Chinese overheid tijdens de Shanghai Biënnale middels censuur onderzocht. Om een uitspraak
te kunnen doen over de vooruitstrevendheid van de Shanghai Biënnale is er een analyse
gemaakt van de meest in het oog springende vernieuwingen wat betreft de keuzes in
kunstenaars die zijn uitgenodigd en de tentoongestelde werken. Daarnaast is er een vergelijking
gemaakt met de gelijktijdig gehouden satelliet tentoonstellingen ‘Fuck Off’ en ‘Useful life’. Deze
analyses zijn gedaan middels een literatuuronderzoek waarbij gebruik is gemaakt van
secundaire bronnen. De derde Shanghai Biënnale is hierbij vanuit een postkoloniaal theoretisch

een belangrijk uitgangspunt.
De analyse in deze paper laat zien dat er sprake was van vooruitstrevendheid op de
Shanghai Biënnale omdat vernieuwingen zoals de aanwezigheid van experimentele kunst en de
mate van internationalisering klaarblijkelijk waren. Toch spreekt de continuïteit met de
voorgaande Biënnales het vooruitstrevende beeld van de Biënnale enigszins tegen. De tweede
conclusie die uit dit onderzoek kan worden getrokken is dat de mate van vrijheid op de
Biënnale minimaal was. De curatoren kregen heel beperkt ruimte van de Chinese overheid om
zelf keuzes te maken over het inrichten van de tentoonstelling, maar vervolgens werd alles
alsnog gecensureerd."
Navigating Food Insecurity,"['Blake, S.L.']","['Cremers, G.']",2021-09-09T18:00:22Z,en,['food insecurity; structural violence; neoliberalism; gift exchange; food bank; volunteers; asylum seekers'],Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"""This thesis explores the structural violence of food insecurity within a neoliberal context, using the case study of a food bank in Glasgow, Scotland. The work shows how individuals who use the food bank, both service users and volunteers, navigate the neoliberal ideal of individualism and 'responsibilism' when needing support. The anthropological lens has allowed a human level of storytelling to question the narrative of food insecurity being a problem for which individuals are responsible. Through three months of volunteering in a food bank in Glasgow, this thesis builds its argument on participant observation and semi-structured interviews with the service users and volunteers of the charity. 
The thesis shows how children and asylum seekers are understood to need and ‘deserve’ support within Scottish society and the foodbank. It explores how the neoliberal narrative of individualism creates a barrier for those who need support but do not see themselves as ‘needy’ and ‘deserving’. The volunteers within the food bank navigate this dynamic of structural violence and neoliberalism by engaging in gift exchange, wherein they volunteer at the food bank and understand this work to be in exchange for access to cheaper and free food. This exchange allows them the support and access from a food bank, whilst navigating the assumption of failure associated with using a charity in a neoliberal context.

Dit werk geeft echter een verdiepend perspectief en omvat een ervaringsgeschiedenis, waarmee het het domein van de microgeschiedenis aanraakt. Binnen dit onderzoek staan de ervaringen van Nederlandse burgers die niet gemobiliseerd werden of meevochten, maar achterbleven centraal. De vraag in hoeverre op het individuele niveau van ‘gewone’ Nederlandse burgers de afzijdigheid en neutraliteit van ‘de landelijk politiek’ op macroniveau resoneerde, staat hierbij centraal.
Om een antwoord te formuleren op deze vraag zijn vier dagboeken van Nederlandse burgers onderzocht en is gekeken in hoeverre deze vier schrijvers het standpunt van neutraliteit delen en uit hun dagboeken een ervaring van afzijdigheid blijkt. De ervaringen zijn bestudeerd vanuit drie domeinen: een politiek domein, waar de ervaringen van de schrijvers tegenover de neutrale, afwezige houding van de Nederlandse politiek gelegd worden; een militair domein, van waaruit ervaringen met geïnterneerde soldaten en de mobilisatie onderzocht worden; en een sociaal domein, waarin de vluchtelingencrisis centraal staat.
Op de drie domeinen laten de dagboekschrijvers zich uit over hun ervaringen met verschillende aspecten van de oorlog, deze zijn niet neutraal en niet afzijdig te noemen. Op een enkele ervaring na zijn de dagboekschrijvers niet afzijdig maar betrokken bij de verschillende aspecten en komen niet neutrale gevoelens naar boven die zich op verschillende manieren manifesteren.
De manier waarop de ervaringen en gevoelens tegenover de verschillende kwesties besproken in de drie domeinen zich manifesteren, worden in dit onderzoek besproken.

This view is based on two erroneous assumptions. The first stems from the once-popular ‘end of history’ view and is based on the idea that the end of the Cold War was synonymous with the collapse of global communism and thus with the decreasing decisiveness of insurgents that identify with this ideology. The second assumption is that the CPP’s dedication to Maoism is as strong as the movement has claimed since it was founded in 1968. This study aims to challenge this limited and outdated view by examining the extent to which the Communist Party of the Philippines’ dedication to Maoism and its accompanying military strategy has altered since 1991. It does so by making a distinction between the movement’s public and private activities. Public activities are examined through the party’s frequent and widely accessible publications. Private activities are represented by the ideas of founder and ideological leader Jose Maria Sison, who was interviewed for this research in March and December 2020. What became clear is that although the movement continued to affirm its strict ideological and strategical dedication after 1991 publicly, the private ideas during this period show an increasing tendency towards a more pragmatic, revisionist approach."

Daarnaast vulden de deelnemers voor en na het kijken van de commercials een vragenlijst in over persoonlijkheidskenmerken, waarvan de vragenlijst over NFA van belang was voor dit onderzoek. De resultaten suggereren dat ontroerende narratieve commercials overtuigender dan of minstens zo overtuigend zijn als de grappige narratieve commercials. De mate van NFA was niet bepalend voor de overtuigingskracht van ontroerende en grappige narratieve commercials. Daarnaast suggereren de resultaten dat de mate van NFA geen invloed heeft op de beoordeling van de ontroerende versus grappige narratieve commercials. Door de lage betrouwbaarheid van de NFA emotie-benaderende dimensie is in dit onderzoek alleen de emotie-vermijdende dimensie van NFA gebruikt om NFA te meten.

In zijn navolging zijn veel ivoren diptieken uit de veertiende eeuw gelabeld als Frans. Toch was ook Keulen in de late middeleeuwen een productiecentrum van ivoorsnijkunst. In dit Bachelor-eindwerkstuk staan de verschillen tussen Keulse en Parijse ivoren diptieken centraal. 
Hoewel Keulen in de late middeleeuwen groter was dan Parijs, was de productie van ivoor er minder ver ontwikkeld. Keulse ivoorsnijders werkten dan ook naar Parijs voorbeeld. Zij raakten bekend met de Parijse stijl door terracotta voorbeeldmodellen. Hierdoor lijkt ivoorsnijkunst uit Keulen en Parijs op elkaar. 
Toch zijn er enkele kenmerken die Duitse ivoren diptieken onderscheiden van Franse, bijvoorbeeld de aanwezigheid van dakpannen en pinakels in de micro-architectuur van de diptieken. Ook de aanwezigheid van een bloedstraal uit de zijdewond van Christus die Maria raakt is een motief dat wijst op een Duitse herkomst, gebaseerd op het werk van de Duitse mysticus Heinrich Seuse (1295-1366). 
Deze en andere stilistische en iconografische kenmerken die wijzen op herkomst uit Keulen worden in dit eindwerkstuk verfijnd en toegepast op drie veertiende-eeuwse ivoren diptieken uit het Catharijneconvent, waaruit blijkt dat deze diptieken waarschijnlijk van Keulse afkomst zijn. Door uitwerking van de kenmerken die in dit eindwerkstuk worden samengebracht kunnen in de toekomst makkelijker en meer ivoren reliëfs aan Keulen worden toegeschreven."

sportfederaties zijn centrale actoren in de sportwereld die hieraan kunnen bijdragen. Het blijkt 
echter dat veel nationale sporfederaties nauwelijks tot geen milieuduurzaamheidsbeleid hebben 
(Geeraert, 2018). Daarom is onderzocht met welke uitdagingen nationale sportfederaties in de 
context van milieuduurzaamheid geconfronteerd worden en hoe zij hierop reageren. Hierbij is het 
perspectief van institutionele logica’s gebruikt. Er zijn interviews gehouden met senior 
beleidsmedewerkers en managers bij meerdere nationale sportfederaties waarvan de sport sterk 
verbonden is met de natuurlijke omgeving. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat nationale 
sportfederaties voornamelijk een sportlogica en een verenigingslogica hanteren. Verder worden in 
de institutionele omgeving een marktlogica en overheidslogica gehanteerd door stakeholders 
waarmee nationale sportfederaties in de context van milieuduurzaamheid mee te maken krijgen. 
Deze institutionele logica’s conflicteren met elkaar waarop nationale sportfederaties passend 
moeten reageren. Er zijn twee patronen gevonden in de reacties van nationale sportfederaties. Aan 
de ene kant een reactie van verlamming waarbij de nationale sportfederatie niet in staat bleek om 
een antwoord te vinden op de uitdagingen waarmee ze geconfronteerd worden. En aan de andere 
kant een reactie van het bijeenbrengen van de verschillende logica’s en partijen om ervoor te zorgen

Leiderschap: Een dam tegen de uitstroom? Een experimenteel onderzoek naar de invloed van leiderschapsstijlen op personeelsverloop in de zorg.,"['Vlis, E. van der']","['Vandenabeele, W.V.']",2021-09-01T18:00:40Z,nl,"['leiderschap, verloop, basic psychological needs satisfaction, zorgsector, zelforganiserende teams, experiment']",Strategisch Human Resource Management,"De zorgsector heeft al geruime tijd te maken met personeelstekorten. Dit probleem wordt in de toekomst alleen maar groter. Om deze tekorten terug te dringen lijkt met name het tegengaan van de uitstroom van personeel belangrijk. Eén van de voornaamste redenen voor personeel om te vertrekken is de aansturing door de leidinggevenden. De leidinggevende rol is in de afgelopen jaren veranderd doordat er steeds meer gebruik wordt gemaakt van zelfsturende en zelforganiserende teams. Leidinggevenden blijken echter soms moeite te hebben met het vinden van de juiste balans tussen sturing en autonomie bij het aansturen van deze teams.

Zowel vanuit wetenschappelijk, maatschappelijk als organisatorisch oogpunt zijn er redenen te benoemen waarom het belangrijk is om deze scriptie te richten op het verband tussen leiderschap en personeelsverloop bij zelforganiserende teams in de zorg. Zo laat wetenschappelijke literatuur bijvoorbeeld zien dat er nog veel onbekend is over hoe instrumenteel leiderschap zich verhoudt tot verloop, wat het onderliggende mechanisme is tussen leiderschap en verloop, hoe leiderschap bij zelforganiserende en zelfsturende teams het beste vorm kan krijgen en of relaties tussen leiderschap en uitkomsten ook daadwerkelijk causaal zijn. Hiernaast is dit onderzoek maatschappelijk en organisatorisch relevant omdat leidinggevenden van zelforganiserende teams momenteel rol ambiguïteit ervaren, er verschillende nadelige gevolgen zijn van de personeelstekorten voor zorgpersoneel, zorginstellingen en patiënten, sommige werknemers een lage mate van voorziening in de behoeften aan autonomie, competentie en verbondenheid ervaren en omdat veel organisaties gebruikmaken van zelfsturende of zelforganiserende teams.

Deze studie heeft tot doel om inzichtelijk te maken hoe groot de invloed van verschillende leiderschapsstijlen op de verloopintentie van zorgpersoneel is en in kaart te brengen in hoeverre de voorziening in de behoeften aan autonomie, competentie en verbondenheid dit verband medieert. In deze scriptie staat daarom de volgende vraag centraal: “In welke mate beïnvloeden transactioneel, transformationeel en instrumenteel leiderschap de verloopintentie van zorgpersoneel in zorgorganisaties die gebruikmaken van zelforganiserende teams en in hoeverre medieert de voorziening in de behoeften aan autonomie, competentie en verbondenheid dit verband?”

Op basis van literatuur over leiderschapsstijlen en de social exchange theorie wordt verwacht dat transactioneel leiderschap, indien vergeleken met transformationeel en instrumenteel leiderschap, een positieve invloed uitoefent op verloopintentie. Van de transformationele en de instrumentele leiderschapsstijlen wordt daarentegen verwacht dat zij, in verhouding tot transactioneel leiderschap, de verloopintentie zullen doen verminderen. Verder wordt naar aanleiding van de self-determination theorie verwacht dat de voorziening in de behoeften aan autonomie, competentie en verbondenheid het verband tussen de leiderschapsstijlen en de verloopintentie zal mediëren. Hierbij wordt verondersteld dat transactionele leidinggevenden de voorziening in behoeften verminderen en transformationele en instrumentele leidinggevenden juist wel voorzien in de behoeften. Indien er geen voorziening in de behoeften plaatsvindt dan zal dit leiden tot een hogere verloopintentie. Wanneer daarentegen wel wordt voorzien in de behoeften dan zorgt dit voor een lagere verloopintentie.

In de methode wordt beschreven dat er een experimenteel enquêteonderzoek wordt uitgevoerd om causaliteit vast te kunnen stellen. Hierbij worden zowel de leiderschapsstijlen als de behoeften gemanipuleerd. In de methode wordt verder toegelicht dat de steekproef bestaat uit Nederlands en
Belgisch zorgpersoneel. Ook worden de bevindingen van een aantal validiteits- en betrouwbaarheidstesten getoond. Bij verschillende van deze analyses wordt met twee steekproeven gewerkt. De steekproef voor toetsen gerelateerd aan hypothese 1 tot en met 3 bevat 185 respondenten. De omvang van de steekproef gericht op hypothese 4 tot en met 6 bedraagt 154 respondenten.

De resultaten geven weer dat transactioneel leiderschap leidt tot een hogere verloopintentie indien vergeleken met transformationeel en instrumenteel leiderschap. Transformationeel en instrumenteel leiderschap daarentegen zorgen voor een lagere verloopintentie wanneer deze stijlen worden vergeleken met transactioneel leiderschap. Hierbij is het effect van instrumenteel leiderschap op de verloopintentie significant groter dan het effect van transformationeel leiderschap. De verbanden tussen de leiderschapsstijlen en verloopintentie blijken te worden gemedieerd door de voorziening in de behoeften aan autonomie, competentie en verbondenheid. In tegenstelling tot transactioneel leiderschap voorzien transformationeel en instrumenteel leiderschap wel in de behoeften en leiden zo tot een lagere verloopintentie. Er zijn geen significante verschillen geconstateerd tussen transformationeel en instrumenteel leiderschap en de mate waarin deze leiderschapsstijlen voorzien in de behoeften.

In het discussie en conclusie hoofdstuk wordt weergegeven dat alle hypotheses worden ondersteund. Eveneens wordt aangegeven dat instrumenteel leiderschap op basis van dit onderzoek van meerwaarde blijkt te zijn en daarom een eigen plek inneemt binnen de theorie over leiderschap. Ook wordt beschreven hoe de social exchange theorie en de self-determination theorie aan elkaar gekoppeld kunnen worden. Verder gaat dit hoofdstuk in op de beperkingen van dit onderzoek door onder andere kanttekeningen te plaatsen bij verschillende vormen van validiteit. Vervolgens worden verscheidene aanbevelingen voor vervolgonderzoek geformuleerd. Hierna worden praktische aanbevelingen voor leidinggevenden binnen de zorg gegeven en wordt afgesloten met een slotoverweging."

Within the central European countries, within the European Union (EU), a relatively new network focused on infrastructure has emerged called the Three Seas Initiative (TSI). Within the EU there is another network with an infrastructure focus called the Trans-European Networks – Transport (TEN-T). These two networks have similar goals, to increase European infrastructural cohesion but have been structured differently with the TSI having no central organization to coordinate unlike the TEN-T which is coordinated by the EU Commission. Network governance theory argues that the structure of the network affects the traits of the network such as flexibility. Flexibility within infrastructure focused networks is an important trait to study due to the long-term nature of building infrastructure. Within this study the researcher applies network governance theory to a small-N case study of the TEN-T and the TSI comparing the two networks using co-variational analysis (COV). The independent variable that is studied is the existence of a network administrative organization (NAO) within the network. An NAO is present in the TEN-T and not present in the TSI which is classified as a participant-governed network. The dependent variable studied is the effect on flexibility. The hypothesis being that the existence of an NAO leads to lower flexibility within a network. The data was gathered using semi-structured interviews of ten civil servants from the TSI and the transcripts were analysed using thematic content analysis (TCA). The themes identified which indicate a high amount of flexibility are experimentation and confusion which was more prevalent in the TSI while themes indicating low flexibility are centralization and bureaucracy, these being more present in the TEN-T. In conclusion the study indicates that the TSI is more flexible than the TEN-T in response to the research question: How does the network organization of TSI and TEN-T affect their flexibility?"

These observations and maps were then supplemented with the children’s lived experiences. Children voiced their experiences by creating a mental map of their playground and then participating in a semi-structured interview. The outcomes of all these methods were then combined. The results indicated that the physical environment the children play in determines to a large extent the types of risky play the children can engage with. This engagement with risky play was found to be either encouraged by the Ravottuh supervisors while it was discouraged by their school’s teachers and parents. Children were able to regulate their risks and thereby enjoy risky play practices, although each child had created their own approach to doing so."

In such an acutely changing context, literature states that teachers need support at the individual, group and university level. This research includes an exploratory case study, consisting of interviews with 12 academic teachers of Utrecht University and an additional focus group with four faculty developers. The interview transcripts were analysed thematically. From the results it becomes clear that academic teachers are in need of support in times of ERT. The most important types of support are organised activities, meetings with colleagues and one-on-one meetings, where the support of colleagues stands out. These outcomes suggest further research in this field, a more in-depth study, including other aspects related to the need for support from academic teachers. This could further indicate the relevance of support in crisis situations."

Occasional evidence suggests psychological flexibility can protect individuals with PPS from the mental burden of their symptoms. However, to inform treatment, there is a need to replicate this finding as well as to identify which components of psychological flexibility buffer the relation between symptom severity and mental health. This study made use of the Flexibility Index Test (FIT-60) to measure psychological flexibility. The aim was to examine (1) the underlying components of psychological flexibility by performing a series of factor analyses on the data of a large sample (N = 1529), and (2) which factor-analytically derived components of psychological flexibility buffered the association between symptom severity and mental health in individuals with PPS (N = 429). Results suggested a two-factor solution, consisting of a mindfulness and acceptance factor and a commitment and behavior change factor. The first factor was found to buffer the association between symptom severity and mental health in individuals with PPS. The study provided insight into the role psychological flexibility components play in the mental health of individuals with PPS and the therapeutic approaches that might be most suitable to preserve mental health. The suggestion that mindfulness and acceptance processes mitigate the consequences of symptom severity on mental health more clearly than commitment and behavior processes, indicates that mindfulness and acceptance based management may be more fruitful than value and action based interventions for individuals with PPS. This should be examined in clinical experimental studies."
The Relationship between Childhood Trauma and Epistemic Trust: A cross-sectional Study,"['Driehuis, S.R.']","['Geenen, R.']",2021-09-07T18:00:27Z,en,['childhood trauma; epistemic trust; factor analysis; general population'],Clinical Psychology,"Abstract
Epistemic trust - the individual’s willingness to consider new knowledge from another person as trustworthy, generalizable, and relevant to the self - is considered predictive for treatment outcomes. Since epistemic trust is considered to have its roots in early development, traumatic experiences during childhood may be assumed to disrupt an individual’s epistemic trust. Understanding the structure of epistemic trust and how childhood trauma is related to it therefore might have useful clinical implications. The current study included 117 participants with a majority of highly educated people and women with an average age of 45 years old. The vast majority of the participants indicated that they had experienced no or a low degree of childhood trauma. The Questionnaire Epistemic Trust (QET), a newly developed questionnaire, was used to assess the degree of epistemic trust. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form was used to determine the degree and form of childhood trauma. Four factors were derived from the factor analysis: epistemic mistrust in the practitioner, suspiciousness, willingness to accept help and openness for information. Together, the dimensions explained 45.2 percent of the variance. Internal consistencies were .91, .87, .82 and .93, respectively. Results showed that individuals who experienced childhood trauma did not differ significantly on the four aspects of epistemic trust, compared to individuals without a history of childhood trauma. Ancillary analysis revealed that epistemic mistrust in the practitioner was increased in people with a history of physical abuse, sexual abuse and physical neglect, whereas suspiciousness was increased in people with a history of physical abuse, sexual abuse but not physical neglect. Willingness to accept help and openness for information were not affected by any form of childhood trauma. The results are promising and show the feasibility of further development and validation of the QET; also in clinical populations. Understanding the relationship between childhood trauma and epistemic trust can be used to better tailor the treatment to the specific characteristics of the patient."
The potential buffering role of soothers on the association between threats and the severity of somatic symptoms in individuals with fibromyalgia,"['Schuurman, M.']","['Geenen, R.']",2021-09-07T18:00:28Z,en,['Fibromyalgia; somatic symptoms; soothers; threats'],Clinical Psychology,"Introduction: According to the integrative model of fibromyalgia by Pinto et al. (2020b) that is based on the affect regulation model of Paul Gilbert, fibromyalgia is a result of an imbalance between the ‘threat’ and ‘soothing’ system. Literature suggests that threats can aggravate pain severity and that soothers may alleviate pain severity. The aim of this study was to examine whether threats and soothers, and the interaction between the two were associated with the severity of physical symptoms in fibromyalgia patients. It was predicted that threats would be positively associated with the severity of physical symptoms, that soothers would be negatively associated with the severity of physical symptoms and the effect of threats on the severity of physical symptoms would be reduced with a higher level of soothers. 
Methods: In total, 427 patients participated in this study, 404 female and 23 male with a mean age of 49.3 years of which 380 patients were included in the analyses because of missing values. Factor analysis was used to obtain a structured overview of the soothers and threats that were measured with a newly developed questionnaire. Multiple regression analyses was used to measure the association between the severity of symptoms measured by Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15) scores and the threats and soothers. Age was included as a covariate. A moderation analysis was conducted to examine whether the association between threats and somatic symptom severity was moderated by soothers. 
Results: A positive association between threats and the severity of physical symptoms was found. There was no association between soothers and the severity of physical symptoms. In addition, soothers did not moderate the relationship between threats and the severity of physical symptoms. 
Conclusion: The current study provides support for the relationship between threats and somatic symptom severity. However, there is no support for the association between soothers and the severity of somatic symptoms or a buffering role of soothers in the relationship between threats and somatic symptom severity. More work needs to be done researching this clinically relevant potential buffering role of soothers in the relationship between threats and somatic symptom severity in individuals with fibromyalgia."
"The effect of touch on itch
The influence of affective touch and interpersonal touch on itch relief","['Rahangmetan, B.']","['Dijkerman, C.']",2021-09-07T18:00:28Z,en,[],Neuropsychology,"Introduction: Itch is caused by a variety of conditions, but for some patients effective treatment is
still lacking. Itch is processed via unmyelinated C-fibers and is influenced by counter stimuli that
rely on similar fibers. Affective touch is a pleasant touch that relies on a subgroup of C-fibers (CTafferents) and could be effective for itch relief. CT-afferents are shown to respond optimally to
typical skin temperature, thus the present study investigates whether interpersonal touch has an
additional relieving effect on itch.
Methods: Itch was electrically induced in four touch conditions: 1) impersonal non-affective touch,
2) impersonal affective touch, 3) interpersonal non-affective touch and 4) interpersonal affective
touch. A brush was used for impersonal touch and fingers of the experimenter for interpersonal
touch, with slow strokes (3cm/s) for affective touch and fast strokes for non-affective touch (18 cm/
s). The duration of a condition was 10 minutes, with 5 itch measurements on a VAS-scale.
Results: This study showed that affective and interpersonal touch do not have a greater relieving
effect on itch compared to non-affective and impersonal touch. In addition, no relationship between
the experienced pleasantness of touch and itch relief was found.
Conclusion: This study could not provide supporting evidence that optimal CT-afferents activation
by touch has an additional relieving effect on itch. An attention effect is proposed as alternative
explanation. In order to draw firm conclusions, further research with methodological adjustments is
needed."

Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat er publieke aandacht was in de landen naar de opstand, maar dat dit toendertijd niet als de belangrijkste gebeurtenis werd gezien dat zich op dat moment afspeelde. De krantenartikelen gingen voornamelijk over de hulp die Warschau nodig had om de opstand succesvol te maken. Een ander groot deel van de krantenartikelen behandelde de vooruitgang van de opstand, hoewel dit in de Amerikaanse berichtgeving een stuk minder was dan bij de Britse berichtgeving. Ook is gebleken dat de Amerikaanse berichtgeving veel vaker heeft gesproken over de rol van de Sovjet-Unie in de opstand. Daarnaast sprak de Britse berichtgeving vaker met lof over de Poolse strijders, terwijl de Amerikaanse berichtgeving meer vasthield aan het feit dat de opstand zonder hulp zou mislukken."

It focuses on how Dutch identity is constructed and the racist and anti-immigrationist dimensions of Wilders' and his supporters’ discourses which deny migrants and people of colour “membership” of Dutch identity.

For these purposes, ​this thesis engages in a case study analysis of comments on posts about Akwasi from Wilders’ Facebook page. These comments have been analysed quantitatively with a word cloud and qualitatively with the method of critical discourse analysis (CDA). By using the concepts of “Othering” and “white innocence,” this thesis argues that the discourses of the case study construct migrants and people of colour as “Others” of a white, native Dutch ""Self.""

Uit eerder receptieonderzoek naar tienerdramaseries blijkt dat morele thema’s in tienerdramaseries, zoals seksualiteit of zelfdoding, morele paniek kunnen veroorzaken of geprezen worden voor het doorbreken van taboes. In die onderzoeken is zowel sprake van een youth-at-risk discours als een neoliberaal discours. Dat is opvallend, aangezien het youth-at-risk discours tieners representeert als irrationeel en kwetsbaar en het neoliberaal discours het idee reproduceert dat tieners welbewust en rationeel zijn. Met behulp van een grounded theory approach zijn Nederlandse krantenartikelen over tienerdramaseries aan een discoursanalyse onderworpen. Uit die analyse blijkt dat ook het Nederlandse discours over tienerdramaseries zowel youth-at-risk als neoliberale ideeën reconstrueert. Journalisten reconstrueren het beeld van een irrationele tiener, zodat zij tieners binnen dominante normen kunnen houden. Dat sluit aan bij het youth-at-risk discours doordat volwassenen tieners ‘beschermen’. Daarmee in tegenspraak wordt de verantwoordelijkheid voor risicovermijding toegeschreven aan tieners en hun ouders zelf. Daardoor houden journalisten het neoliberale ideaal in stand waarbij iedereen verantwoordelijk is voor zijn eigen welzijn. Ook oefenen journalisten disciplinaire macht uit, door zelfdoding wel en fatshaming niet als een (waardig) probleem te definiëren en voor te schrijven hoe tieners daarmee om moeten gaan."

Op het album Joy As An Act Of Resistance (2018) wordt het onderwerp masculiniteit vaak aangesneden door de band, specifiek op de tracks “Colossus” en “Samaritans”. Deze twee tracks dienen als casestudies waarvan tekst en muzikale ondersteuning geanalyseerd worden vanuit een sociologisch perspectief. In deze twee songs levert de band expliciet kritiek op de normen van masculiniteit waaraan mannen zouden moeten voldoen. De tekst van de songs reikt van persoonlijke ervaringen omtrent deze normen van zanger Joe Talbot tot een beschrijving van het effect van deze normen op mannen in het algemeen. Dit geheel wordt ondersteund door een instrumentatie die de tekst meer impact weet te geven door de hevige punk arrangementen. Deze scriptie maakt gebruik van wetenschappelijke publicaties van onder anderen R.W. Connell en Sam de Boise als theoretisch kader om uit te leggen hoe masculiniteit een niet eenduidig te definiëren concept is en onderdeel is van een grotere wetenschappelijke structuur. Er wordt uitgegaan van het normatieve perspectief op masculiniteit zoals omschreven door Connell. De soorten masculiniteit waarop IDLES kritiek leveren komen overeen met dit normatieve perspectief. IDLES lijken op het eerste gezicht mannen te zijn die dit perspectief van masculiniteit uitdragen, maar doen dit om mensen die in het perspectief geloven van mening te doen veranderen."

Leesinstructies bieden potentie om dit te verbeteren. Daarom bestudeert dit onderzoek het effect van verschillende leesinstructies op de leestijden en accurate detectie van incorrecte informatie. Daarnaast wordt er gecontroleerd voor de mogelijke invloed die iemands voorkennis hierop heeft. 68 HBO en WO geschoolde deelnemers van 18-35 jaar namen deel aan het onderzoek. Zij kregen een leesinstructie die hen ofwel deed focussen op het controleren van de informatie met hun achtergrondkennis, ofwel op het controleren van de informatie op coherentie met de tekst. Vervolgens lazen zij zin voor zin 16 teksten, waarvan de targetzinnen variërend correct of incorrect waren. Hierbij werden hun leestijden gemeten en hoe accuraat zij incorrecte informatie opmerkten. Om te controleren voor de invloed van iemands voorkennis is dit als co-variabele meegenomen. Resultaten laten zien dat leesinstructies die focussen op de tekst leiden tot langere leestijden van incorrecte informatie, maar leesinstructies die focussen op achtergrondkennis leiden tot een accuratere detectie. Voorkennis blijkt geen invloed te hebben op de leestijden en accurate detectie. Dit benadrukt het belang van het aandachtig formuleren van leesinstructies.

Due to an absence of Conversation Analysis (CA) studies into the phenomenon of individual plurilingualism, little is known about its interactional consequences or its manifestation in conversational activities. This research explores the relationship between plurilingualism and conversational repair, an activity that can be enacted on one’s own talk (self-repair) or on the talk of another (other-repair). Schleghoff et al. (1977) note that the face-threatening nature of repair gives rise to a preference for self-repair in almost all contexts. However, Norrick (1991) finds that certain speaker dynamics – such as those in teacher/student or native/non-native speaker configurations – can disrupt this organization of repair. This study takes 11 conversations between native and non-native speakers of English as its CA corpus, where the 11 native speakers represent varied PPC scores. The study looks for evidence of repair preferences indexing speaker orientations to linguistic power asymmetries. Analysis reveals that both more and less plurilingual native speakers display a preference for self-repair in conversations with non-native speakers, although native speakers who score higher on the PPC scale tend to orient to the NNS status of their interlocutor and employ a pedagogical stance more readily than those who score lower on the PPC scale."

The first is Americans’ motivation to learn Dutch, and the second is their evaluations of interactions with Dutch interlocutors. Participants’ stories are discussed through the framework of complexity in intercultural communication, supported by ideas concerning language learning motivation and accommodation strategies, as well as Schumann’s (1986) Acculturation Model of second language acquisition. The results indicate that participants are highly motivated to learn Dutch through a variety of internal and external factors, and they have varying opinions on what constitutes over- and under-accommodation. Americans’ intentions to use either English or Dutch depend on their communicative goals, which may change from one interaction to another. Communication between Americans and Dutch people is complex, because the meanings that Americans interpret from their interactions depend on their perceptions of themselves and their interlocutors, as well as their interlocutors’ perceptions of them."

especially in the international labour market. Research has shown that intercultural competences bring
both individual as well as societal benefits. There is an assumption that students from international
school have a higher intercultural sensitivity due to increased mobility and contact with other cultures.
Research has also mainly focused on foreign language acquisition when it comes to intercultural
competences. This master thesis aims to investigate how much intercultural competences are
integrated in the foreign language teaching and ultimately to what extent a multicultural and
multilingual environment plays a role in the development of such competences. The research was done
by using two models; the INCA framework, a European Union project to complement the already
existing CEFR, and Deardorff’s circular model of IC development. The study was done via quantitative
research, namely two surveys with students and former students of the European School of Varese,
and qualitative research, namely interviews with current foreign language teachers of said school. The
findings showed that by attending an international school, students do in fact acquire intercultural
competences not only through the foreign language classroom but also by simply attending such a
school. It furthermore resulted that intercultural competences are as a matter of fact incorporated
into foreign language teaching, although not necessarily concretely. Therefore, it results that a solid
reference system for the assessment and development of intercultural competences in schools is still
missing."

De uitbraak van COVID-19 en als gevolg daarvan het thuiswerken als ‘nieuwe normaal’ hebben het gebruik van humor bemoeilijkt en het gevoel van betrokkenheid onder medewerkers doen afnemen (Redactie MT/Sprout, 2021). Dit onderzoek beschrijft daarom de relatie tussen de perceptie van humor op de werkvloer en de mate van inclusie ervaren door medewerkers van Olam Cocoa, een internationale organisatie verantwoordelijk voor de distributie van cacao over de hele wereld (Olam, 2021). 
Aan de hand van de twee gevalideerde instrumenten, namelijk de Humor Climate Questionnaire (Cann e.a., 2014) en de Perceived Group Inclusion Scale (Jansen e.a., 2014), is er correlatieonderzoek uitgevoerd om het verband tussen humor en inclusie binnen een internationale organisatie vast te stellen. Uit de resultaten is gebleken dat er een positief verband bestaat tussen humor en inclusie, wat betekent dat een positieve perceptie van het humorklimaat samenhangt met een hoge mate van inclusie. Daarnaast is gebleken dat vormen van negatieve humor in verband staan met een lagere mate van inclusie. Waar het gebruik van negatieve vormen van humor het best vermeden kan worden om het gevoel van inclusie onder medewerkers hoog te houden, zou de relatie tussen positieve humor en inclusie organisaties juist uit kunnen nodigen om het gebruik van deze vormen van humor in te zetten om het gevoel van inclusie onder medewerkers te bevorderen. 
Ook bevestigt onderhavig onderzoek het belang van de steun vanuit leidinggevenden voor het gebruik van humor op de werkvloer, omdat deze steun in positief verband staat met een groot betrokkenheidsgevoel onder medewerkers. Het feit dat humor zeer cultuurgebonden is en dat een diverse, interculturele werkvloer kan leiden tot verdeelde gevoelens van inclusie, blijkt in deze casestudy geen valkuil te zijn. Het humorklimaat wordt door Nederlandse en niet-Nederlandse medewerkers van Olam Cocoa gelijkwaardig en overwegend positief ervaren en medewerkers met verschillende achtergronden voelen zich gelijkwaardig betrokken bij de organisatie.

Using theories on cultural memory by Ann Rigney, Pierre Nora and Astrid Erll, this thesis analyses how the song lyrics of The Smiths and slowthai serve as manifestos of dissent, and how this results in the construction of ‘sites of memory’: their lyrics serve as a device which remember and mediate a version of Britain’s past. Through close reading of the song lyrics of The Smiths’ The Queen Is Dead and slowthai’s Nothing Great About Britain, I argue that by painting a picture that highlights the struggles of the working class and shows an underside of Britain which counters the dominant imaginary, both The Smiths and slowthai – albeit in different ways – shape how we remember the state of Britain in the respective time periods."

With approximately twenty thousand inhabitants by the end of the century it was the biggest city of the northern Netherlands, it was the political and ecclesiastical centre of the diocese, and it had a long tradition of manuscript and sculpture production. Nevertheless, concerning the production of panel painting little seems to have survived. This has raised doubts about the importance of Utrecht painters in the fifteenth century among art historians. In this thesis the issue of the importance of Utrecht is re-examined in two chapters. The first chapter describes the existing debate on Utrecht fifteenth century panel painting, covering the leading authors within this field of study, like most notably Hoogewerff, Châtelet, and Defoer. The second chapter concentrates on Utrecht cityscapes on fifteenth and early sixteenth century paintings, with the aim to examine to which extent the identification of buildings results in reliable attributions of these artworks to Utrecht workshops. It became clear that it is indeed difficult to locate an Utrecht school of painting within the confines of the city. However, the importance of Utrecht-trained panel painters did exist outside of the city, with skilled artists active in Flanders and the Lower Rhine region."

The closure of schools through the pandemic occurred during a century that has been shaped by digitalisation in educational contexts (Selwyn, 2012). Faculty readiness for online teaching is a major component that determines the success of online education (Martin et al., 2019). This study investigates whether teachers actually felt ready to teach online (Brooks & Grajek, 2020) and whether educational institutions were able to adapt to online teaching in such a massive manner (Carey, 2020). The aim of this study is gaining insight in how COVID-19 changed the perceptions of teachers in the Netherlands towards their readiness for online teaching and comparing these perceptions for different educational levels (MBO, HBO and WO). This study also focuses on examining hindering or stimulating factors for teachers in online teaching. A quantitative survey study was conducted and Mixed Model ANOVA and ranking scores were used in order to answer the research questions. The results show that the perceptions of teachers’ readiness for online teaching before COVID-19 changed in comparison to during COVID-19. Among all educational levels, a change in the readiness for online teaching was found but the expected differences among educational levels were not significant. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that lack of interaction is identified as most hindering factor, while innovation is identified as most stimulating factor."

Despite these characteristics, zircons have been found which show textures evident of zircon recrystallisation. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for zircon recrystallisation and their effect on trace element mobility is of vital importance for correctly interpreting U-Pb ages of zircons. In this study both igneous and metamorphic zircons form the Jack Hills Metasedimentary Belt in Western Australia, and the granitic injection complex of Harris in North-west Scotland have been studied. Cathodoluminescence (CL), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and wavelength dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) imaging reveal that recrystallisation in the studied zircons is often characterised by 1) a translation, bending and fading of the oscillatory zoning, 2) a structural recovery of the zircon, 3) an enrichment in Hf and depletion in Y in recrystallised zircon and 4) the formation of a recrystallisation interface with a minor (&lt; 2°) misorientation. A mechanism of trace element and dislocation migration is expected to be acting shortly after crystallisation during the cooling of the magma, as similarly described by Hoskin and Black (2000). However, an addition is made to this mechanism as the accumulation of dislocations is expected to form dislocation arrays which act as fast-diffusion pathways supporting pipe diffusion as proposed by (Piazolo et al., 2016). During this process, fluids ingress along these fast-diffusion pathways supplying Hf which is incorporated in the recrystallised zircon. After this recrystallisation event, subsequent metamictization of the primary oscillatory zoning may be structurally recovered by a mechanism of diffusion-reactionre-equilibration (Geisler et al., 2007). The implications of zircon recrystallisation on U-Pb dating are that because of the heterogeneous distribution of trace elements, spots for SHRIMP analysis must be carefully chosen. It must be considered that the recrystallisation expulsed U, which results in a lesser degree of metamictization within recrystallised zircon. For this reason recrystallised zircon may reflect the age of crystallisation better than zoned zircon, which may have experienced a Pb loss event via diffusion through metamictization induced fast-diffusion pathways."
"Real-time drought and landslide monitoring in the Trishuli catchment, Nepal","['Leijnse, M.']","['Immerzeel, W.W.', 'Steiner, J.F.']",2021-09-07T18:01:49Z,en,['Rainfall-triggered landslides; Droughts; Central Nepal; Trishuli; Hazard monitoring'],Earth Surface and Water,"Its high-relief topology, active seismic zone, and intense summer monsoons make Nepal very prone to the occurrence of multiple hazards, among which droughts and landslides (MoHa, 2019). The impact of droughts on the food security and economic development in Nepal is considerable since 65% of the households relies on rain-fed farming (FAO, 2020). Also, landslides have a large impact on the liveability in Nepal, causing considerable economic losses and fatalities every year (Petley et al., 2007); in 2017 and 2018 a total of 484 landslides were reported in Nepal, leading to 161 casualties and an economic damage of 1.6 million USD (MoHa, 2019). To improve drought and landslide risk awareness and preparedness, real-time monitoring of these hazards is necessary. Although many systems monitoring these hazards have been developed and implemented, these systems or their applications often only provide hydrometeorological information displayed on low spatial resolution. There is, however, a need for information that is comprehensible, directly applicable, and, therefore, helpful to drought and landslide risk awareness and early warning on local scale. Therefore, this study has investigated methodologies and visual output for a multi-hazard monitoring model that provides accessible information on agricultural drought occurrence and rainfall-triggered landslide potential in the Trishuli river basin of Central Nepal. These methodologies use meteorological variables at point scale obtained from ECMWF’s ERA5 product that is downscaled with meteorological station measurements at different locations throughout the catchment area. For the monitoring of drought impact on rice, wheat, and maize production a visualisation is developed, indicating crop seasonal water availability based on the estimation of Makkink evapotranspiration and a subsequent climatic water balance. Landslide risk has been estimated by comparing the daily index of antecedent rainfall (ARI) to a threshold of extreme antecedent conditions. Although inaccuracies exist for these methods in establishing drought and landslide extent or potential, all methodologies are easy to implement and provide comprehensible insights on landslide or drought occurrence on station scale. Therefore, it is suggested to apply the developed methodologies to real-time or forecasting meteorological measurements to provide real-time monitoring and early warning of landslide and drought occurrence in Central Nepal."
"Exploration and Assessment of the Governance and Management
of the Electrical and Electronic Waste Sector in Italy.","['Zabeo, D.']","['Vermeulen, W.J.V.', 'Campbell-Johnston, K.A.']",2021-09-02T18:00:20Z,en,"['Electrical and Electronic Waste, E-waste, Italy, EPR.']",Sustainable Development,"Electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest-growing waste streams that is currently generated. Solid waste is a threatening issue, but e-waste is particularly toxic and urgent. It contains chemicals and materials that if not correctly dispose of are toxic for human health and extremely polluting for the environment.
This research aimed at comprehending the governance and organizational structure and the stakeholders’ dynamics in a system adopting the EPR approach. To increase the general comprehension of EPR implementation and e-waste governance, the thesis focused on the governance and management of e-waste and the EPR system, with a case study in Italy.
The governance and the organization of e-waste management were firstly studied through a policy analysis. Linked to this the performances of e-waste collection have been analysed between 2005 and 2020, to assess if the policy intentions were achieved in the performances. In parallel, a stakeholder analysis was performed. The result of this first phase showed that Italy built a complex bureaucratic system to fulfil EPR responsibilities, that are divided among various actors. The political sector appears quite lacking compared to the business sector that is efficient and technologically advances. The EPR implementation positively influenced the collection rate, efficiency, and recycling rates. However, the performances did not meet the European target and different areas need to be improved. To identify these areas, the strengths and weaknesses of the Italian system were assessed through a framework with 4 categories and 21 indicators. The framework was based on the study of the strength and weaknesses of the EPR systems and the success factors and implementations barriers for efficient e-waste management. Considering that Italy is vulnerable to criminal activities, a set of indicators to test the vulnerability of the system to criminality were added to the assessment framework. The analysis showed the main weaknesses relates to a legislation and regulation system, weak control and inspection mechanisms, a strong presence of the informal sector and free riders. Lastly, the ERP system implemented in Italy, as in many other countries, does not contribute significantly to the achievement of the eco-design goal."
"Effect of quartz on antigorite gouges: friction decrease by talc
formation or pressure solution.","['Thij, L. ten']","['Niemeijer, Andre']",2021-09-07T18:01:51Z,en,[],Earth Structure and Dynamics,"Normally conditions in the forearc mantle wedge would cause stick-slip behaviour. However, the
forearc mantlewedge shows aseismic behaviour. Sections of the San Andreas fault also showaseismic
behaviour. Previous work suggested that serpentine was the cause of this aseismic behaviour,
in both forearc mantle wedges and the San Andreas fault. However, serpentine normally experiences
temperature strengthening and causes stick-slip in laboratory experiments, which means that
other weakening mechanisms are causing the aseismic behaviour.D E Moore et al., 2013 showed
that when serpentine is sheared against quartz it experiences decreasing friction with increasing
temperature. One explanation for this decrease could be the formation of talc due to its low friction
in comparison to serpentine. A reaction of serpentine with silica rich sources will form talc
which is stable over a wide range of temperature–pressure conditions and has a very low friction
coefficient. A second explanation is the activation of pressure solution which is activated by the
presence of quartz. Up till now, research on this topic has only been done up to temperatures of
350°C and few experiments have been conducted with quartz incorporated in the antigorite gouge.
In this research I show the effect of different weight percentages of quartz on the friction of antigorite
at temperatures up to 500°C. Experiments were conducted with the rotary shear aparatus at
different velocities. The experiments may give an insight in the frictional strength, expressed using
the rate and state parameters (a-b). Microstructural data of the experiments can give an insight in
the active deformation mechanisms in antigorite mixed with quartz during shearing. Experiments
conducted with antigorite containing quartz, show a significant decrease in friction and positive
(a-b) values which suggests that shearing is aseismic. Results from the microprobe, EDX and FTIR
prove the formation of talc during the experiments at temperatures of 500°C and the presence of
pressure-solution by pressure shadows and the dependence on grain size. In nature, these two
processes could be the cause of the aseismic behaviour within forearc mantle wedges and the San
Andreas fault."

Monitoring coral reefs is crucial but has its challenges since coral reefs are
dynamic and data is sensitive to weather conditions. This often leads to difficulties for acquiring accurate data. Coral reef surveys are normally done during ideal conditions which are not always available when researchers are present. That is only one of several challenging aspects in coral reef classification. This study explores the possibilities of applying deep learning to classify drone imagery from coral reefs as a promising new approach for coral reef classification, but also as a new approach for producing geophysical output. This study also explores if it is possible to classify non ideal shore imagery. The possibility to work with non ideal imagery would provide more options for the analysis of coral reef surveys. The images are classified using a segmentation approach with a convolutional neural network. The binary classifications achieve high accuracies of 94% and 96% and IoU values of 77% and 71%. From the segmented output a coral density map is derived. The production of the coral density map is the one of the final
steps towards producing promising geophysical output. The classification of non ideal imagery led to some difficulties, but it should be possible to fully correctly classify those as well, which can be discussed in further research"
Surface water simulation with the PyCatch model and verification with remote sensing data for malaria prediction,"['Zhang, H.']","['Karssenberg, D.J.', 'Sutanudjaja, E.H.']",2021-09-07T18:01:55Z,en,"['PyCatch, model, malaria, soil moisture']",Earth Surface and Water,"Malaria affects more than 200 million people in the world each year. It is increasingly restricted to tropical and subtropical areas, especially in Africa, resulting in lower dependence on air temperature, so more attention is paid to modeling malaria with surface water processes in recent years. The PyCatch model enables dynamically simulating the processes of interception, evapotranspiration, surface storage, infiltration, subsurface flow, and overland flow. To examine the PyCatch capability in simulating malaria-relevant surface water processes, we applied the PyCatch model to a small catchment and evaluated the model performance in discharge and soil moisture simulation. The results show the consistency between PyCatch hydrograph and other global hydrological models, and the PyCatch skillfulness in discharge simulation. The soil moisture simulated by PyCatch is stable and has evident seasonal and interannual variation patterns, despite some differences against the remote sensing data. Through linear regression, PyCatch is proved to be competent for malaria burden prediction."
"Numerical comparison between RAMMS debris flow simulations and actual events in the Illgraben catchment area, Switzerland","['Roos, C.M.']","['Wiebe Nijland, Tjalling de Haas']",2021-09-07T18:01:53Z,en,[],Earth Surface and Water,"Debris flows can become hazardous in mountainous areas when growing to large volumes. The main mechanism causing a debris flow to reach a large volume is erosion. The RAMMS model has shown to be successful in simulating debris flow events realistically. However, this model still has shortcomings, of which erosion is the most important one. At the moment, erosion in RAMMS is poorly studied.  In this research, actual measured debris flows were compared to simulated debris flow events in RAMMS to take a closer look at how the RAMMS model performs in terms of erosion. Two debris flow events, one very erosive and the other less erosive, were analysed with a quantitative GIS erosion and deposition analysis. This study shows that RAMMS is able to successfully simulate less erosive debris flows, but when a debris flow is very erosive, the simulated erosion is very different from the actual event. A reason for this could be that the erosive event had certain parameters without erosive properties, or that the many check dams along the channel prevented most erosion. Nevertheless, it shows that future research on how RAMMS performs in terms of erosion is crucial for successfully forecasting debris flows in the future, as erosive debris flows can be most hazardous when they grow to large volumes."

The n−level correlation function of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta functions are studied, which Montgomery conjectured to be the same as for the Gaussian unitary ensemble. The Riemann zeta function is part of the Dirichlet L-functions, and their zeros all exhibit the same statistics. Chaotic quantum systems also show the same statistics in their energy levels. Using quantum billiards as an example, we show that chaotic motion in the billiard leads to Gaussian level spacing. The boundary roughness and effect of time-reversal symmetry breaking are also discussed."

I develop this further to describe the geodesics of general relativity and finally apply this to a new theory called ’Einstein-scalar- Gauss-Bonnet’ gravity in which we calculate the photon trajectories near black holes. An interesting feature in this new theory is that black holes in EsGB gravity are scalarized, also called scalar hair. In this gravity theory I use the frame of the ’observer’s sky’ to plot the shadow of a black hole and discover the radius of the shadow shrinks compared to general relativity for any value of the new parameters of the theory within the validity of my approximation. I also give an analytical approximation for expressing the radius of the shadow and compare it to the numerically found values. This analytical expression is dependent on the black hole mass and parameters of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory and agrees remarkably well for in the small coupling regime."

The altered DICE-model integrates economics, carbon cycle, climate science, and the weighing of costs, resulting in agents guessing benefits of taking steps to slow down climate change.  Geo-engineering is seen as a possible cheap alternative solution to slow down global warming, which could mean a slower transition to green energy.

important features of quantum gravity. One such problem involves the black hole information paradox.
From the discovery of Hawking radiation on, for years, physicists have tried find out the precise mechanism
by which information of matter, that collapses into a black hole during the formation process, can be
retrieved from its Hawking radiation at later times. It is essential to understand how unitarity is preserved
in semi-classical or quantum gravity, in order to exclude the possibility of information loss.
In this thesis, we dive into black holes and the information paradox. In order to understand black holes
and the information paradox, we investigate the fundamental theories of quantum mechanics and general
relativity. Hereafter we take a look at important properties of black holes, and the emergence of Hawking
radiation. Next, we study the information paradox and especially the Page curve closely, just as proposed
solutions to the paradox. We also take a look at the AdS/CFT-duality, from which becomes clear that
information is preserved. Finally, we will explore recent advances in the field by Alhmeiri et al. (2019)
and Penington et al. (2019). These studies provide a possible explanation to the information problem by
a new mechanism for information retrieval, called ”islands”. We arrive at a unitary Page curve via the
island formula, a gravitational fine-grained entropy formula for the Hawking radiation. The island formula
is derived from the replica trick by including new saddles: the replica wormholes."

It is still being intensively researched, because it is very interesting. The exciton is an excitation of a topological insulator. We want to know all the properties of the edge states of topological insulators in one dimension. More specifically, we want to know the wave function and its energy. We found that edge states always have the same energy as the energy halfway the band gap. And that the wave functions peak at the topological side of the edge. We also found that we can rewrite the Hamiltonian to that of the Zeeman interaction, from which we can deduce the topological class of the Hamiltonian. The difference in topological classes explains why the edge states always have the same energy as halfway the band gap. Because the boundary between the topological classes has that energy. By researching the properties of edge states of a topological insulators in one dimension, we can obtain more knowledge about excitons and their edge states in the future."

The occupational structure of regions is continuously altered by the progress of automation technology. At the same time, regional inequality is growing across European regions, with automation being one of the primary causes. Because automation impacts tasks and jobs differently, the same holds true for regions: jobs are not necessarily lost and created in the same locations. This study builds on the analysis on occupation automation risk conducted by Frey & Osborne (2017), and proposes the use of regional automation resilience as a measure for regional inequality, by looking at the job loss risks and job creation abilities of 21 Swedish regions. The analysis finds small regional differences in mean automation risk, and substantial regional inequality in terms of job creation potential and job creation ability. Furthermore, it finds that low-risk job creation, while addressing the growing skills mismatch, is the key to maintaining wage growth and improving living standards within regions."
