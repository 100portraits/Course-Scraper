The Effect of Tax Expenditures on Inward FDI: Evidence from OECD Countries,"['Vorsteveld, Luc']","['Rossel Flores, Lucia']",2022-08-09T00:02:53Z,EN,['Foreign Direct Investment; Tax Expenditures; Taxation; Multinational Corporations; investment'],Economic Policy,"This study analyses the effect of tax expenditures on FDI stocks in OECD countries, using a clustered fixed effects model. The contribution of this study is that FDI is not influenced by the nominal tax rate, but by the special provisions made for the tax levied on companies. Using the newly released GTED database on tax expenditures, this study finds that tax expenditures as a percentage of the tax revenue have a significant effect on FDI stocks held by OECD countries between 2005 and 2020. The effect is robust to the addition of the nominal tax rate and other control variables. The conclusion of this study is that the fiscal environment shaped by national governments and tax agencies significantly impacts the investment decisions of MNEs."
The Effect of cultural distance on the internationalization process of FinTech companies,"['Khedmati, Mohsen']","['Kunst, Vincent']",2022-08-09T00:02:46Z,EN,"['Culture, Cultural distance, Internationalization process, FinTech firms, Uppsala Model, Eclectic Paradigm, OLI Framework, Born Globals']",International Management,"During recent decades, digital services have markedly influenced people's lives as well as the world economy. Although financial services were the slowest industry in terms of digitalization, nevertheless, the emergence of fintech firms led to the rising of severe challenges to traditional banking and financial services. This study aims to investigate the internationalization of fintech companies and the effect of the cultural differences on the location choice process. to do so, this study was based on a multiple-case analysis and samples selected from CFTE’s top unicorn fintech firms. The author proved that fintech firms, in contrast to other digital companies, tend to internationalize following the Uppsala school of thought model, which means that they begin their internationalization process within culturally closer countries. Furthermore, it was proved that fintech firms follow an incremental cultural distance sequence in their internationalization plan. In addition, this study focused more on the development level of home base countries. It investigated whether or not the development level of home countries has a relationship with the location choice based on cultural distance. Despite previous literature claiming that firms from developing countries tend to expand internationally from more culturally distant and developed countries, this study proved that fintech firms from developing countries are the exception to this claim."
Measuring well-being and sustainability: irreconcilably opposed or inevitably linked?,"['Janssen, Harold']","['Boumans, Marcel']",2022-08-09T00:02:54Z,EN,['well-being; sustainability; measurement; economic methodology; case-study analysis;'],Economic Policy,"This thesis is an inquiry into the complexity of well-being measurement, especially when attempting to incorporate sustainability. To analyze the dynamics between these two contested concepts in social sciences, I compare three measures of (sustainable) well-being: the Brede Welvaartsindicator, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Monitor Brede Welvaart. The three steps of measurement developed by Cartwright and Runhardt (2014) guide the analysis, which is performed through desk research, semi-structured interviews and a newly developed typology of well-being indicators. The analysis shows that each of the current measures of (sustainable) well-being is imperfect. Using this, I identify four fundamental problems which any researcher in well-being measurement must relate to. Finally, I translate the lessons learned into practical recommendations for the improvement of the Brede Welvaartsindicator. Most importantly, I argue that this measure would benefit from the inclusion of capital stock indicators to represent the sustainability of current well-being in relation to future generations."

Private Sector Involvement in Climate Adaptation: Studying the Role and Level of Engagement of the Private Sector in Public-Private Partnerships for Food Security in the Global South and its Justice Implications,"['Zoetbrood, Alessa']","['Driessen, Peter']",2022-08-16T00:00:36Z,EN,['Climate Adaptation; Public-Private Partnerships; Justice; Private Sector Involvement; Food Security and Agriculture'],Sustainable Development,"Climate change poses an increasing risk to human and natural systems, and climate action is necessary to reduce these risks. The mobilisation of private sector investment and adaptation is needed but remains difficult. A strategy to encourage private sector engagement is through public-private partnerships. However, public-private partnerships are not always effective, and private sector engagement is sometimes still low in public-private partnerships. Furthermore, the desired higher private sector involvement could raise questions about the inclusiveness of vulnerable groups in these public-private partnerships. This research aims to investigate the role and level of engagement of the private sector, and its linked justice implications in public-private partnerships focused on food security adaptation in the global South. Stimulating and restrictive factors for the private sector to join the partnerships are additionally identified and used to explain the private sector involvement and justice implications. To do so, this research has conducted a case study analysis with four public-private partnerships concerned with agricultural adaptation in the global South. This research has conducted 15 interviews with case study actors, 4 expert interviews and a document analysis. An analytical framework has been applied to the case studies. This thesis shows that the private sector often plays a key role within the public-private partnerships and are responsible for the actual delivery of the program or project. Therefore, using public-private partnerships is an effective way to stimulate the private sector to help contribute to agricultural climate adaptation. Nonetheless, overall, the justice implications in the adaptation projects are mediocre, meaning that not all groups are included in the transition to a more climate-resilient future. No clear influence from the private sector involvement on the justice implications was found in this study. Nevertheless, the presence of an NGO and a smaller scale of a public-private partnership have been identified as a positive influence on the justice implications. These generated insights helped create a better understanding of the conditions that are necessary for reaching the vulnerable smallholders to increase their livelihoods. A one-size-fits-all approach is not effective for increasing the participation of the private sector, and also not for increasing the justice implications. A tailor-made approach to the specific context is needed to create a more effective and just transformation to a more climate-resilient future, which is needed to reduce the risks of climate change."
The Effect of Inner Dialogue and Awareness on Tolerance towards Transgender Youth: A Pretest-Posttest comparative study,"['Habib, Moska']","['Oosterwegel, Annerieke']",2022-08-14T23:00:39Z,EN,['tolerance increase; transgender youth; awareness; inner dialogue; pretest-posttest design; well-being'],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"In recent years, a lot of awareness has been raised about challenging stigma and intolerance which individuals from the transgender community face. Even though regulations and laws are evolving through more recognition and tolerance, prejudices and discrimination are still present. Especially transgender youth are experiencing various forms of bullying such as exclusion, swearing and even physical violence. Due to these stressors, many transgender youths develop mental health problem, such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse and suicide. The goal of this research was to investigate whether engaging in an inner dialogue can facilitate and increase tolerance. We further hypothesized, that more awareness can enhance tolerance towards people of the transgender community. This online study employed a three-group pre-test and post-test design, with participants placed in either an inner dialogue group, an awareness group, or a comparison group. Participants (n =156) were youth between the age 16 and 25. The transgender knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs scale (T-KAB) was used to measure the level of tolerance before and after each condition. A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine differences between the three conditions. Results indicated a significant difference between groups. Additionally, a post-hoc analysis showed, that awareness was a significant predictor for tolerance increase compared to the control group. Inner dialogue was found to increase tolerance, but the effect was not significant. However, our findings indicated a lack of difference between the inner dialogue condition and the awareness condition. Further research is needed to investigate the effect of inner dialogue on tolerance."
Reading Emotions: Automatic Recognition of Engagement Using Facial Expressions and Physiological Measures,"['Deniz, Fatih']","['Donker, Stella']",2022-08-14T23:00:37Z,EN,['Engagement; Engagement Measures; Electrodermal Activity; Eye-tracking; Facial Action Units; Engagement Recognition'],Applied Cognitive Psychology,"Engagement is a state of being involved, occupied, or fully absorbed in something, the advantage of engagement is widely known in the literature. Despite its importance, there are many methods for measuring engagement. This study utilizes both subjective and objective measures to investigate engagement by using facial action units, skin conductance, eye movements, and pupil diameter to understand how these measures are affected by engagement. The results indicated that there were some significant differences in measure when participants were engaged, compared to neutral and not engaged, but these changes were subtle and effect sizes were low. Similarly, multiple machine learning algorithms were failed to classify engagement using facial action units. One interpretation of these findings is that it was not possible to generate enough engagement responses with this experimental structure. On the other hand, another interpretation is that engagement itself in this specific context doesn't generate significant physiological responses."
The implications of the colonial history in delta planing - Delta planning for climate change in the Mekong Delta,"['Ha, Anne']","['Liebrand, Janwillem']",2022-08-16T00:00:33Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"The threat of climate change in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam is an overarching social justice issue which has to be understood for a sustainable solution. The Mekong Delta is one of the areas affected most by climate change in the world. This threatens the livelihoods of those living there and the overall food security in the world, as Vietnam is one of the biggest rice exporters in the world. The policies made for climate change adaptation are often rooted in engineering practices. Additionally, the Mekong Delta has a history of foreign interventions. From French colonialism to an American development model to a political-economical collaboration with the Netherlands. This research investigated how these foreign interventions implicate planning for climate change adaptation, especially looking at the Mekong Delta Plan and Resolution 120. The term coloniality is used for the remaining impact of colonialism and it also encompasses the superiority of the global North after the colonial era. The Colonial Matrix of Power is used to identify coloniality and it contains the struggle for economic control, the struggle for the control of authority, the control of public sphere and the control of knowledge and subjectivity. The Mekong Delta Plan is an example of the Dutch Delta approach where it is implied that Dutch knowledge in delta planning is advanced compared to the countries where the Dutch expertise ‘diffuses’ to. From a historical analysis, a professional actor analysis and a policy analysis, it becomes clear that the remains of the French colonial time still influence planning for climate change adaptation today. This is visible in the way that there is still a dependency on the construction of water management infrastructure today because of the technical interventions in the past. The financials costs of maintaining this infrastructure has led to the dependency of Vietnam on international donors. The plans from multiple international actors to develop the Mekong Delta stems from the fact that they consider the delta as underused. Land is only considered valuable if it has an economic output. By implementing development plans, these international actors exert power over the economic control and the control of authority. The control of knowledge and subjectivity is seen in the promotional text from the Dutch government. This interferes with the existing relationship between the professional communities of Vietnam and the Netherlands which are based on equality. It is argued that for more socially just climate change adaptation planning, future plans have to move away from delta exploitation and delta management approaches towards delta care practices."
"‘Interaction on peak, child can speak: The relationship between Parent-Child Interaction and Child’s Language Development with the moderating role of Perceived Stress and Working at Home or on Location.’","['Bartels, Marilou']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-08-16T00:00:38Z,EN,"['language development, parent-child interaction, young children, perceived \nstress, Covid-19']",Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"It is known that the interaction between parent and child plays an important role in the early and later language development of young children and that the perceived stress of parents can influence both aspects negatively. To determine if perceived stress can influence this relationship, this research investigates the moderating role of perceived stress of parents in the relationship between parent-child interaction and the language development of young children, looking at the difference between parents that work mostly at home and parents that work mostly on location. In a correlational research design, 224 parents of Dutch babies born during the first lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands and aged between 20 and 25 months old, completed a survey about the different subjects. The results show that parent-child interaction is related to child’s language development of children under the age of two. No effect is found for the moderating role of perceived stress. In addition, no effect is found for working at home or on location. As a result, it can be concluded that there is a relationship between parent-child interaction and a child’s language development. In order to clarify and counteract the negative consequences, follow-up research is recommended."

Classification of Coastal Dune Vegetation from Aerial Imagery with a Convolutional Neural Network,"['Kooij, Florine']","['Ruessink, Gerben']",2022-08-17T00:00:42Z,EN,['Coastal dunes; Ecology; Convolutional Neural Network; Vegetation mapping; Remote sensing'],Marine Sciences,"The Dutch coastal dunes house a rich and dynamic ecosystem with a large variation in habitats. However, they are currently threatened by geomorphological stabilization and subsequent encroachment of shrubs and tall grasses, which overtake valuable grey dune grassland. To understand such vegetation dynamics at larger scales, vegetation maps are key. While traditionally, constructing these maps from field surveys is very time- and cost-intensive, an alternative approach can be taken by training a machine learning model to classify vegetation from remote sensing data. A particularly promising model is the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of deep learning model specifically designed for pattern recognition, which has been proven highly accurate in mapping vegetation in various ecosystems. However, no vegetation mapping CNNs have been developed for coastal dune ecosystems yet.

In this thesis I present a CNN capable of mapping coastal dune vegetation on a plant community scale with an overall accuracy of 75%. The CNN has a U-net architecture and is trained for RGB orthophoto tiles with spatial dimensions of 10 by 10 m. First, a vegetation survey of the study site, the blowout complex north of Bloemendaal, was conducted to better understand its vegetation. Additionally, an Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle survey to obtain an orthophoto and additional elevation data of the study site was conducted. The CNN was trained using 112,500 m2 of manually classified vegetation maps as reference data. It was found that CNN performance per class is positively related to the surface area of that class in the reference data. Furthermore, increasing the input tile size was shown to increase overall CNN accuracy. Conversely, including elevation data as additional input information was not found to make a significant difference in CNN performance. These findings can contribute to improving the CNN further in the future.

The results of this thesis demonstrate that it is possible to use a CNN for mapping coastal dune vegetation, obtaining a vegetation map that is ecologically relevant and can be compared to other vegetation studies that use Natura 2000 habitat types. Although this CNN must still be optimized further, it could potentially be used for long-time and large-scale vegetation mapping, which could greatly improve our understanding of vegetation dynamics in coastal dune ecosystems."
A. bisporus food web reconstruction and nematode analysis by stable isotope probing,"['Marjanović, Lucija']","['Middelburg, Jack']",2022-08-17T00:00:44Z,EN,['compost nematodes; casing nematodes; nematode stable isotope analysis; PLFA biomarker; compost food web modelling'],"Earth, Life and Climate","The white button mushroom (A. bisporus) is one of the most important commercial mushroom cultivars worldwide, whose compost contains plentiful microbiota. However, little is known about the impact of nematodes on A. bisporus’ growth and the carbon flow in the compost. To investigate this, a 13C-glucose tracer study was performed, followed by counts of nematode densities which concluded with the build-up of a mathematical model of the carbon flow of this environment. First known application of LA-IRMS on nematodes for stable isotope analysis was performed, the results of which were coupled with results of PLFA biomarker studies, in order to build an interactive food web model for carbon flow tracing. Nematode population densities were shown to be too low to cause disease in A. bisporus primordia. Cultures without A. bisporus showed a lower overall number of nematodes than those with A. bisporus. Natural abundance δ13CVPDB measurements of nematodes agreed with literature values for soil nematodes and glucose tracer experiments suggested that nematodes uptake the tracer label indirectly through bacteria and fungi as second-level consumers. The model showed a drop in the bacterial and fungal biomass over the course of the experiment, with a simultaneous increase in A. bisporus biomass. Consistently with literature, simple sugars increased, and complex carbohydrates decreased over time, with increased emitted CO2. These findings highlight that nematodes in commercial A. bisporus mushroom beds do not present danger to the mycelium, with A. bisporus acting as a direct competitor to nematode populations, which consume bacteria and fungi and in doing so, support carbon flow as top-level consumers."
Drivers and Barriers to Accelerating the Plant-Based Dairy Alternatives Innovation System – The Case of the Netherlands,"['Vossen, Fleur van der']","['Negro, Simona']",2022-08-16T00:01:27Z,EN,"['Plant-based dairy alternatives, technological innovation system, protein transition']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Increasing pressures on current practices related to dairy production and consumption have urged societies to explore more sustainable alternatives. In this respect, plant-based alternatives to dairy (PBD) products have emerged as a more environmentally responsible option. In the Netherlands, the market for plant-based dairy alternatives has developed as an upcoming niche over the past decades. With a dairy industry that is embedded in its economy and institutions, this country makes for an interesting case to study the dynamics between the upcoming niche and the established regime. The framework of technological innovation systems (TIS) has been applied as the theoretical fundament to analyze this PBD transition. With incorporating developments of both niche and regime processes, this study aims to investigate the diffusion of PBD in the Netherlands, as well as the interactions of established incumbents and their involvements in the PBD innovation system. In doing so, this research has identified several barriers that may hamper the acceleration of this innovation system, which have been linked to the theory of systemic problems. Accordingly, this study has conducted a qualitative event- history analysis from 2006-2022, alongside qualitative interviews with stakeholders of the PBD innovation system. Findings indicate several systemic barriers to PBD acceleration. First, this study identified hard institutional failures that result in misalignment in governmental strategies and visions versus existing policies and instruments for PBD development. Second, capacity and network failures were recognized in disparities of knowledge and information flows between industry actors and knowledge institutes. Finally, technological aspects of nutritional parity of PBD products were identified as the most hampering factor in larger consumer uptake, combining system problems of capacity, presence, and quality failures."

Additionally, this study examined whether the sequence of self-explanation and retrieval practice (SE-RP vs. RP-SE) affected learning. A between-subjects design was used where 155 Dutch secondary vocational education students were randomly assigned to a RP-RP, SE-SE, RP-SE, or SE-RP condition. Participants watched an instructional video and subsequently completed a retrieval practice or self-explanation task. After completing the task, participants watched the video again and completed another retrieval practice or self-explanation task. After approximately one week, 95 participants completed a delayed posttest that measured their retention, comprehension, and transfer. Findings showed no significant effects of the use multiple generative learning strategies or sequencing of retrieval practice and self-explaining on students’ learning outcomes."

As these findings are new, little is known about the protective and the risk factors which are related to the development of complicated grief following job loss. This study aims to enrich the scientific field and contribute to the insight for covering the gap in the existing literature by exploring the relation between complicated grief following job loss (JLCG), resilience, and work-centrality. Resilience was predicted to have a negative relationship with JLCG, as it has mainly been described as a protective factor against adversity, whereas work-centrality was expected to have a positive relationship with JLCG as it refers to people with part of their identities connected to work. A third hypothesis tested the moderation role of resilience in the relation between the work-centrality and JLCG symptoms, expecting to show the effect of resilience as a protective factor to the relationship of the other two variables. The final sample consisted of 95 Greek participants. The first two hypotheses were tested with linear regression and found to be significant whereas the moderation analysis of the third hypothesis wasn’t confirmed. Current findings contribute to the effective spotting of vulnerability after a job loss and to the implications of adequate interventions and effective treatments for JLCG symptoms."

The Effects of Implementing Questions and Web Lecture Length on Mind Wandering: A Quantitative Research Study,"['Kloot Meijburg, Willemeijn van der']","['Kester, L.']",2022-09-09T00:02:14Z,EN,"['Keywords: Mind Wandering, Knowledge Clips, Implementation of Questions, Video Length']",Educational Sciences,"Abstract
The Covid-19 pandemic forced universities to work more with online lectures. Pre-recorded lectures are commonly used in a flipped classroom approach. These web lectures, also known as knowledge clips, are essential for proper understanding of the course material and participation in an in-class activity. As students watch the knowledge clips independently and without interaction with the teacher, there is a chance that the students get distracted. This process is called mind wandering. Previous research has shown that the longer the knowledge clip lasts the more mind wandering is observed. The aim of this research is to explore ways to reduce mind wandering while watching knowledge clips. Earlier research indicates that implementing retrieval quiz questions in knowledge clips may have a positive effect on reducing mind wandering. In the present study I investigate both the effect of adding retrieval questions on mind wandering and whether the degree of mind wandering is affected by the length of knowledge clips. A repeated measure two-way ANOVA 2x2 factorial design within subjects factor implementation of questions and within subjects factor video length is used. In this current study, no significant difference was found between the four different groups. However, the highest degree of mind wandering was found in the last part of the Long Afterwards group. This result is in line with previous research."

One of these changes is that people are increasingly adopting digital companions to support and optimize their daily activities. However, since users are fundamentally diverse and perceive and use digital assistants in a variety of ways, a detailed examination of the acceptance of these assistants is necessary. Based on the conceptual framework of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this thesis answers the research question of how individual characteristics influence the acceptance of digital assistants. Previous research has already examined the effects of various characteristics on the acceptance of new technologies, but has been limited to a small number of attributes. Additionally, the influence of characteristics has not yet been studied in the context of digital assistants. By conducting exploratory research, this work investigates this aspect on a wide scale. First, an extensive literature review was carried out to identify relevant characteristics, which were then used to extend the TAM model. In addition, a video was created introducing the different features of a fictitious grocery shopping digital assistant, called 'Wink'. On this basis, a survey was then conducted with 120 respondents. It was found that none of the characteristics had a significant impact on the acceptance of the digital assistant; however, perceived usefulness proved and emerged as the strongest predictor. Further analysis subsequently showed that social influence and attitude towards digital assistants had a consistent significant indirect effect on the intention to adopt the grocery shopping digital assistant. This study contributes to the literature on future research on the technology acceptance model and provides managers with a guide to enhance the performance of such technologies and to understand in more detail the adoption and user behavior."

participants were grouped into the interpersonal trauma type and 339 participants were grouped into

PTSS are found more often in those who experienced interpersonal trauma in comparison to noninterpersonal trauma. After a series of regression analyses, self-esteem was added to a mediation
model which confirmed the hypothesis that self-esteem partially mediates the relationship between
trauma type and PTSS, even more so for the interpersonal trauma type. This study highlights the
importance of self-esteem after experiencing trauma, especially for the interpersonal type,
implicating interpersonal trauma has a more detrimental effect on self-esteem than non-interpersonal
trauma. This study implicates the need for enhancing self-esteem in victims of trauma but
acknowledge further investigation on how exactly self-esteem functions in both trauma types is
needed first."

However, the question remains; “What determinant predicting the allocation of entrepreneurial talent is the most important from a cross-country level?”. This paper performs a Heckman selection model on both individual and national-level data from the GEM,WMS, WB, and Hofstede 6-cultural dimensions datasets.

An important aspect of professional development is informal learning, which is regularly used in the teaching profession. This qualitative study aims to investigate primary teachers' informal learning in the workplace and, more specifically, the deliberate part. Consequently, primary teachers from Greece were interviewed to examine the moments that impel them to participate in informal learning deliberately, their preferred informal learning activities, and the differences between novices and experienced primary school teachers regarding those engagement moments and learning activities. After analysing the data, seven engagement moments were identified, with similarities and differences between these engagement moments of novices and experienced primary school teachers and their preferred informal learning activities. These new insights could benefit teachers and school administrations in fostering the implementation of teachers' professional development and tailoring it according to their specific needs. Supplementally, this study provides a new research angle regarding primary school teachers' informal learning that could be further explored."

The question is related to an emerging market for UAM services and how different factors influence the usage of these services, including the reasons for this, how they influence each other, and the extent of the influence. The research is approached through collecting secondary data on UAM service adoption and service quality as part of an in-depth case study, where primary data is collected using interviews and analyzed with an adjusted grounded theory approach. The main findings indicate that “access” is the most important factor and “courtesy” is the least important factor, when representing their related “UAM service adoption” factors.

Our empirical findings suggested that covid-19 strengthened the negative impact of credit risk on profitability, with the most significant effect on city commercial banks and a significant effect on ROA only for joint-stock commercial banks, while it has no significant effect on state-controlled large commercial banks. We also find that covid-19 weakened the positive effect of liquidity risk on profitability, but it has a significant effect on ROA only for joint-stock commercial banks. This study provides evidence of the impact of the epidemic on commercial banks, enabling them to manage risk well and improve their risk tolerance in the post-epidemic era, as well as providing empirical evidence for future research."

Towards regional upscaling of subirrigation as a tool for agricultural climate adaptation,"['Heijmans, Tom']","['Dekker, Stefan']",2022-09-09T01:02:47Z,EN,['Agricultural Climate Adaptation;Subirrigation;Mariapeel;Vensim;System Dynamics Modelling;Regional Upscaling'],Water Science and Management,"The high Pleistocene sands in the south and east of the Netherlands have been subjected to severe drought in recent years (2018/2019). As a result, agricultural pressure on freshwater resources has increased, with negative impacts on nature as a result. As bans on surface water and groundwater abstraction are looming, it has become evident that there is a need for farmers to adapts to the fickle (political) climate.
In recent years, KWR has been implementing subirrigation (sub-surface irrigation) as an alternative and addition to conventional irrigation at the field scale under the project Klimaat Adaptatie in de Praktijk (KLIMAP). KWR has identified it as a promising tool for regional agricultural climate adaptation. From the field scale modelling and measurements, it was however evident that subirrigation requires substantial amounts of water during the growing season when the resource might be the most limited. Additionally, subirrigation has been shown to impact all components of the field scale water balance which might result in challenges for water management regionally and downstream. A fitting modelling tool to assess the effect of subirrigation when implemented on a regional scale in North-Limburg near the Mariapeel was however not yet in place.
Using Vensim PLE system dynamics modelling (SDM) software, this research aimed to set up a new base water balance model that can operate at the scale in between the current SWAP and national hydrological models (LHM). It did so by simplifying the previous water balance model SWAP for the field scale and explored expanding it to link multiple fields to the regional surface water system. Multiple scenarios for field scale parameterisation and regional implementation of subirrigation were run. This research aimed to answer the following research questions: 1) How can the hydrological processes at the field scale, and the impact of subirrigation on these processes, be translated into a simplified qualitative field scale water balance at both field and regional scale? 2) How can the influence of subirrigation on the field- & regional scale water balance be modelled quantitatively using system dynamics modelling in Vensim? And 3) How can the developed Vensim model be applied to explore scenarios for challenges/opportunities faced during the regional upscaling of subirrigation in Limburg?
The new Vensim model turned out to be capable tool, with the modelled groundwater levels closely matching those as modelled in SWAP. For the area of interest, linear extrapolation of the modelled water balance results translated into a water requirement for subirrigation of 3.3 million cubic metres of water during the growing season. This is however an overestimation, as the regional scenario modelling in this research showed the side-effect of subirrigation by increasing groundwater levels in adjacent fields. Widespread subirrigation could have detrimental effects on downstream surface water availability in times of drought and in cases of large abstractions where demand exceeds supply of surface water. Maintaining higher surface water levels might reduce subirrigation water requirements but could be difficult in times of drought.
Improvements to the model still can be made. Future research should focus on improving the field scale model representation of the unsaturated zone, improving the representation of field area in the model and on improving the parameterisation of the hydraulic conductivities within the soil. The next challenge will be to link multiple fields using the linking types as explored in this research and recreate a real-life area of interest for Waterschap Limburg to more precisely grasp water distribution challenges and requirements in case of large-scale implementation of subirrigation"
Assessing the performance of 5th Generation District Heating and Cooling Systems in European Energy Contexts,"['Bertholet, Jibbe']","['Liu, Wen']",2022-09-09T01:02:42Z,EN,['5gDHC; fifth generation district heating and cooling; HVAC alternative; performance assessment'],Energy Science,"Due to the emerging awareness of climate change and its accompanying consequences, there is an increasing need for carbon-neutral energy systems. Fifth-generation district heating and cooling system (5gDHC) is a new carbon-free technology, with high potential. However, it is still in its development phase and there is no consensus among scholars about the exact definition and performance of 5gDHC. So, in order to benefit the most from this new potential energy system, more research is needed on its performance, to see whether it can replace alternative solutions.  
This study conducts three assessments, of which all determine one or more performances of 5gDHC. First, the technical performance of four case studies is evaluated with developed key performance indicators (KPIs). Secondly, the environmental and economic performance is determined with a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and compared with a 4gDHC and a domestic gas boiler (DGB) alternative. Lastly, the social impact is assessed with a multi-criteria analysis (MCA). 
The results of the KPI analysis show that the case studies score relatively well on developed KPIs. One of the main focus points is now the use of renewable thermal energy, rather than renewable electrical energy. However, future research is needed to test the KPIs on multiple other energy systems. 
Secondly, the CBA shows that the environmental costs of 5gDHC are substantially lower than alternative solutions. However, the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of 5gDHC is much higher than the alternatives, due to a very high CAPEX. If the environmental costs and the LCOE are combined, the 5gDHC costs come closer to the alternatives but are still higher. 
Lastly, the MCA shows that the social impact of a 5gDHC is significantly lower than the alternative solutions. However, future quantitative research on this impact could help give a more complete answer.  
To conclude, the 5gDHC shows some real potential for the (near) future. Compared with alternatives it scores well on the environmental and social impact. However, from an economic point of view, the 5gDHC is currently substantially more expensive than alternatives. This makes the technology probably, without subsidies or funding, not an economically viable solution. However, 5gDHC is a new technology and costs potentially can decrease tremendously with the learning and experience curve. Furthermore, considering the rapid demand for renewable solutions for heating and cooling systems, because of climate change and the rising gas prices, 5gDHC has a large potential for being one of those solutions."
"Renewed cities, renewed appreciation? Investigating the appreciation of the urban renewal building style in Dutch cities.","['Veenhof, Rienje']","['Smit, Martijn']",2022-09-09T01:02:56Z,EN,['Urban renewal;hedonic price modeling;photodocumentation;photo documentation;building style;appreciation;housing price;housing;housing prices;cluster analysis;architecture'],Human Geography,"This thesis investigates the effect of the Dutch urban renewal building style (1975 – 1985) on housing 
prices in Amsterdam, Utrecht and Leiden. Although urban renewal is generally seen as a relatively 
‘unattractive’ building style, it is not yet known to what extent this influences transaction prices. 
Furthermore, the unique spatial lay-out of urban renewal provides the opportunity to gain insight into 
the price effect of the neighbors’ building style on houses as well. Because it is challenging to separate 
the effects of a building style from other structural and locational characteristics of a house, this study 
uses a rich data set of housing transactions supplemented with locational variables. The employed 
methods, hedonic price modelling, cluster analysis and photo documentation, make it possible to 
untwine the effects of the building style from the other characteristics. The results show that urban 
renewal creates a small but significant price discount (-3.9%) in comparison to the reference period 
(1900 – 1951). Furthermore, significant price premiums (+4.9% to +6.1%) are found for urban renewal 
houses that are surrounded by pre-war buildings, compared to houses located in clusters of urban 
renewal. However, the explanatory power of the building style is limited compared to other locational 
and structural factors. Photo documentation of case studies uncovered unconventional and subjective 
aspects of housing appreciation that could influence prices, namely a desirable streetscape and 
neighborhood image. This study contributes to the broader field of housing studies by providing 
empirical support for price effects attributable to a specific and ‘undesirable’ building style. 
Additionally, it demonstrates that the spatial configuration of housing can have an effect on prices as 
well. Furthermore, it submits the use of mixed methods in housing price studies to achieve a deeper 
and more holistic understanding of ‘appreciation’ of housing, for instance through the use of a broader 
range of variables and through the inclusion of subjective and ‘soft’ housing factors."
The Impact of Heat Load on the Business Case of MT DH Systems,"['Rossum, Willem van']","['Liu, Wen']",2022-09-09T01:02:45Z,EN,['District Heating; Business Case; Competing sustainable strategies;'],Energy Science,"To evolve into a carbon-free society, the built environment needs to move to sustainable, natural gasfree heating by 2030. The PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL) has defined five 
strategies for sustainable heating. One of these strategies is to switch to medium-temperature district 
heating (MT DH) systems to heat buildings. Because DH systems take a long time to develop, there are 
uncertainties associated with the amount of heat that will be sold. The unknown influence of
competing sustainable heat strategies, make these uncertainties bigger. This leads to the following 
research question:
‘How does a change in heat load for DH systems due to competing heat strategies influence the 
business case of new MT DH systems for DH companies in the Netherlands?’
To answer this research question, an area in Delft, consisting of six neighbourhoods was chosen to 
analyse. For this area, using the business case template developed by TNO and commissioned by the 
ECW (expertise centrum warmte), the business case for the DH system was calculated under positive 
assumptions and energy demands. The resulting business case in the subject neighbourhood was 
positive. Next, scenarios were developed based on competing sustainability strategies, to evaluate the 
effect these strategies and behaviour have on the business case. These strategies were competing 
sustainable heating technologies and shell-improvements. Competing sustainable heating 
technologies affect the participation rate of the DH system, while shell-improvements affect the heat 
demand per connection. From this, five scenarios arose (excluding the reference scenario). Each 
scenario had a different combination of participation rates and insulation. The effect of these scenarios 
was evaluated from the national cost perspective and from the DH company perspective.
The results showed that the business case is strongly affected by the DH system heat load. When 
assumptions about participation rate and insulation levels worsened, the projected NPV and IRR
declined. In every scenario, the IRR is positive and the investments are recuperated. However, only the 
reference scenario and the two least negative scenarios resulted in a positive business case. Higher 
insulation levels alone did not result in a negative business case for the DH company, but does strongly 
influences the national costs per avoided CO2. An uncertainty analysis showed that the price for which 
heat is purchased and sold are the two most influential parameters for the business case. From this 
thesis, it can be concluded that competing sustainable heating strategies have a significant influence 
on the heat load and the business case of DH systems. There are scenarios where a DH system is still 
the strategy with the lowest national cost but is not a good investment for DH companies. Further 
research must point out whether or not it is efficient for the government to subsidise DH systems in 
these cases"
Detecting Musical Rhetoric Figures with LSTM using Procedurally Generated Synthetic Data,"['Gier, Niek de']","['Kranenburg, P. van']",2022-09-09T01:03:06Z,EN,['LSTM; Synthetic Data; Figuren; Bach;'],Artificial Intelligence,"Musicologists have researched rhetorical techniques applied to baroque music, which includes the works of Johann Sebastian Bach. These musical rhetoric figures come in the
form of rhythmic and melodic patterns, with each figure having the goal of evoking a certain emotion or Christian symbolism. This thesis presents a machine learning approach to
pattern recognition in symbolic music. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model will
be trained to detect the figura corta, a rhythmical figure, in the cantatas of J.S. Bach.
Since a labeled dataset of Bach’s cantatas does not exist and labeling the data manually
would be extremely time consuming, this thesis approaches the problem by generating a
dataset from scratch. By drawing up laws and rules to which the data should abide, an
algorithm is presented that generates plausible musical fragments as training input based
on these criteria. Then, twelve different parameter settings were explored by training an
LSTM on the resulting datasets. The best performing model was subsequently tested
on six real cantata movements. On average, the LSTM model achieved a precision of
78.53%, a recall of 83.12% and an accuracy of 94.46%. From these results it is concluded
that synthetic data can produce a reliable dataset to train an LSTM that can successfully
classify real data on whether it contains a figura corta or not. Furthermore, this result
implies that the presented method of procedurally generating data produces a varied and
correct dataset. By extension, it implies that the laws and rules proposed, as well as the
representation of the musical data, allow the LSTM to correctly apply its learned features
to real data."
Creation of a runnability index with temporal influences,"['Heinsbroek, Ruben']","['Scheider, Simon']",2022-09-09T01:03:03Z,EN,['Runnability; QGIS'],Applied Data Science,"This research focuses on the effect of precipitation on running behaviour of people in the city

that influence running behaviour. These different features are used to create a benchmark
runnability index, which is then extended with a variable depicting influences on running
behaviour depending on the precipitation level. By analysing running routes scraped from
Endomodo, the differences between dry, moderate precipitation and heavy precipitation runs
were found, which were used to quantify the influences of the environment given the
precipitation level. With these new models, the runnability scores at road level and
neighbourhood level were determined, which showed that there exist some hotspots in Utrecht
for running. Furthermore, with a correlation analysis between the different runnability indices
and running data, it was found that the extended runnability indices described the running
behaviour for different precipitation levels better, which shows that including weather in the
runnability index is useful. Further research should be focused on getting more running data to
analyse the differences and similarities between runs with different precipitation levels. With
this knowledge, the runnability index could then be improved even further."

with a focus on the collaboration of the donor on the one side and the “ones to be helped” on
the other (Di Ciommo, 2014). Among the development actors, such as NGOs, governments,
and development banks, a quite new group came up, namely the private development initiatives
(“ PDIs”)- which are small scale organisations that differ from the other groups mainly due to
their small scale and local projects. Their focus, as claimed by several authors (e.g. Hellheiner,
2010; Kinsbergen, 2014; Van den Berg & De Goede, 2012; Shirch, 2019; Van der Lee, 2011),
is concerned with local ownership and local sustainable development. Local ownership implies
that the local community at focus does actively participate in the whole project planning,
execution, and maintenance (=keeping it “running”). Four interrelated principles are key for
local ownership, which are local participation, self-reliance, empowerment, and capacity
building. It has been argued that this local ownership with an eye at development for a
particular community at the long term, called in the thesis “local sustainable development”, is
often a key part to integrate in the methods of PDIs (e.g. Jourdan, 1998; Hellheiner, 2010;
Ejdus, 2017; Eijndhoven-Meijers, 2021; De Gaay-Fortman, 2021). There has been done
research on the topic by scholars such as Kinsbergen (2014;2015), Ejdus (2017), Schulpen
(2005), and Schirch (2019). However, there has not research research yet how local ownership
is integrated by the PDIs specifically in their methods of small- scale local poverty reduction
in the Global South. Therefore, the research in this thesis will focus on the main question: How
is local ownership, with an eye on local sustainable development in the Global South, integrated
in the methods of PDIs? By conducting in depth interviews with people that have had PDIs and
with people that have a background in the topic, and by analyzing among other things policy
documents of PDIs (secondary data collection), an answer is provided. Furthermore, a special
focus is put on four specific PDIs in Mali and postcolonialism as perspective on the methods of
the PDIs. Looking at the results, it can be concluded that local ownership is a key part of the
method of PDIs and that the principles of community participation, self-reliance,
empowerment, and capacity building are significant: letting the locals actively participate,
relying on their own resources, strengthening their skills and capacities and/or empowering
their mentality are key for the local development projects- and show lots of postcolonial
characteristics."
Inclusive Business Models in Ethiopia: The Impact of Value Chain Inclusion on Smallholder Farmers’ Use of Land and Irrigation,"['Hillenbrand, Kim']","['Westen, Guus van']",2022-09-09T02:00:29Z,EN,['inclusive business; value chain integration; smallholder farmers; Ethiopia; natural resource use; rural development'],International Development Studies,"Numerous studies have found that resource-poor farmers are often bypassed in inclusive business approaches, leading to worsened food security and exacerbated inequalities. However, the studies analysing the impact pathways of smallholder value chain inclusion have predominantly focused on outcomes in terms of income, productivity, or consumption effects. The impact on productive resources has received considerably less attention, yet the households’ access to productive resources indicates long-term effects and holds a central role in food security and welfare. Therefore, an analysis from a resource-based view is required, as smallholder farmers in Ethiopia are highly dependent on land and water resources, in an environment that experiences increasing resource stress. The sustainable livelihood framework underpins the role of natural resources as critical assets that determine the farmers’ livelihood strategies.

Although previous research has examined smallholder value chain inclusion, results have remained mixed and dispersed. Therefore, this study presents a systematic literature review that synthesises the patterns in Ethiopian smallholder farmers’ land and irrigation use after value chain integration. Web of Science, Scopus, and Taylor & Francis databases were systematically reviewed for relevant academic literature, overarching concepts and themes were developed across the final set of articles (n=33) and subsequently explored in expert interviews (n=3).

The analysis identified positive effects of participation on input access, income and productivity gains, contrasted with adverse consequences of input dependence, intensified land and irrigation demand, crowding out, and monocropping practices. Most studies confirmed land size and access to irrigation as inclusion requirements, while few found a lack of effect. Better resource endowment facilitated inclusion and inclusion led to better access to and accumulation of productive resources. The higher resource demand of IB activities poses additional strains on the natural resources, potentially enhancing conflict and competition among the smallholders."

However, the limits of urban sprawl are being reached, and instead, it is becoming denser and denser in cities. With urban densification, cities focus on sustainable urban development. Urban densification forces policymakers to use space in a sustainable way, but what does this mean for social sustainability? In the scientific debate on the relationship between urban densification and social sustainability, it is emphasized that this relationship is strongly context-dependent. This thesis presents the context of the Merwedekanaalzone in Utrecht regarding the relationship between urban densification and social sustainability. Like many other cities, the Dutch city of Utrecht is focusing on urban densification in order to meet the housing demand with the increasingly scarce space. The Merwedekanaalzone is one of the areas being densified, where 10,000 homes are being built with unprecedented density by European standards. The project demonstrates sustainability in mobility and the environment, but what about the social sustainability of the developments in the Merwedekanaalzone? Building on existing literature, this research shows through surveys and additional interviews with stakeholders that diverse housing is crucial for optimal social sustainability in the Merwedekanaalzone. Besides explaining the main challenges for achieving social sustainability through urban densification, suggestions for possible follow-up research are mentioned in this thesis."

A temperature and thermodynamic entropy is then associated to both. Regarding both universes as quantum systems, we can also consider the von Neumann entropy of their subregions. A side-by-side comparison between these spacetimes is made on their thermodynamic properties, quantum entropy and the application of replica wormholes to the von Neumann entropy of their radiation. For the black hole it is known a classical replica derivation of its von Neumann entropy results in exactly its thermodynamic entropy. We use the same method for the static patch in de Sitter spacetime and also find its thermodynamic entropy. Recently it was shown a semi-classical replica method can reproduce the island formula for radiation from an eternal black hole by including replica wormholes. Again, we apply the same calculation to de Sitter spacetime in the Bunch-Davies vacuum and recover the island formula."

However, the DGMR model often failed to correctly classify predictions at long lead times. Therefore, it was concluded that this model is capable of making predictions for the Netherlands. However, re-training of the model is required to achieve the full capabilities of the model."
"Gebouwen voor vrouwen, De wensen en huisvesting van alleenstaande werkende vrouwen gebouwd tussen 1940-1965","['Leijnse, Veerle']","['Roell, Eva']",2022-09-09T02:03:10Z,NL,['wederopbouw; vrouwen; vrouwenhuisvesting; Oranjehof; Paviljoenshof; Parkflat Theobroma; Raadshof; RVS Flat; Corverbos; Elisabeth Brugsmaflat; Oudenoord; Jan Evertsenstraat; Koningsbos; Louise Wenthuis; Klokkenhof'],Kunstgeschiedenis,"Dit onderzoek gaat in op de woonwensen van alleenstaande, werkende vrouwen en de huisvesting die daar voor werd gerealiseerd tussen 1940 en 1965. In de wederopbouwperiode (1940-1965) werd een aantal opvallende bouwprojecten gerealiseerd: Woongelegenheden die speciaal gebouwd waren om alleenstaande, werkende vrouwen te huisvesten. Ongehuwde vrouwen die door te werken zichzelf financieel konden onderhouden waren in het midden van de twintigste eeuw een uitzondering. De zelfstandigheid van de vrouw werd beperkt zodra zij op zoek ging naar een woonruimte buiten het ouderlijk huis. Woonopties voor alleenstaanden, vrouwen én mannen, waren beperkt tot inwonen bij een hospita of pension. Diverse vrouwenorganisaties vonden dat voor vrouwen een onwenselijke situatie omdat zij vonden dat een vrouw recht had op privacy en een eigen thuis nodig had waar zij zichzelf kon zijn. Er werden tussen 1953 en 1956 woonwensonderzoeken uitgezet door vrouwenorganisaties om inzicht te krijgen hoe de alleenstaande vrouw woonde en hoe zij zou willen wonen. Hieruit kwam naar voren dat alleenstaande, werkende vrouwen een huurwoning in een flat waar zowel mannen als vrouwen konden wonen prefereerden. De voorkeurslocatie van de huisvesting was net buiten het stadscentrum. De eigen woning zou idealiter bestaan uit twee kamers, een zitkamer en aparte slaapkamer. Een eigen keuken en sanitaire voorzieningen waren zo goed als een vereiste. De opgave om dit te realiseren bleek moeilijk te zijn omdat er geen subsidie voor dergelijke bouwprojecten werd gegeven. De vrouwenorganisaties oefenden hun invloed uit via lezingen, publicaties en door zich in de lokale politiek kenbaar te maken om zoveel mogelijk aandacht te vragen voor de huisvestingsproblemen.				In dit onderzoek zijn twaalf bouwprojecten die gerealiseerd zijn tussen 1940 en 1965 onderzocht waar alleenstaande vrouwen konden wonen. Dit zijn Oranjehof in Amsterdam, Paviljoenshof in Leiden, Parkflat Theobroma in Hilversum, Raadshof in Hilversum, RVS Flat in Rotterdam, Corverbos in Hilversum, Elisabeth Brugsmaflat in Den Haag, Oudenoord 501-621 in Utrecht, Jan Evertsenstraat 201-471 in Amsterdam, Koningsbos in Bussum, Louise Wenthuis in Amsterdam en Klokkenhof, Amsterdam. Aan de hand van casusonderzoeken zijn deze complexen en woningen daarin beschreven, waarna de kenmerken in een tabel zijn opgenomen om de verschillen en overeenkomsten inzichtelijk te maken. Tevens is aan de hand van de resultaten uit de woonwensonderzoeken getoetst of de woningen voldeden aan de woonwensen van vrouwen. Er kan geconcludeerd worden uit het onderzoek dat de woningen die in de wederopbouwperiode voor alleenstaande vrouwen gebouwd zijn grotendeels voldoen aan de gestelde wensen. Er is echter geen woningcomplex gevonden dat aan alle eisen voldeed. Met de woningen die gerealiseerd zijn is wel voldaan aan het realiseren van een eigen thuis voor de alleenstaande vrouw."
The Influence of a Cultural Filter on the Netflix Series Emily in Paris: A Cross-Cultural Comparison of the English and French Translations,"['Kachramanian, Carina']","['Kremers-Ammouche, Michele']",2022-09-09T02:03:16Z,EN,['cultural filter; Emily in Paris; Netflix; translation; House; directness; indirectness; ad-hoc formulations; verbal routines; code-switching in media'],Interculturele communicatie,"The prominent streaming service Netflix has millions of members across the world and offers a wide range of movies and series in different languages. The platform is now utilized for more than simply entertainment; it is also used by many to learn foreign languages. Hence, the question of whether translation achieves international inclusiveness or is tailored to the culture of a particular country arises. This study focuses on the translation of the Netflix Original series Emily in Paris. The original English version, as well as the French dubbed and subtitled versions, were examined using a qualitative method to determine how much of a difference the culture filter makes. Furthermore, this study investigates the effect of the Netflix Timed Text Style Guides on the use of cultural filters in the French subtitled version, as well as the code-switching throughout the series.

This study found that the French synchronization of the Netflix Original series Emily in Paris applied cultural filters in terms of directness and ad-hoc formulations; the French translations were made more direct and had more ad-hoc formulations than the original English version. The series’ French subtitled version furthermore adhered to the Netflix Timed Text Style Guides, making this version appear more straightforward in comparison to the others.

Code-switching is another factor that might cause the series’ French subtitled version to diverge from the original English and French dubbed versions. Code-switching occurred often in both the original English and French dubbed versions of the series. Aside from greetings, catch phrases, expressions of affection, and adjectives and adverbs, numerous random words were used on a regular basis. Finally, there were two more factors that impacted how the French translations of the series came across, which were storyline discrepancies across versions and gaps in the translation of the subtitled version. The French dubbed version followed a different plot from the original English and French dubbed versions, and the French subtitled version did not always subtitle language that was entirely in French in both the original English and French dubbed versions. All of these factors might lead to viewers of the French versions of the series having a different viewpoint on the series than viewers of the original English version."
Migrant Food Entrepreneurs and Gentrification in Lombok,"['Huss, Sacha']","['Brouwer, Sara']",2022-09-09T02:03:20Z,EN,[],International Development Studies,"In this research, I investigate the relations at play between migrant entrepreneurship and
gentrification in the neighbourhood of Lombok in Utrecht. A specific focus is set on food
entrepreneurs due to the socio-cultural relevance food has for immigrant communities.
Gentrification and its effects on the population of a neighbourhood and on the existing
businesses established there have been extensively studied. The worldwide phenomenon has
received much attention, both in media and academia. Gentrification is commonly seen as
achieving consistently negative outcomes for local residents and businesses. However, previous
research on the subject suggests that the relationship between gentrification and migrant
entrepreneurs is more complex. It cannot only be thought of as defined by retail gentrification.
In many cities, migrant entrepreneurs are concentrated in areas with high immigrant
populations. Their socio-cultural importance confers them with an invaluable role in the
inclusion of immigrants in these cities. However, the appeal of culturally diverse
neighbourhoods can often be a factor in gentrification. The case study of Lombok is a
neighbourhood containing a large immigrant population and numerous migrant-owned
businesses and is currently experiencing gentrification. A series of in-depth interviews with
migrant food entrepreneurs were conducted during the process of this research. I employ the
notion of “the right to the city” to explore and understand how migrant food entrepreneurs in
Lombok contest the process of gentrification. Moreover, I use the concept of “mixed
embeddedness” to grasp how migrant food entrepreneurs are affected by the changes caused by
gentrification and how they adapt to them. The research findings indicate that migrant food
entrepreneurship in Utrecht is changing. Some shops are facing closure. On the other hand,
some migrant food entrepreneurs adapt to the neighbourhood's changing demographics, and
some even become agents of gentrification."
Life in the empty diagonal: the experiences and impacts of newcomers in rural France,"['Coutin, Megan']","['Zoomers, Annelies']",2022-09-09T02:03:12Z,EN,['newcomer; rural shrinkage; emplacement; resettlement; revitalisation'],International Development Studies,"Two phenomena are occurring in parallel across France – the influx and subsequent resettlement of refugees and asylum seekers, and the gradual depopulation of rural areas. The intersection of these trends is found with the resettlement that is increasingly taking place in remote areas of the country that are encountering the challenges of rural shrinkage. This research aimed to assess what role these areas can play in providing a welcome space for newcomers despite the challenges associated with living in rural regions, as well as identifying the potential for livelihood improvement. Using a case study approach, this research took place in Aubusson and Felletin, two shrinking rural towns in France currently open to receiving newcomers in the context of increasing efforts to disperse refugees and asylum seekers across the country. Employing the concept of emplacement as an alternative lens to integration redirects attention away overarching distinctions between French locals and foreign newcomers and places the emphasis on facilitating local-level relations. The supposed divide between natives and newcomers is found to be more overlapping than initially anticipated. Ultimately, the study finds that a successful placement with mutual benefit for the community and new arrivals would be one in which there remains opportunities for work, functional essential services and facilities within a reasonable distance, and prospects of meaningful social interactions. Livelihood improvement in this context is feasible, and there are instances of highly successful initiatives that contribute to local revitalisation, but these are not guaranteed. Expecting newcomers to shoulder the burden for revitalisation and singlehandedly alter a town’s development trajectory would be both unfair and unrealistic."

Investigation of the potential for PV energy supply to reach net energy neutrality in the railway infrastructure by 2030,"['Bouw, Niek']","['Crijns-Graus, Wina']",2022-09-09T03:01:55Z,EN,[],Energy Science,"As of today, more organisations act on their Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER) and 
acknowledge their contributions to environmental impacts. ProRail, responsible for the Dutch railway 
network, is one of these organisations and set clear sustainability goals as a result. One of these goals 
is to reach energy neutrality in 2030. To reach this goal, renewable energy on ProRail assets is 
needed to ensure the energy demand is met annually. As a result, this study investigated the 
potential of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy and the implementation within the ProRail infrastructure 
to contribute to this goal. 

The perspective of the 2030 energy demand of ProRail was investigated with scenario creation. Two 
frozen technology scenarios were created which showed increases in the energy demand due to the 
expected rise in train passengers. In addition, an energy efficiency scenario was constructed that
contained proposed energy efficiency improvements that significantly contribute to a 22% reduction 
in energy consumption. Despite this demand reduction, the analysed energy efficiency measures 
were not sufficient to reach a 30% reduction in the energy demand compared to 2015 levels. ProRail 
pursued this goal from 2015 onwards with yearly 2% energy efficiency improvements. As a result of 
this finding, additional energy efficiency improvements need to be explored and implemented. 

Furthermore, the technical and techno-economic potential for solar photovoltaic technology 
installations on ProRail assets was analysed. This analysis was performed through ArcGIS software. 
The technical analysis showed limited potential for the roofs of buildings and platforms, as it could 
only provide 26% of the energy consumption of ProRail in the most favourable energy efficiency 
demand scenario. On the other hand, the open fields owned by ProRail have a technical potential to cover 100% of the energy demand and facilitate additional energy for other consumption sources 
such as trains. However, it was also found that the uncertainty of this finding indicates that detailed 
further research is necessary to retrieve results with higher accuracy. The techno-economic potential 
showed that 37% of the PV installations had a positive NPV value. Despite this relatively low 
percentage, the overall positive Net Present Value (NPV) for all the investigated PV installation 
locations of the rooftops was positive. This indicates that 37% of the surfaces with positive NPVs 
outweigh the negative values and relatively high financial attractivity is reached. The range of 
Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) values found for all the PV locations is quite comparable with the 
general outlook of the LCOE of solar PV in 2030. In addition, the LCOE range was cheaper than all 
fossil-fuel technologies indicating financial attractiveness and competitiveness. 

A SWOT analysis was performed and found that the implementation of PV is troubled by the 
electricity network administrator role of ProRail, as they are unable to generate electricity for other 
organisations that use the overhead electricity line of the railway network. The availability of 
subsidies and research projects could be used effectively to investigate new opportunities for PV 
implementation. Furthermore, an increased number of trains will contain an electricity meter on 
board. As a result, railway transport operators like NS measure their electricity use and could enter 
their own individual contracts. ProRail, responsible for the railway infrastructure and overhead 
electricity lines, is left with the energy losses in the cables that is not included in the energy contracts 
and administrated as ProRail energy use. Consequently, the energy demand almost doubles in 2030. 
This indicates that a fast implementation process of PV is required and energy efficiency improvements are crucial"
The Relationship between Raising Metacognitive Awareness and English Reading Comprehension of Dutch Grade 11 Pre-University Students,"['Noord, Sophie de']","['Hagar, Trenton']",2022-09-09T03:01:58Z,EN,['Metacognitive awareness; English reading comprehension; reading strategies; ESL; self-evaluation instrument; MARSI'],Engelse taal en cultuur: educatie en communicatie,"Academic research and curricular reforms are interested in the relationship between metacognitive awareness and English reading comprehension. More advanced readers can monitor their approach and switch between strategies to overcome reading comprehension challenges. This study aimed to investigate the association between raising metacognitive awareness in 15 Dutch grade 11 pre-university students with a control group of 17 students. It was investigated in the Dutch school system because the Netherlands has the greatest level of English proficiency out of 112 nations. Therefore, this study examined whether a higher proficiency translated to a significant relationship between their level of metacognitive awareness based on the MARSI-R and their performances on mini English reading comprehension tests before and after the intervention. Results demonstrated that for the small number of students metacognitive awareness increased in a positive and marginally statistically significant way. However, there was no correlation between this improvement and the quantity of exposure each student received from attending lessons and working with a self-evaluation instrument. Students’ English reading comprehension did not statistically improve either, even though most of the six students present during both intervention test sessions saw an improvement in their individual results. Raising their metacognitive awareness was not statistically significantly related to their English reading comprehension. However, there are a number of limitations in the procedure, particularly the data collection and missing cases in the dataset, which necessitate further study because the results of the current study do not accurately reflect the results of a sizable sample of students."
Mission-oriented Innovation System (MIS) analysis on transition towards circular personal protective equipment in Dutch academic hospitals,"['Bijlmer, Hidde']","['Moors, Ellen']",2022-09-09T03:01:47Z,EN,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The Covid-19 pandemic has put a lot of pressure on the healthcare sector. In addition, the pandemic shed light on the enormous amount of waste production caused by the single-use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in hospitals. PPE is equipment that is used to prevent or minimize the healthcare worker and patient exposure to hazards and includes gloves, face masks, goggles, face shields and gowns. The extensive use of disposable PPE has led to a worldwide production of 8 million tons of plastic waste, with more than 25.000 tons ending up in the oceans. The transition from these disposable PPE to the use of circular alternatives would save tons of plastic waste production and significantly reduce the environmental impact. This transition would contribute to the circular mission of the Green Deal Duurzame Zorg 2.0 in the Netherlands. The mission-oriented innovation system (MIS) approach is an adequate approach to analyse the innovation system related to this mission, as this approach enables the analysis of the development and diffusion of multiple circular PPE innovations.

The MIS approach has been used to answer the following research question: “What are the barriers for a transition from disposable personal protective equipment towards circular alternatives in Dutch academic hospitals”. In addition, the research will provide policy recommendations to overcome the identified barriers to the transition. The research question is examined according to five analytical steps of the MIS approach: problem-solution diagnosis, structural analysis, functional system analysis, systemic barrier analysis, and the identification of systemic instruments. These analytical steps allow the mapping of the circular PPE alternatives, the network of stakeholders and institutions, system strengths, system barriers and useful policy instruments.

The problem-solution diagnosis showed that there already are circular PPE alternatives available in the market. However, the alternatives are not yet implemented on a large scale in the Dutch academic hospitals. Based on the data analysis, four systemic barriers were identified. These include the strict infection prevention guidelines within hospitals, the lack of knowledge proving the environmental advantage of the circular PPE alternatives, the lack of stimulating financial institutions and regulations that incentivise the development and adoption of the circular PPE alternatives, and a lock-in of healthcare workers to using disposables. Currently, there are little to no governance actions and policy instruments in place in the Netherlands that effectively stimulate the transition to circular PPE alternatives within Dutch academic hospitals. In the final step of the MIS, several policy instruments and specific intervention strategies are presented to overcome the identified systemic barriers. The most important policy instruments include the provision of government funding for hospitals to cover the extra costs of the transition towards circular PPE alternatives and financially stimulating PPE manufacturers to develop these alternatives through pricing, standardising and subsidising. By implementing the recommended policy instruments and intervention strategies the circular PPE alternatives are able to develop and diffuse more efficiently which contributes to the circular mission of the Green Deal Duurzame Zorg 2.0."

critical juncture die leidde tot de aanname van de Wet afbreking zwangerschap. Hiervoor zijn
zeven debatten geanalyseerd die tussen 1971 en 1980 plaatsvonden. Het betreft drie
regeringsverklaringen en vier debatten waarin abortus provocatus stond. In deze debatten is
gekeken hoe sprekers van de verschillende partijen abortus duiden, of framen. Dit is gedaan
met behulp van definities van Benford en Snow (2000) en De Bruijn (2019). Het beeld van
de botsende frames dat hieruit ontstaan is, wordt in dit onderzoek geplaatst in een de
context van de critical juncture theory, een model dat verklaart hoe een grote verandering in
beleid tot stand kan komen. Dit onderzoek deconstrueert zo een zeer omstreden
beleidsproces. De casus die in dit onderzoek centraal staat, is door zijn geladenheid een
most-likely case om deze frames waar te nemen.
Ten tijde van de casus waren er in de Nederlandse politiek drie hoofdstromingen
waar te nemen: liberalisme, confessionalisme en socialisme. In de zeven onderzochte
debatten waren twee soorten frames dominant. Dit betrof allereerst diagnostic frames, die
duiden waar een probleem volgens de spreker vandaan komt. Hierbinnen botst het
diagnostic frame van ‘leven vanaf conceptie’ (confessioneel) met het frame dat abortus
vereenzelvigt is met de autonomie van de vrouw (liberaal en socialistisch). Dit laatste frame
wordt door de casus heen steeds dominanter. Daarnaast is er een botsing te zien tussen
prognostic frames, die een oplossing aandragen. Enerzijds is te zien dat confessionele
partijen, vertrekkend vanuit hun diagnostic frame van leven vanaf conceptie, abortus
afwijzen, anderzijds is te zien dat de socialisten abortus uit het wetboek van strafrecht willen
halen. De liberalen gebruiken het prognostic frame dat het een privékwestie is van het
individu, waar de overheid zich niet inhoudelijk in moet uitspreken. Motivational frames, de
derde frame soort die Benford en Snow (2000) onderscheiden, kwamen nagenoeg niet voor.
Naarmate de casus zich ontwikkelt, is te zien dat niet de partijen die verandering nastreven,
maar juist de partijen die de status quo aanhangen zich meer gaan bedienen van
counterframing en deframing.
Dit onderzoek sluit aan op een maatschappelijke discussie die nog altijd actueel is en
die bij tijd en wijle oplaait. De frames die waargenomen zijn in dit onderzoek zijn ook de
frames die nu gebruikt worden als het over abortus provocatus gaat. In een bredere zin sluit
het onderzoek aan bij het analyseren en onderzoeken van totstandkoming van beleid in
Nederland in het algemeen."

Research questions concerned the attitudes of students and teachers towards Dutch as the language of instruction and the current use of the different languages (Papiamento, English, Dutch, Spanish) in secondary education. Aruban students (n=272) and teachers (n=36) of five different secondary schools participated in a questionnaire. A sub group of students (n=22) and teachers (n=12) were approached for a semi-structured interview. Classroom observations were conducted to determine the actuality of the language situation in secondary schools. The results of this study reveal that Papiamento is the first language for the majority of the participants. As a result, students are constantly faced with challenges with the Dutch language in school. Furthermore, teachers find it increasingly difficult to teach in only Dutch. Teachers often use other languages such as Papiamento and English in their lessons in order to aid the students’ understanding of the material. Both students and teachers acknowledge the importance of Dutch in the Aruban education but believe that bi-multilingual education would be of greater benefit to the students. Students prefer to communicate in Papiamento and English and teachers are willing and open to explore and adapt their teaching pedagogies to better cater to their multilingual classroom."

whether autonomous motivation moderates between setting specific goals and goal pursuit. A 
pilot study was conducted to determine the assigned goal, so that in goal difficulty it would 
match a self-set goal. A repeated measures design was used in the main study with a one week 
interval. In the first measurement, participants had to indicate their meat consumption and 
autonomous motivation to reduce meat consumption and were assigned to one of three 
experimental conditions: no-goal, self-set goal or assigned goal. In the second measurement, 
meat consumption was measured again and also goal difficulty, goal pursuit and exploratory 
variables. No significant difference was found between the effectiveness of specific goals and 
non-specific goals. There was also no support found for a moderating role of autonomous 
motivation between setting specific goals and goal pursuit. Self-set goals and assigned goals 
appeared equally effective. This suggests that campaigns using assigned goals can be effective 
in reducing meat consumption. Future research could investigate whether this is evenly 
effective when the assigned goal is less difficult or more difficult than when people set their 
goals themselves. Attention also may be paid to the effect of placing more focus on achieving

Potential effects of chemo-mechanical interaction with calcite bearing faults on modeled induced slip during CO2 storage in sandstone aquifers,"['Looij, Koen van der']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-09-09T03:03:32Z,EN,['CO2; rupture; fault weakening; friction; cohesion; modelling;'],Earth Structure and Dynamics,"CO2 storage in aquifers has the potential of storage capacities of up to 1.5 Gt in the Netherlands. In geomechanical modelling of the risk of seismicity upon CO2 injection in aquifers, currently the potential of chemical weakening of faults is often not taken in account. Laboratory experiments or observations form natural analogues of CO2 injection however suggest that the dissolution of CO2, which causes a lowering of the pH, can result in the dissolution of calcite which can cause weakening of fault strength or frictional strength. In this study, the effect on seismicity of chemically weakening static friction, dynamic friction, or cohesion of calcite or calcite bearing fault gouge in the presence of dissolved CO2 is tested. To test these effects, three existing codes are coupled to simulate CO2 flow, stress changes and corresponding fault rupture. Injection and flow through the sandstone reservoir is modelled using flow simulator TOUGH-ECO2M, from which the spatiotemporal relationships of temperature, pressure and CO2 saturation are taken. Corresponding stress changes are calculated from poro-elastic and thermo-elastic equations using inhouse software SRIMA (Seal and Reservoir Integrity Mechanical Analysis). The stress changes are then projected on a fault surface with predefined roughness using BSQuakeSim (Block-Spring earthQuake catalogues Simulator), which is a rupture model for induced seismicity following stress changes. CO2 concentration is coupled in several simulations to the value of either static friction, dynamic friction or cohesion following simple linear relations to individually test the influence of CO2 on the rupture timing, magnitude and frequency. This study found that poro-elastic stress changes, thermos-elastic stress changes and chemical weakening from CO2 saturation variation individually contribute to destabilisation of a fault following different spatio-temporal relations. Chemical weakening mainly lowers the required thermo-elastic stress change to reach criticality but can also act as the triggering mechanism. Pressure changes and CO2- calcite interaction affect the fault stability over a longer spatial extent than temperature changes. In the current simulation setup, faults are largely chemically weakened prior to the arrival of a cold front at the fault surface. It is found that lowering the static friction leads to earlier rupture events, a higher total number of rupture events but not necessarily of higher moment magnitude. Lowering the static friction increases the stress drop and thus stress release upon rupture. Therefore, rupture events of higher moment magnitude are found. Chemically lowering cohesion values leads to earlier rupture events, and a larger area of the fault surface along which slip occurs. Localized weakening of parts of a fault surface could affect the stability of the whole fault. In should be noted that to visualise changes in seismicity, initial criticality was required, therefore some unfavourable assumptions were made regarding injection rate and injection temperature. Also, the reactivity of calcite with the dissolved CO2 is most likely overestimated in this study. However, under certain site-specific reservoir and injection conditions, localized fault strength weakening following CO2 injection can contribute to the triggering of rupture events and magnitude of events and should therefore be taken in account in future seismic risk assessments of CCS projects in aquifers."

As a simulation game based on capitalist logic, The Sims 4 can be used as a tool to challenge built-in assumptions of capitalism. By employing a diachronic proceduralist method, and by using Donella Meadows’ insights on systems theory, Amitav Ghosh’ postcolonial insight, Matt Huber’s class critique, and George Lakoff’s understanding of framing, this thesis explores how The Sims 4, with emphasis on the The Sims 4: Eco Lifestyle expansion, connects to current popular debates surrounding sustainability (e.g. the ecological footprint, clean energy, and dumpster diving). Then, by having collected 187 mods and by understanding modding as a form of metagaming, this thesis looks into dominant patterns of ecocritical mod creation (‘ecomodding’). Modding games is an active creative way for fans to engage with the source material, allowing them to participate by criticising and nuancing the discourses of sustainability this game connects to. Finally, through employing an auto-ethnographic method, the author created two new ecomods to explore ecomodding as a valuable educational experience to develop ecological citizenship."

De dienst wordt in de bestuurskundige literatuur dikwijls gekoppeld aan het neoliberalisme en New Public Management. Een andere mogelijke benadering die uit voorgaande onderzoeken volgt is dat de dienst werd opgericht als een middel van de politiek om hun macht over het ambtelijke apparaat te herstellen. Dit werd het herstellen van “het primaat van de politiek” genoemd. Deze twee verklaringen zijn tegenstrijdig. Met dit onderzoek wil ik dit gat in de literatuur opvullen met een ideeënhistorische benadering van de ABD. Deze methode is ingegeven door ander recent onderzoek naar het Nederlands neoliberalisme, waar een focus op ideeën blootlegt hoe politieke hervormingen tot stand komen, zich handhaven en tot een succes worden gebracht. Ik toon in dit onderzoek aan dat de ideeën die gebruikt werden om de Algemene Bestuursdienst politiek te legitimeren in een uitgebreide traditie van bestuurlijk denken moeten worden gezien, die grotendeels buiten de kaders van het neoliberalisme en het primaat van de politiek valt. Op deze manier lever ik een bijdrage aan de literatuur over de Algemene Bestuursdienst én het Nederlandse neoliberalisme; dit laatste door in te zoomen op een hervorming op beleidsniveau binnen een overkoepelende hervorming op ideologisch niveau."
"Early Christian Funerary Feasting: Transitioning Mourning Feasts through Developing Early Christian Culture
Castro 6642713","['Castro, Mya']","['Saar, Ortal-Paz']",2022-09-09T04:01:02Z,EN,"['Early Christianity, North Africa, Funerary Feasting, Augustine of Hippo']","Ancient, Medieval and Renaissance Studies","In today’s society, there has been a rise in alternative ritual practices, through Neo-Paganism, Wicca, and other non-traditional organizations that are critical of Christianity’s history of exclusion of “The Other”. Christian rituals have long been documented by theologians through first-hand accounts, with the recognition of similarities between Christian rituals and ‘pagan’ rituals. What has not been thoroughly documented is how these similarities are purposefully done, as a means to encourage the transition of ‘pagan’ beliefs into Christian beliefs 
	The aim of this research is to acknowledge the building critique and study the development of Early Christian liturgy, so see if there is enough evidence to support the idea that Early Christians willingly adapted pagan rituals into Christian authorized rituals. This will be done while recognizing that the development of religion is often a functional tool, so the application of the Social Anthropological Functionalist theory will also be used.  
	In order to scrutinize the development of liturgy, one area was decided upon: Funerary Feasting. The nature of Christianity is based on a promised after-life through a set of expectations during life; the glorification of after-life begets Christianity as a death focused religion. Funerary Feasting was chosen as the best candidate ritual because of this. One of the most popular Christian rituals is the Eucharist, which is based off of the Last Supper of Jesus of Nazareth, a foundational event in the Christian Narrative. North Africa was the chosen site for this research because it was a massive pilgrimage site for Saints and Martyrs, another facet of the Funerary Feasting ritual. North Africa was also home to Early Christian Fathers who acknowledged Funerary Feasting as an aspect of the Christian narrative. These reports ceased by the 7th century; this is why the timeframe for this research is only between the 2nd and 7th centuries. 
	The research showed that the encouragement of the Early Christian Fathers was to break down the ritual of Funerary Feasting into different rituals. The already existing communal feasting rituals, like the ἀγάπη and the eucharist, were viable candidates the absorb areas of Funerary Feasting that were approved by the Early Christian fathers. The areas that Early Christian Fathers did not approve of needed to be adjusted into practices that could be accepted, like the Cult of Saints and Martyrs, which provided Christians with a celebratory outlet. This outlet held the festivity of Funerary Feasting, but with the lowered tolerance for ‘merrymaking’ that the Church approved of. Another measure of adjusting Funerary Feasting was done with iconography, where the Last Supper’s iconic scene is compared against the iconography of Greco-Roman totenmahls. More research should be done in regards to the development of Christian rituals both within and outside of the Mediterranean, there may be more evidence for the growing critique of how Christian development has occurred in the last 2000 years."

Para examinar la situación multilingüe en el aula, el uso de translanguaging y las actitudes, los obstáculos y las necesidades de los profesores, se ha realizado entrevistas con 5 profesores de las aulas de inmersión y se ha distribuido un cuestionario entre 32 profesores de aulas ordinarias. Los resultados procedentes del análisis cualitativo de las entrevistas y del análisis estadístico del cuestionario indican que el uso de las lenguas materas en el aula es reducido, tanto a nivel oral como a nivel escrito. La mayoría de los profesores tienen una actitud positiva en el caso de la expresión oral, pero prefieren una inmersión lingüística en castellano durante la enseñanza de la lectoescritura. Cuando los profesores tienen una actitud más positiva, utilizan las lenguas maternas más. Además, el hecho de haber vivido en el extranjero y el conocimiento de dos idiomas o más influyen positivamente en el uso del translanguaging y la actitud del profesorado. Para ampliar el uso de las lenguas maternas, los profesores necesitan más materiales, formación, tiempo, recursos humanos y colaboración mutua."

three consecutive heating periods are needed.
Afterwards, the slopes were compared with the following period slopes to identify an increase or decrease. If
there is a significant change that was determined differently in three different approaches, you can assume that
a possible reason is a newly add insulation of that household. Those household where a significant decrease

The findings of the study showed that with two linear models, linear regression and support vector regression,
significant decreases in gas consumption can be detected in the data.
These results lead to the assumption that the gas consumption and the average temperature difference per day

Tijd voor Integriteit,"['Bork, Laurens']","['Loyens, K.M.']",2022-09-13T00:00:40Z,NL,"[""ethisch leiderschap; integriteit; integriteitsdilemma's; bespreekbaarheid; leiderschap; cultuur""]","Organisaties, verandering en management","Integriteit is een essentieel onderdeel van het ambtelijk vakmanschap. Burgers moeten voor de uitvoering van overheidstaken kunnen vertrouwen op de integriteit van de ambtenaren. Integriteit is daarom een belangrijk onderdeel van het functioneren van ambtenaren. Rijkswaterstaat is een grote uitvoeringsorganisatie binnen de Rijksoverheid. Vanwege het grote publieke belang dat Rijkswaterstaat dient, is het voor burgers belangrijk dat zij op de integriteit van ambtenaren van Rijkswaterstaat kunnen rekenen.
Een belangrijk onderdeel van effectief integriteitsmanagement bij publieke organisaties is de bespreekbaarheid van integriteitsdilemma’s. Leiderschap lijkt een rol te spelen in de bespreekbaarheid van integriteitsdilemma’s. In dit onderzoek staat de vraag hoe ethisch leiderschap kan bijdragen aan de bespreekbaarheid van integriteitsdilemma’s bij een organisatieonderdeel van Rijkswaterstaat. Ethisch leiderschap is een leiderschapsstijl die de ethische besluitvorming en het moreel bewustzijn van medewerkers bevordert. Om de onderzoeksvraag te kunnen beantwoorden is gebruik gemaakt van kwalitatief onderzoek. Er zijn interviews afgenomen met medewerkers en leidinggevenden van Rijkswaterstaat.
In de resultaten is de voornaamste bijdrage van ethisch leiderschap aan de bespreekbaarheid van integriteitsdilemma’s de verlaging van de drempel voor publiek professionals. De drempel om integriteitsdilemma’s te bespreken kent verschillende oorzaken. Deze oorzaken worden gevonden in de cultuur van de organisatie. Ten eerste is een resultaat-gedreven cultuur met hoge werkdruk van negatieve invloed op de bespreekbaarheid van integriteitsdilemma’s, omdat medewerkers weinig prioritering hebben voor het signaleren van dilemma’s of het stilstaan bij dilemma’s. Daarnaast zorgt deze cultuur voor weinig tijd bij leidinggevenden. Hierdoor voelen publiek professionals zich eerder bezwaard om aan te kloppen bij hun leidinggevenden, ondanks dat die ruimte wel woordelijk wordt geboden. Verder vervallen leidinggevenden door resultaatgedrevenheid sneller in moreel-neutraal management gericht op het behalen van de primaire doelstellingen. Publiek professionals percipiëren hierdoor minder ruimte voor integriteitsdilemma’s, maar ook minder ruimte voor tegenspraak. Respondenten spreken daarom ook wel van een impliciete integriteitscultuur. Ten slotte vormt ook thuiswerken een drempel, omdat medewerkers de digitale setting minder geschikt vinden voor het bespreken van integriteitsdilemma’s.
Binnen de impliciete integriteitscultuur met drempels voor de bespreekbaarheid, is expliciete aandacht voor integriteitsdilemma’s extra noodzakelijk. Leiders die integer zijn en zichtbaar integer voorbeeldgedrag vertonen, verlagen de drempel om integriteitsdilemma’s te bespreken. Expliciete, periodieke aandacht voor integriteitsdilemma’s vanuit leiders verlaagt voor publiek professionals de drempel om eigen dilemma’s te bespreken. Die expliciete, periodieke aandacht kan geschonken worden op verschillende manieren. Zo zijn integriteitskwesties die spelen in de organisatie een goede kans om integriteitsdilemma’s bespreekbaar te maken, maar vatten sommige publiek professionals reactieve, incident-gedreven aandacht voor integriteit cynisch op. Zij zien liever structurele, proactieve aandacht voor dilemma’s. Een goede manier om dit te doen lijkt het behandelen van voorbeelden van integriteitsdilemma’s uit de werkpraktijk. Casussen waarbij het juiste antwoord niet voorhanden is lijken daarvoor het meest geschikt. Regelmatige behandeling van herkenbare casuïstiek verhoogt het signaleringsvermogen en integriteitsbewustzijn van publiek professionals. Een andere manier waarop ethische leiders de drempel kunnen verlagen is door zichtbaar moreel voorbeeldgedrag te tonen. Dit lijkt extra nodig in een werkcontext waarin er veel werkdruk bestaat en de zichtbaarheid en benaderbaarheid van leide"
Teaching catalysis as a means to enhance scientific literacy amongst chemistry students in Dutch secondary education - An explorative investigation,"['Atteveld, Laurens']","['Prins, Gjalt']",2022-09-13T00:00:45Z,EN,['Secondary education; chemistry; teaching; catalysis'],Science Education and Communication,"In order to develop scientific literacy, students should be encountered with relevant teaching material that is true to nature to the field of practice as it is today. Comparing a conceptual framework with an analysis of current Dutch teaching methods in secondary chemistry education showed that an incoherence has occurred between the fragmented and thinly approach to the concept of catalysis relative to the important factor it plays in the field of research. In an attempt to minimalize the mismatch between these aspects, prototypical educational material on the fundamental concepts of different types of catalysts has been developed and tested in a design based research in natural classroom setting. Using the jigsaw method, students were assigned to write an advisory report stating if either a heterogeneous-, homogeneous- or biocatalyst was most suitable to be used in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The reports consisted of statements regarding one of five catalytic aspects: activity; availability; safety; stability and recovery, written in the style of Toulmin’s model of argumentation. Along with these statements, written answers on questions in the module and a short interview were used for qualitative data processing by means of open coding. Achieved learning outcomes were drawn up and compared to the intended outcomes. The module was found to be effective in developing conceptual understanding around the aspect of activity. Although discovering some misconceptions of several groups interpreting the following statement the wrong way around, most groups made correct statements such that a catalyst is most suitable to be used if it decreases more of the initial activation energy of the reaction. Though other aspects did not result to the intended outcomes, the exploratory module could be a useful start to a catalysis centralized approach which enables students to gain an in-depth conceptual understanding of the domain of catalysis and thereby becoming more scientific literate."

However, user-generated content is not always reliable and can cause health problems, especially since it is difficult to distinguish between credible and unreliable information. Multiple studies have been done on automatic credibility assessment of online media, but not specifically sexual health information. These studies make use of markers that may indicate misinformation. Therefore, this study aims to obtain an overview of these markers and to examine whether and how these markers can be applied to the automatic credibility evaluation of user-generated sexual health data.
Based on the literature, this study created a comprehensive overview of all content-based markers (i.e., markers that could be derived from the text) that aided in credibility detection. A subset of these markers was modelled on the data using both supervised machine learning and more conventional methods. Subsequently, their relationships were examined to see if they aligned with the literature.
This study illustrates the disagreement between the existing literature on how the markers aid in credibility detection. Besides, the results indicate that there were no relationships between the vast majority of markers. This may be the first indication that most markers from the literature cannot be generalised to the automatic credibility assessment of sexual health data. However, this cannot be said with certainty due to the lack of a labelled dataset. The study listed several ideas for future research if a labelled dataset became available, which emphasized the idea that content-based markers should be used in combination with other markers."

However, a friction with their educational approach can appear: pursuits towards global justice and social equality are entangled and could reinforce those neoliberal values they critique by becoming commodities (Pais and Costa 2020). University students, who aim to contribute to collective social change, can feel frustrations around the pressured focus on individual achievement, productivity, and competition.
I base these frustrations on my ethnographic fieldwork among university Master’s students who are members of the Young Innovators Honours Program (YIP) at Utrecht University, in the Netherlands. YIP shifted to a regenerative way of making change by its practices (Wahl 2016). They answer the leading question of this ethnography: how Western academic institutes can support university Master’s students to navigate contemporary social challenges and reconstruct themselves as regenerative changemakers. The practices, I argue, turned individualism, said to be a source of frustration, into possibility, by the three main pillars of regenerative change: reveal authenticity, support collaboration, and encourage reflective crafting.
Ethnographic fieldwork can help understand this process as it reveals students’ lived experiences (Hammersley and Atkinson 2019). Being a participant and a researcher, I rely on participant observation, autoethnography, and the creation of a podcast series to assess students’ perspective. I suggest that academic institutes’ contribution to social change should start with changing their educational practices to support students’ development holistically. Regenerative changemaking practices created a social space in which students learned to navigate their frustrations and reconstructed themselves as regenerative changemakers."

Looking at people’s narratives and practices about trees, this research examines the meanings of human-tree relationships from a project-organisational, human (people) and multispecies (the tree) perspective. The affective encounters in a co-habited urban environment and reciprocal connections between trees and people are explained by reviewing the human experience of tree symbolism, historicity and different temporalities, the identification (identity-making) of people with trees, the practices of exchanging care and services and feelings of affection, respect or pride for trees.
Seeing trees as agents in producing these outcomes, this study explores the space they inhabit (tree-space) and uses the terms ‘life network’ and ‘cohabitation’ to examine human- tree relationships. On the one hand the practice of ‘tree nomination’ is a response to processes of commodification of trees, urbanization, and a bureaucratic and anthropocentric take on life in cities (tree bureaucracy) in the Anthropocene. On the other hands, this thesis also acknowledges shifting ideas on how to describe the cultural division between human and non-human life from a multispecies perspective and introduces the idea of a continuum to describe these shifts. To expand the applicability of this study beyond academia, local authorities could embrace dialogues with residents to acknowledge the roles that trees play in the life networks of urban co-inhabitants."

This thesis looked into the sustainability conceptualizations that are adopted and executed by taking a look at both the municipal system and a bottom-up initiative called Kaskantine.
The first chapter provides insight information on the municipal system and the Doughnut Economy. I have highlighted analogies between the transition to a Doughnut Economy and important concerns that are found by previous researchers in sustainable transitions.
The second chapter is summarizing a micro-social situation where concerned citizens gather at a grassroots initiative in Amsterdam Nieuw-West called the Kaskantine. Borrowing Isin's re-orientation of citizenship I use his concept of  ""acts of citizenship"", to demonstrate what practices the founders of the citizen-led initiative the Kaskantine utilize to oppose and alter the ""unsustainable"" hegemonic ideologies and institutions that govern the city. Making claims on rights to ecological and social justice, these activities offer insights into how sustainability is viewed and asserted from a holistic standpoint.
Finally, this thesis documents how citizen-led activities in Amsterdam Nieuw-West have opened up a local partnership between the Kaskantine and a representative of the Amsterdam municipality. In this way citizens are, similar like municipalists, looking for a democratic transformation of cities, to resist growing inequalities, democratic deficits and social injustices."
Identifying the river sources and the ocean dynamics of floating plastic in the Galápagos Archipelago,"['Ren, Jiongqiu']","['Sebille, Erik van']",2022-09-14T00:01:33Z,EN,[],Climate Physics,"The increase of ocean plastic in the Gal ́apagos Archipelago receives more and more attention in recent years. However, the sources and the potential processes that cause the locally found plastic remain unknown. In previous research, the emerged plastic on Gal ́apagos coastlines is proved to be more likely from external sources. Among all the land-based plastic sources, riverine plastic inputs to the ocean are considered the main sources. In this research, we attribute the Gal ́apagos plastic to the major riverine sources on the west coastlines of America based on a Bayesian inference framework. Rivers in Panama Bight and Surrounding Regions are the most likely sources. We also found that most of the particles from the Panama Bight and Surrounding Regions only arrive in the Gal ́apagos from January to April. Particles from North Humboldt Current System also show an episodic nature of arrivals, but the arrival time is more spread throughout the years. Using a high-resolution ocean surface currents model, we simulate the pathways of virtual floating plastic particles from the river sources to the Gal ́apagos region. We analyzed the pathways and potential ocean dynamics that cause the episodic arrivals. A Panama Jet Current is first defined in this research and is considered to be responsible for most of the plastic arriving in the Gal ́apagos from the Panama Bight and Surrounding Regions. Humboldt Current is expected to transport most of the particles from North Humboldt Current System sources to the Gal ́apagos. Attributing the riverine sources and identifying the ocean transporting dynamics help to better understand the episodic nature of arriving particles in the Gal ́apagos Archipelago. Eventually, we are one step closer to predicting the arrival time of plastic in the Gal ́apagos Archipelago."
Promises of Care,"['Luke, Carmen']","['Saraf, A.']",2022-09-14T00:01:35Z,EN,['Anthropocene; Curation; Domesticity; Home; Homeliness; Unhomeliness.'],Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"Living in a time considered the Anthropocene may bring about grievous feelings, and for some, 
even feelings of unhomeliness. The accelerated anthropogenic ecological and climatic changes and 
their diverse effects on human and more-than-human lives have increasingly become apparent, 
and thus worrying. As those changes directly result from human activities, people have started to 
question what it means to be human. How to feel ‘at home’ living in the Anthropocene is a pressing
question for some, and this question may also be explored within the four walls of what they call 
their home. While physical shelter may be a basic existential need, it is houses and homes, wrapped 
up in the desire and struggle for belonging in the world, which underpin human sociality.
Considering the need to ‘care’, ‘nurture’ and ‘protect’ nature during this epoch, I uncovered how 
a person’s care practised within the domestic sphere tends to expand to beings outside the domestic 
unit – to beings on the other side of the world, beings of other species, rivers, and overall nature 
in its broadest sense. The curation of the domestic sphere itself may be impacted as certain objects 
within the home have extended significance that may well represent violence, suffering, and 
exploitation rather than care. As such, by exploring how certain materialities may be invited into
or averted from the homes of people living in currently relatively unaffected areas in the 
Netherlands, namely the Randstad, this may be seen as a practice of care, as well as an 
experimentation of how to feel at home in the Anthropocene. As I investigated (gendered) 
categories of care by exploring how they may become reconfigured within the context of caring 
for nature while living within the Anthropocene, they indicate how domesticity becomes 
reconfigured within the context of climate change mitigation and sustainability. Through a focus
on materials, I traced phenomenological and aesthetical meanings of certain objects together with 
how the larger collective may enable or constrain a person’s ability to feel at home in the 
Anthropocene. To conclude, I argue for a reinvention of domesticity, where the current climate

Wolves Between the Lines of Nature & Culture,"['Lenstra, Eelke']","['Cremers, Gijs']",2022-09-14T00:01:21Z,EN,['Wolves; shepherds; agriculture; rewilding; multispecies ethnography; Plantationocene; coexistence'],Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"This thesis explores the ways in which the wolf’s return to the Netherlands shapes human and other-than-human assemblages in the Veluwe with an emphasis on its Southern-Western region. Through my engagements with all kinds of human and other-than-human actors within the assemblage, I discovered how the wolf currently navigates the landscape and how its return challenges dominant notions and imaginaries rooted in nature-culture binaries. The Plantationocene serves as a lens here through which I observed the field of tension in the area between agriculture and ‘conservation/rewilding’ of nature, demarcated by boundaries and fences. The wolf, continuously crossing these human-made boundaries, interrogates our perceptions of Dutch ‘nature’, and in particular alienation, (salvage) accumulation and the scalability of other-than-human nature. In addition, following the wolfs’ multispecies engagements has led me to the collaborative work of shepherds, sheep, dogs, heather, and wolves in capitalist ruins, and to what they can tell us about collaborative survival in these troubling times. By applying Tsing’s (2018) concept of ‘domestication-as-rewilding’ to their ability to live in the mess’s capitalism has left us with, I attempt to offer a source of inspiration in imagining multispecies life."

integriteitsbeleid moet voeren. Het hebben van een formeel integriteitsbeleid is echter geen garantie dat medewerkers ook daadwerkelijk integer handelen. Maar wat werkt dan wel? Voor dit onderzoek is de kennis van het sterke HRM-systeem uit de HRM-literatuur toegepast op integriteit, waarbij de verwachting is dat het creëren van een sterk integriteitssysteem bijdraagt aan het behalen van de organisatiedoelen: het bevorderen van integer handelen. Daarbij draait het om de percepties die medewerkers hebben van het integriteitssysteem of het een sterk integriteitssysteem is. De vraag is echter hoe de medewerkerspercepties van een (sterk) integriteitssysteem tot stand komen.

Doel- Het doel van het onderzoek is om te achterhalen hoe de medewerkerspercepties van een (sterk) integriteitssysteem worden gevormd en welke rol de samenwerking van leidinggevenden en de integriteitscoördinator daarin speelt om daarmee uiteindelijk integer handelen in publieke organisaties te bevorderen. Tevens is het doel HRM- en integriteitsliteratuur te integreren door ontwikkeling van het concept ‘het sterke integriteitssysteem’. De centrale onderzoeksvraag luidt: ‘Welke rol speelt de samenwerking van leidinggevenden en de integriteitscoördinator bij de totstandkoming van medewerkerspercepties van het integriteitssysteem?’.

Methode- Het kwalitatieve, exploratieve onderzoek is een cross-sectionele casestudy en uitgevoerd bij een Nederlandse publieke uitvoeringsorganisatie aan de hand van focusgroepen met medewerkers(N=16, 56% V) en leidinggevenden (N=8, 50% V) en een semigestructureerd interview met de integriteitscoördinator(N=1).

Resultaten- Uit de resultaten is allereerst naar voren gekomen dat conform de medewerkerspercepties vier van de negen kenmerken van het integriteitssysteem aanwezig zijn in de organisatie. Daarnaast bleek dat voor de ruime meerderheid van de medewerkers voornamelijk leidinggevenden een rol spelen bij de totstandkoming van percepties van het integriteitssysteem. Dit betreft een directe rol door middel van bijvoorbeeld gesprekken en voorbeeldgedrag. De integriteitscoördinator speelt ook een rol bij de totstandkoming van medewerkerspercepties, namelijk via het indiensttredingstraject, indirect via het delen van informatie via Rijksportaal of via dilemmatrainingen. Ook directe collega’s lijken een rol te spelen bij de totstandkoming van medewerkerspercepties. De samenwerking van de leidinggevenden en de integriteitscoördinator verschilt per leidinggevende, waarbij de meerderheid van de leidinggevenden aangeeft dat er geen, of geen nauwe samenwerking is met de integriteitscoördinator. Het meeste contact is overwegend vraag gestuurd vanuit leidinggevenden ten aanzien van een specifieke vraag of dilemma.

Conclusie- Samenvattend kan geconcludeerd worden dat zowel de leidinggevenden als de integriteitscoördinator een rol spelen bij de totstandkoming van medewerkerspercepties van het integriteitssysteem in de organisatie. Of ook de samenwerking van de leidinggevende en de integriteitscoördinator een rol heeft gespeeld bij de totstandkoming van medewerkerspercepties, kan op basis van de resultaten niet worden geconcludeerd."
Christianity after the Death of God: Christian atheism and the materiality of absence,"['Kooijmans, Leon']","['Meyer, Birgit']",2022-10-01T00:00:42Z,EN,['Death of God; Emerging Christianity; Radical Theology; Material Religion; Felt Absence; Christian Atheism; Post-theism; Postmodern Christianity'],Religious Studies,"Since the 1990s, an increasing amount of (post-)evangelical Christians in North America and Europe sought to form communities in creative and innovative ways. Disillusioned with capitalist economies, Enlightenment thinking and conservative trends within Evangelical culture, these Emerging Christians, as they came to be called, desired to engage Christianity anew from a postmodern context. One notable group associated with this Emerging Church Movement is called ‘Ikon’, a small collective of artists and disillusioned Christians, agnostics and atheists located in Belfast, Northern Ireland that was active from 2001 to 2013.

Critical of Christians and atheists alike, Ikon is situated on the boundaries of what is conventionally meant by terms such as ‘Christian’, ‘religious’, and ‘atheist’. Ikon embraces modern and postmodern atheist critiques of theism and religion while simultaneously rooting themselves in distinctively Christian traditions, practices, and objects. Indeed, Ikon takes its inspiration from the history of Christianity and atheism in order to live out a Christianity beyond theism. Because of this, research on communities such as Ikon provide promising pathways for the study of religion and non-religion, offering new insights on the dynamics and entanglements of religiosity, spiritual and everyday life in the twenty-first century.

This thesis explores the ways in which Ikon navigates between Christianity and atheism, religion and non-religion, and divine presence and absence. In particular, it asks how the death of God is conceptualized and mediated in Ikon’s performances which centre transformation and disruption. By employing a grounded philosophical approach, the chapters provide extensive reflections on the experience and materiality of absence both for communities such as Ikon and for the academic study of religion."

Daarmee is schrijven niet alleen een lastige activiteit voor de schrijver, maar is het ook lastig om te leren. Van havoleerlingen wordt verwacht dat zij aan het einde van hun middelbare schoolperiode op niveau 3F zitten, maar doordat de leerlingen druk bezig zijn met de schrijftaak, komt er weinig terecht van het ‘leren schrijven’. Dit gewenste niveau wordt door de leerlingen dan ook lang niet altijd bereikt. Om ervoor te zorgen dat leerlingen het schrijven als minder lastig gaan ervaren en om cognitieve ruimte te maken om te leren, is het van belang om het werkgeheugen minder te belasten. In dit onderzoek wordt dat gedaan door eerst een tekst te schrijven en die in een volgende les te reviseren. De leerlingen hoeven de tweede les veel minder over de inhoud van hun tekst na te denken en kunnen zo ‘leren schrijven’. Leerlingen herschrijven hun tekst in drie condities: de videofeedbackconditie, de docentfeedbackconditie en de geen-feedbackconditie. 
Leerlingen in de videofeedbackconditie hebben de beste tweede versie geschreven. Ook in de twee andere condities is de herschreven versie gemiddeld van hogere kwaliteit dan de eerste versie. Echter, er kan niet aangetoond worden dat het verschil tussen de eerste en tweede versie verschilt tussen de docent- en de geen-feedbackconditie. De leerlingen uit de docentfeedbackconditie vonden de feedback het duidelijkst. Leerlingen vinden het wellicht fijn om feedback te ontvangen van een docent, maar die feedback heeft er niet voor gezorgd dat de herschreven versies van betere kwaliteit waren dan de herschreven versies van de geen-feedbackconditie. Vervolgonderzoek naar wat en hoe vaak iets aangepast is in een tekst, kan meer informatie geven over hoe door de verschillende feedbackvormen de teksten van de leerlingen verbeterd zijn. De leerlingen uit de videofeedbackconditie waren betrokken en ervaarden deze lessen als leuk. Dit kan te maken hebben met de nieuwheid van dit soort feedback. Vervolgonderzoek kan uitwijzen of dit aan het nieuwheidseffect ligt."

In dit onderzoek staat het Metropole Orkest als context centraal. Het Metropole Orkest is een professioneel (symfonisch) Jazz- en Poporkest uit Nederland en begeeft zich in een speelveld waarin maatschappelijke, politieke en economische ontwikkelingen institutionele dynamiek veroorzaken (WRR, 2015). Het Metropole Orkest begeeft zich daardoor in een krachtenveld waarin artistieke, economische en maatschappelijke invloeden bijeenkomen. De doelstelling van dit onderzoek was om ervaringen van musici en stafleden van het Metropole Orkest met dit krachtenveld bloot te leggen en deze toe te passen op de theorie van institutionele logica’s en hybride professionalisme om kennis te genereren die eraan bijdraagt dat het Metropole Orkest een duurzame omgangsvorm vindt met de hybridisatie van de Nederlandse cultuursector en een plek krijgt in de wetenschappelijke discussie(s) hierover. Hybridisatie is het bijeenkomen van het professionalisme en het managerialisme. Twee verschillende institutionele logica’s uit het (semi) publieke domein en de economie. Institutionele logica’s zijn principes uit een veld die het gedrag van mensen en organisaties in dat veld sturen. Een onderzoeksmethode die hierbij past is een etnografie, omdat dit ertoe dient om ervaringen van musici en stafleden van het Metropole Orkest met de situatie in het speelveld van Nederlandse professionele orkest bloot te leggen (Bryman, 2015; Maxwell, 2013). De onderzoeksvraag om dit alles te volbrengen is: wat betekent de hybridisatie van de Nederlandse cultuursector voor de musici en de stafleden van het Metropole Orkest?
De resultaten in dit onderzoek geven weer dat de hybridisatie van de cultuursector uiteenlopende spanningsvelden creëert voor de musici en de stafleden van het Metropole Orkest. Een belangrijke bevinding die hieraan voorafgaat is dat het artistieke professionalisme op zichzelf een kwestie is van institutionele complexiteit, omdat het gaat over artistieke hoogwaardigheid en een maatschappelijk kompas en daarmee om twee verschillende en tegenstrijdende logica’s. De invloed van een derde logica, het economische zet de van oudsher bestaande dialoog tussen het artistieke en het maatschappelijke (sterk) onder druk en veroorzaakt problematische spanningsvelden voor de musici en stafleden van het Metropole Orkest."
"Using a 148km long cross-section of Holocene deposits, to study natural subsidence along the Dutch coastal plain","['Andeweg, Mathijs']","['Cohen, Kim']",2022-10-01T00:00:50Z,EN,"['Middle-Holocene, Cross-section, interpolation, Subsidence, glacio-isotasy, peat']",Earth Surface and Water,"This two-part research into subsidence over the Dutch coastal plain uses a 147.7 km long cross-section to study
differences in subsidence between the south and the north of the Netherlands. The focus lies on splitting the
total natural subsidence into three components: Glacio-isostatic adjustment due to the collapse of the
peripheral forebulge when the Scandinavian-British ice sheet started to melt; Tectonic subsidence, caused by
the lowering of the North Sea depocentre; And, compaction of Middle-Holocene peat layers, due to peat
compression and oxidation.
In the first part, a vertical profile is created that describes lithogenetic units along the full cross-section, with a
focus on Noord-Holland where lithological descriptions are scarce. The lithological relations from the crosssection, in combination with 14C samples, are used to create isochrones that span the whole study area. The
depths of the isochrones are measured at 5km intervals. These values are used to calculate spatial isochrone
depth differences, which provides a quantification of differential subsidence. The results from this exercise
were compared to interpolated subsidence values from parallel research by De Wit et al., (in prep.) and used to
quantify differences in reconstructed and interpolated isochrones characteristics.
Comparing differential subsidence along the cross-section shows that in the north isochrones lie up to two
meters deeper compared to the south. This difference is largely described by subsidence due to glacio-isostatic
adjustment and tectonic subsidence. However, subsidence due to peat compaction also causes large
differences in isochrone depths. Peat compaction is a likely cause to why the reconstructed isochrones are
found deeper compared to the interpolated isochrones from De Wit et al., (in prep.), which excludes this effect
of compaction."

The research tools used are a survey, interviews, a focus group discussion, and a literature review.

Summary of findings
The diaspora has a diverse array of skills and expertise, and are willing to utilize for Suriname’s benefit. 
The majority of the diaspora has engaged in sending remittances, both financial and non-financial. 
The largest group of the diaspora has no engagement with official diaspora organizations. 
There is a distrust between the diaspora, the Surinamese people and government. The diaspora has several concerns such as high crime rates, corruption, lower quality of life, and healthcare. 
These concerns prevent the diaspora from returning to, advocating for or investing funds in Suriname."
A Comparative Life Cycle Analysis of The Modern Milkman’s Reusable Glass Milk Bottle,"['Carter, Eleanor']","['Worrell, Ernst']",2022-10-01T00:00:37Z,EN,['Life cycle analysis; sustainable packaging; plastic free packaging; reusable packaging; circular economy'],Sustainable Development,"The life cycle analysis (LCA) of The Modern Milkman’s reusable glass bottles is compared against the life cycles of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles and beverage cartons, to decide which packaging material had a higher carbon footprint. This shorthand LCA gives an indication on the carbon impact, taking into consideration manufacture, processing, distribution, cleaning, and EoL scenarios. This research is done on the behalf of The Modern Milkman, a company delivering milk and other fast moving consumer goods to customers around the UK. 

This thesis concludes that reusable glass bottles is proven to be less carbon impactful compared to HDPE bottles and beverage cartons at a present return rate of 81%. Manufacturing is the most impactful stage of the supply chain for all packaging materials. Cleaning and distribution is an added impact for reusable glass bottles. Regarding the end-of-life scenarios of packaging, recycling of single-use alternatives is possible, yet implications with the UK recycling infrastructure is a barrier. In truth, it is ambiguous if the UKs waste is being managed properly, with much of it being sent abroad.

 A breakeven point is calculated, which defines the number of times the reusable glass bottle should be used to have comparable environmental impacts as the single-use alternative. Here, the reusable bottle has to be reused 1.7 times compared to 1L HDPE bottles, and 2.0 times compared to 1L beverage cartons. When the return rate of the glass bottles increases, the number of use cycles increases, causing the production emissions to be spread over a longer lifecycle of the bottle. When the volume of single-use bottles increases, the total carbon footprint decreases and when the recycled content of the HDPE and glass bottles increases, the carbon footprint decreases."

Overstromingen en 
extreme vormen van weer komen steeds vaker in het nieuws. De gevolgen hiervan voor vastgoed en de 
haalbaarheid van woningbouwontwikkelingen komen hiermee onder druk te staan. In dit onderzoek 
wordt onderzocht of de gevolgen van klimaatverandering financieel te kwantificeren zijn als 
klimaatrisico’s in de financieel-economische planbegeleiding. 

Door middel van literatuuronderzoek en het uitvoeren van een casestudy wordt onderzocht of 
klimaatrisico’s en de waardedaling die dit met zich zal meebrengen, financieel te kwantificeren zijn en 
hoe deze risico’s verdisconteerd kunnen worden. 

De financiële risico’s van klimaatverandering en de waardedaling van vastgoed als gevolg hiervan kan 
financieel worden verdisconteerd over een langere periode. Het onderzoek neemt 2050 en 2100 als 
uitgangspunten, aangezien deze jaartallen worden gezien als belangrijke kantelpunten in het bestrijden 
van klimaatverandering. 

De financieel-economische planbegeleiding van woningbouwprojecten kan door middel van financiële 
klimaatrisico’s verdisconteerd worden over woningbouwprojecten. De waardedaling die kan optreden 
kan met behulp van een maandelijkse of jaarlijkse bijdrage gedekt worden. Op deze manier kan op 
gebiedsniveau bepaald worden wat de risico’s zijn van een gebied en welk percentage waardedaling 
verwacht kan worden. 

De conclusie van het onderzoek is dan ook dat klimaatverandering door middel van een jaarlijkse 
bijdrage verdisconteerd kan worden naar de toekomst. De waardedaling kan worden afgedekt door een 
extra belasting voor gebieden die een verhoogd risico lopen. Met deze methode kan per gebied een 
exploitatie opgesteld worden waarin deze risico’s verantwoord worden. Binnen deze verantwoording is 
dan de mogelijke waardedaling van het vastgoed bepaalt aan de hand van het risico dat een gebied loopt. 
Een andere mogelijkheid is door het totale bedrag van waardedaling vooraf te investeren in mitigerende 
maatregelen. Het gaat hier dan om de bepaling van de fysieke directe gevolgen van klimaatverandering, 
aan de hand van een risicopercentage, maar moet op basis van een inschatting van het totale 
waardeverlies blijken of het beter is om op gebiedsniveau te investeren in mitigatie of op gebouwniveau 
op de waarde van de woning. Uiteindelijk moet dit leiden tot een te investeren bedrag dat het financiële 
risico meer verkleint dan dat het zou kosten.  

Het onderzoek richt zich op de financiële kant van woningbouwontwikkeling en minder op de 
beleidsmatige kant van de woningbouwopgave. Ook rest de vraag of het onderzoek momenteel relevant 
is, of dat het pas over 20 jaar relevant zou worden, aangezien de effecten van klimaatverandering nu 
langzaamaan pas zichtbaar aan het worden zijn. De risico’s zijn momenteel nog relatief laag en 
exploiterende partijen kunnen daardoor het risico nu nog nemen. Gezien het huidige regeringsbeleid 
met betrekking tot duurzamer wonen (en dit heeft toch echt financiële consequenties) lijkt het geen 
optie om dit naar de verre toekomst te verschuiven."
"Socioeconomic status, social influence and regular leisure-time physical activity: the mediating roles and relative importance of role modelling, social support and subjective social norm","['Deventer, Melody van']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2022-10-10T23:02:21Z,EN,['regular leisure-time physical activity; socioeconomic status; role modelling; social support; social norm'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: People with low socioeconomic status (SES) are less likely to do regular leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), however, there is a lack of knowledge on the mediating roles and relative importance of social influence in this relationship. Therefore, this research examines the hypothesis that role modelling, social support and subjective social norm mediate the relationship between SES and regular LTPA, where social support is expected to be the most important type of social influence, respectively followed by role modelling and subjective social norm.
Methods: 2360 participants of the Dutch longitudinal GLOBE-study of 2014 (54.3% female, Mage = 47.9 years, SDage = 15.5 years) fully completed a postal questionnaire measuring educational level (i.e., the SES-indicator), regular LTPA, and role modelling, social support and subjective social norm for regular physical activity. Logistic regressions and mediation analyses, using PROCESS, were used to assess the relationship between SES and regular LTPA, and the mediating effects and relative importance of the social influences. 
Results: Participants in the highest educational group (OR = 2.86, 95% CI [1.80, 4.56]) were more likely to do regular LTPA than their lower-status counterparts. SES was positively associated with subjective social norm, and all social influences were positively associated with regular LTPA. The association between SES and regular LTPA was partially mediated by subjective social norm, but not mediated by role modelling and social support, as both social influences were not significantly associated with SES.
Conclusions: Subjective social norm for regular physical activity contributes to the explanation of socioeconomic differences in regular LTPA. Results suggest that intervention and policy strategies to reduce socioeconomic differences in regular LTPA and, ultimately, in health, would benefit from raising the social norm for regular LTPA in lower SES-groups. Future research may further investigate which other pathways are driving the relationship between SES and regular LTPA."
Intestinal zoonotic parasites in dogs and foxes in an Echinococcus multilocularis endemic area (Limburg),"['Boelen, Fleur']","['Nijsse, Rolf']",2022-10-10T23:02:07Z,EN,[],One Health,"Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and dogs (Canis familiaris) are definitive hosts for zoonotic parasites such as Echinococcus multilocularis, Taenia sp., Toxocara canis, Ancylostoma sp., and Giardia duodenalis. Eggs/cystst of these parasites, shed by these animals, can infect humans, and thus poses a public health concern. The occurrence of the zoonotic tapeworm E. multilocularis, that can cause severe disease in a small number of humans, was previously reported in the fox population in South-Limburg. The occurrence of this parasite was expected to be extending in northwesterly direction. Current study was designed to determine the occurrence of E. multilocularis in Limburg and assess the possible northward extension of its occurrence. Hunters in mid-and north Limburg were asked to send in fecal samples from foxes. Fox (n=46) scats were analyzed by magnetic capture-based DNA extraction and qPCR for the presence of E. multilocularis. Additionally, the role of dogs as definitive hosts of E. multilocularis was investigated, as well as the occurrence of multiple other zoonotic parasites in dogs. Dog owners in Limburg were asked to participate in the study by sending in fecal samples of their dog(s). Fecal samples (n=125) of domestic dogs from Limburg were analyzed by centrifuge sedimentation flotation and FLOTAC. Associations between dogs’ lifestyles/behaviors and patent infections were evaluated using answers of a questionnaire filled out by dog owners Awareness about E. multilocularis was assessed among dog owners as well as veterinarians and pet store owners both being selling points of anthelmintics.

There was no evidence found that the endemic area for E. multilocularis has expanded to more northern parts of Limburg. Two positive samples (22.2%; 95% confidence interval 0 – 49.1%) were however found in the control area (adjacent to Maastricht). Additionally, no E. multilocularis cases were found in dogs. The majority of veterinarians give advice to (some) dog owners about E. multilocularis in the area, but their knowledge about risk factors is not always accurate. Only 31% of the participating veterinarians, occasionally advice a deworming frequency of the recommended 12 times a year for E. multilocularis. Results of the questionnaire also suggest that deworming schemes adhered to by owners for dogs at risk for E. multilocularis infection are largely inadequate. Patent infections of other zoonotic parasites are occurrent in the dog population. Likely due to a small sample size, no behavioral risk factors for patent infections could be identified."

This study investigates concepts such as social isolation, social participation, social networks, and social capital to examine how they can improve one's well-being and aid in societal integration. Non-profit organisations such as PAO are critical in this area, not only because they directly assist them by providing them with opportunities to learn new skills and develop their personal development, but also because they indirectly assist them by providing a safe space where they can interact with others and form ties with locals and other organisations that may be of assistance to them in the future. As a result, the indirect support is the primary focus of this study; two qualitative methodologies are used in addition to theoretical applications: participant observation and 15 semi-structured interviews. It is clear that making new bonding and bridging ties and increasing one's social network is not only necessary but critical for one's well-being, especially for this group of people who had none of the mentioned ties upon arriving in a new country."

In this research, the socio-demographic composition of the people who attend these lectures is investigated. According to the theory, higher educated people are more likely to attend these lectures. Reasons for this are not just lack of understanding and lack of interest among lower educated people, but also habitus plays a role. This concept, developed by Bourdieu (1990), defines why people feel (un)comfortable in a place or situation depending on the environment that they grew up in. Furthermore, this research investigates a moderating relationship of seeing science on social media on the relationship between educational level and attending the lectures or talks about science. We expect a negative moderating relationship, because we theorize that seeing science on social media could work as a buffer on the direct relationship. For this research, an existing dataset by PewResearch was used with a sample size of 2731 respondents. Logistic regression analysis was used in order to test the hypotheses. In line with what was expected, the results show a positive relationship between educational level and attending the lectures and talks about science. The moderating effect, however, was found to be not significant. In the conclusion and discussion section, these findings are explained.

Background: Sexual violence (SV) and sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) has become
more. Different organizations have brought more attention to the issue. SV and sexual IPV as well as victim blaming can have serious health implications for people. The current paper explores the effect of perspective taking, either perpetrator or victim, on the evaluation of a sexual IPV scenario as coerced. And how gender and previous experience with SV influence this.
Method: participants of the study (N= 789,) had to rate two of the same vignettes about sexual IPV on how coerced they perceived it. In one of the vignettes, they had to take the victim perspective and in the other the perpetrator. The study has a 2 (perspective taking, within subjects) by 2 (gender, between subjects) by 2 (previous SV, between subjects) multifactorial design. Perspective taking is measured within subjects, a repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted
Results: A significant effect was found for perspective taking. Respondents rated the vignette as more coerced in the perpetrator perspective than the victim perspective. There was not an interaction effect between perspective, gender, and experience. There was a main effect for gender. Women rated the scenario as more coerced than men. No significance was found for the main effect of experience.
Discussion/conclusion: Hypercorrection because of socially desirable answers could have influenced the evaluation of the scenario as more coerced by the perpetrator perspective. More research needs to be done on perspective taking, as well as the effect on victim blaming, and experience.

However, scholars indicate that social trust is under pressure in the increasingly ethnic diverse Dutch neighbourhoods. Promoting contacts amongst neighbours in these ethnic diverse neighbourhoods is viewed as countermeasure to the detrimental effect of ethnic diversity on trust amongst neighbours. The aim of this study is to get a deeper understanding, of the relationship between perceived neighbourhood diversity and social trust amongst neighbours. Further, it examines the influence neighbourhood contacts have on this relationship. To this end, the data of the LISS (Longitudinal Internet studies for the Social Sciences) panel administered by CentERdata (Tilburg University, The Netherlands) on neighbourhood perceptions were analysed. By running a multiple linear regression, the effect of perceived neighbourhood perceptions on general social trust in neighbours, as well as the interaction effects of perceived neighbourhood diversity with neighbours in general and neighbours of another origin, were investigated. The analysis was run separately for the group of native Dutch residents and those with a migration background, as perceived neighbourhood diversity was expected to have different effects on general trust in neighbours of both groups. The findings of the present study show that for both groups perceived ethnic diversity lower general social trust in neighbours. Against the expectations, having more general neighbourhood contacts strengthened rather than weakened this effect for the native Dutch residents. Furthermore, having high number of neighbourhood contacts of another origin did not influence the relationship of ethnic diversity on general trust in neighbours. Therefore, policy makers must pay more attention to what types of contact might promote general trust in neighbours."

Attractiveness and time are deconstructed into three main concepts: leisure, work and living. Participants through Kantar Public’s panel all over the Netherlands aged 16 or older have been asked to fill in an online survey. Overall results done in various regression analyses demonstrate that leisure has the strongest effect on the NPS-score and the concept living also shows significant results.

The long-term bio-geomorphic development of foredune blowouts quantified from PlanetScope imagery and Airborne LiDAR data,"['Inzen, Eline van']","['Ruessink, Gerben']",2022-10-20T14:00:34Z,EN,['foredune blowouts; PlanetScope multispectral satellite imagery; LiDAR elevation data;landcover change; volumetric change; blowout development stage'],Earth Surface and Water,"Nowadays the Dutch coastal dune management is focussing more on ‘dynamic preservation’ of the foredunes whereby it is the objective to enhance dune biodiversity and elevate the hinterland to keep up with the sea level rise. A recent addition to this strategy is stimulating natural blowouts or digging man-made blowouts to increase the aeolian transport from the beach to the back dunes. However much is unknown about the long-term (bio)-geomorphic development of these foredune blowouts and their effectiveness on different timescales, annual and seasonal.
Here, the differences and similarities in morphological development between six different Dutch
blowout sites near Noordvoort, Egmond-Bergen, Bloemendaal, Schouwen and two on Terschelling, are
shown. A positive trend in sand area gain at the edges of the blowout with depositional lobe
expansions from the end of 2016 to the beginning of 2021 is seen for Schouwen (40.9%, ~20169
m2
/year), Egmond-Bergen (36.2%, ~3473m2
/year), Noordvoort (27.6%,~962m2
/year), Terschelling 2
(15.3%,~2729 m2
/year), Bloemendaal (15.0%,~4486 m2
/year) and Terschelling 1 (27.5% from 2019-
2021 ~8984m2
/year). Clear seasonal variations in sand area occurred around the edges of all six
blowouts with peaks of the highest and lowest sand areas at the beginning of the growing season and
at the end of the growing season which corresponds with the greenness cycle of vegetation. EgmondBergen (0.38x104 m3
/year), Bloemendaal (1x104 m3
/year) and Terschelling 2 (0.67x104 m3
/year)
showed an increase in cumulative sand volume and Noordvoort (~1.04x103 and ~0.77x103 m3
/year),
Schouwen (~2.2x104 and ~2.3x104 m3
/year) and Terschelling 1 (~1.75x104 and ~0.485x104 m3
/year)
showed an increase followed by a decrease in cumulative sand volume. Sand area changes were
determined since 2016 using 3x3m PlanetScope multispectral satellite imagery and volumetric changes
area were determined since 2012 using LiDAR airborne elevation data.
The morphological blowout development which consisted of a deepened and widened deflation basin
and a landwards expanded and migrated depositional lobe, assumed that all blowout sites were still in
the geomorphological stage following the conceptual model of Schwarz et. al. (2018). Overall, no
strong relation in size, age, man-made/natural or beach connection which might drive the sand area
or volume increment difference, was found by looking at these results.
However this study may be the starting point for a more defined comparison between the factors that
determine the obtained differences in the long-term (bio)-geomorphic blowout development. For
example, distribution of the height changes for several landcover changes may determine a deposition
threshold for a blowout stage transition. Furthermore, research on a considerable amount of different
blowouts with detailed sand budget computation involving an increased satellite resolution and
decreased time span, will be relevant."
A viewpoint-driven comparison of 3D vs 2D projections of high-dimensional data,"['Castelein, Wouter']","['Telea, Alex']",2022-10-20T00:01:00Z,EN,"['Dimensionality reduction, projections, data, analysis, high-dimensional data, 3D, versus, vs, 2D, viewpoint, driven, scatterplots, t-sne, tsne, visualization, normalized stress, shepard diagram correlation, continuity, trustworthiness, tool, histograms, parallel coordinates plot, pcp, view, patterns, user, evaluation, quantitative, qualitative']",Computing Science,"Dimensionality reduction is a popular data visualization technique that projects high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional space (2D or 3D) while preserving distance and/or neighborhood relations between points. The projected dataset can then be visualized in, for example, a scatterplot. This process greatly enhances interpretability of the dataset while minimizing information loss. While projections that target the 2D space have been studied in detail both quantitatively and qualitatively, 3D projections are far less well understood, with authors arguing both for and against the added value of a third visual dimension. More information can be stored in 3 dimensions, and point overlap in visualizations is reduced, but exploring and understanding a 3D projection adds complexity for users. A user can only ever see a 2D rendering of the 3D projection as seen from a certain viewpoint. In each view many points can be occluded, and therefore, in order to assess the entire projection, it is required to consider multiple views found by rotating it. Certain quality metrics can measure to what extent the structure of a dataset is preserved in a projection. But as of now, quantitative studies of 3D projections have disregarded this viewpoint limitation in 3D by using quality metrics that consider point neighborhoods and inter-point distances in 3D. We propose a different approach of measuring the quality of 3D projections, where we use quality metrics designed for 2D projections not on the entire 3D projection, but on multiple 2D views of a 3D projection. This tells us how the quality of a 3D projection changes as a function of the viewpoint, which we believe can give a better answer to the question of when and why 3D projections have added value over 2D projections from a user perspective. After a quantitative analysis of 30 3D projections we find that generally, most views of a 3D projection are of relatively high quality, with only a few considerably worse views. Therefore, users should not have trouble finding one of the better views. We furthermore find that, depending on the projection technique and chosen quality metric, many single views of a 3D projection can have higher quality than a 2D projection made with the same projection technique. We perform a user study to gain more insight in how users perceive the quality of single views of a 3D projection, and whether standard quality metrics can predict whether users will deem a view to be of good quality. Most importantly, we find that the strength of the correlation between measured quality of a viewpoint and user perceived quality depends on which dataset is projected. In some cases there appears to be no correlation at all. For projections where this correlation is strong, we observe an increased benefit of using a tool that suggests high quality viewpoints to users. In general, we find that in terms of user perceived quality, a 3D projection is just as good as or better than a 2D projection generated by the same projection technique. Furthermore, we find that users believe 3D projections to better display the dataset structure than their 2D counterpart."
"Equitable transformation, transforming equality: A grounded theory study on the role of equality and equity in research and policies for transformative change","[""O'Gara, Kayleigh""]","['Vervoort, Joost']",2022-10-20T00:01:02Z,EN,['transformations; sustainability transformations; transitions; transitions theory; grounded theory; equality; equity; innovation policy; technology and innovation; transformative innovation policy; governance'],Sustainable Development,"This study aimed to explore the role that equality and equity plays in transformations research, and how it can be integrated further by asking the research question: How are the issues of equality and equity incorporated into the Transformative Innovation Policy conceptual framework and practice, and what lessons can be derived from it?
Through working in collaboration with the Transformative Innovation Policy Consortium, data was collected on how researchers perceived and implemented equality and equity in their policy work. Utilizing the equality and equity framework developed by McDermott et al. (2013) and Leach et al. (2018) in studies of socio-ecological systems, the concepts were applied to TIP, and by extension TIP’s conceptual grounding, socio-technical systems (Geels, 2002). Through secondary data sources on policy experiments and interviews with researchers in TIPC, it was found that equality and equity was integral to TIP, although in an implicit manner through procedural mechanisms such as co-creation and mutual learning.
A full axial coding paradigm was created through the GT analysis, providing an abstracted, conceptual ‘map’ of the work of TIPC. This axial coding paradigm bridges the two conceptual frameworks, and presents an overarching description of the work of TIP practitioners. It was found that procedural equality was strongly emphasised already in the TIP framework, but recognitional equality played a barrier in interactions on both an individual level and a structural level. Distributional equality was framed as a distribution of knowledge resources, which highlighted the frictions between academics and on-the-ground practitioners. From the coding paradigm, certain values emphasised and strategies utilized by TIPC were emblematic of achieving equality: openness, capacity building, co-creation, consensus building, participation, network building, commitment to non-hierarchy, commitment to mutual learning and reflexivity, development of a shared narrative.
Beyond the framework used, the exploratory research identified a common thread which formed the ‘theory developed’ through the GT analysis: the underlying role of epistemic equality in transformations research. Relating to knowledge, who possesses the knowledge, and what knowledge is seen as legitimate, the role of epistemic (in)equality affected the interactions researchers had with practitioners based on their position within the Global North-South divide. Recommendations based on these findings include implementing guiding principles to examine the role of epistemic equality within deliberative methods such as co-creation, and continuing to foster reflexive practices within the research community and while engaging with practitioners and stakeholders."

Research has shown that nowadays music is perceived mainly in the background accompanying other activities. Many streaming users therefore create playlists to have songs readily available for those different scenarios. This study aims to determine how users of those platforms create their playlists.
An online survey was used to get quantitative data on the opinions of a vast amount of users, mainly in their 20s, on playlist creation. Informed by this, user tests were conducted with 8 participants to get qualitative insights into the process itself. Analysis of both methods revealed that people indeed use various different strategies to create their playlists. Based on those, four overarching user types, two sub-types and other behavioural patterns could be derived. Interpreting the characteristics of those revealed that the difference in desired level of control, song recommendation usage and song familiarity preference are important factors to be recognized.
Through those findings, design implications for music streaming platforms could be given to enhance the experience and intuitiveness of the playlist creation process. Providing the user with more control while adding songs and incorporating context information into song recommendations would significantly improve this task. Further research is needed to support the connection of the user types to different personality traits and understand long-term playlist curation."

"To the standard model and beyond, A theoretical and experimental study of Leptoquark phenomenology and its traces in LFV $B \rightarrow \tau\mu$ decays in theory and with LHCb","['Massen, Olaf']","['Snellings, R.J.M.']",2022-10-20T00:00:55Z,EN,"['BSM Physics, Leptoquarks, Phenomenology, Lepton flavour violation, LHCb']",Experimental Physics,"In recent years a number of experimental measurements in the field of flavour physics have showed hints towards a source of physics beyond the Standard Model. Theoretical studies have been performed to understand how new physics could account for these measured deviations from the SM. One of the proposed solutions is the existence of leptoquarks, particles coupling quarks and leptons directly. These leptoquarks will inevitably lead to new phenomenology such as lepton flavour violating decays. In this thesis leptoquarks are studied from a theoretical and experimental point of view. In the theoretical studies a high energy theory producing vector leptoquarks at low energy, the 4321-model, is studied in detail and its contributions to the lepton flavour violating $B_{(s)}\rightarrow \tau \mu$ decay are considered. This is followed by the study of a minimal BSM explanation of the flavour anomalies. A $\chi^2$-fit of the parameters of this minimal explanation to the flavour anomalies is performed and it is shown that this minimal model describes the experimental data better than the Standard Model, with a $\Delta \chi^2 = 68.88$ with respect to the Standard Model. Experimentally, the lepton flavour violating decay of $B_{(s)}\rightarrow(\tau\rightarrow \pi\pi\pi\nu_{\tau})\mu$ is studied with the LHCb experiment. First an HLT2 trigger line for this decay is written, to be used in the next data taking run of LHCb. Next a start was made with the search for the $B_{(s)}\rightarrow\tau\mu$ decay in Run 2 data. Potential $\Lambda_b$-baryon backgrounds were studied with RapidSim, an analytic reconstruction of the missing neutrino momentum was performed and a fit was performed on the invariant mass distribution of the $B^{0}\rightarrow D^{-} (\rightarrow K^+\pi^-\pi^-)\pi^+$ normalisation channel. This work shows how in theory leptoquark models can account for the flavour anomalies and give contributions to lepton flavour violating $B$-meson decays. Experimentally this work forms a basis for both the search for $B_{(s)}\rightarrow(\tau\rightarrow \pi\pi\pi\nu_{\tau})\mu$ in Run 2 data as well as for the search in future data runs like Run 3 of the LHCb experiment."
Explainable Online Reinforcement Learning Using Abstract Argumentation,"['Otero Moreira, Cándido']","['Bex, F.J.']",2022-10-21T00:00:41Z,EN,['reinforcement learning; abstract argumentation; explainability;'],Artificial Intelligence,"The democratisation of deep learning (DL) in recent years has led to an increasing presence of DL algorithms influencing our everyday lives, from recommending us our next book to deciding whether we are granted a loan or not. Although DL has allowed for a major performance boost in data-driven applications, the decisions made by neural networks are completely opaque to humans, rendering their suitability questionable for applications where the model needs to be verifiable and/or explanations must be completely faithful to the model. Related literature exists that tries to overcome this problem by using model extraction to derive an (approximately) equivalent symbolic model using a value-based argumentation framework (VAF) as its inference engine. While the resulting model has the advantage of being verifiable and providing faithful explanations, model extraction imposes an exploration boundary on the symbolic model. This thesis proposes a novel approach that integrates formal argumentation in an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. The benefit of this method is that the model can be trained using online RL instead of using a surrogate model, leading to a potentially better solution while still using a VAF as its inference engine."
A Single-Cell Approach To Gene Regulatory Network Analysis of The Human Cornea,"['Arts, Julian']","['Ridder, Jeroen']",2022-10-21T00:00:39Z,EN,['Bioinformatics; single-cell epigenomics; cornea; data integration; gene regulatory networks'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"The outmost layer of the cornea, the corneal epithelium, is maintained by stem cells
in the limbus called limbal stem cells. Cells in the cornea shift their cell type in a process called
stratification. For cells involved in corneal stratication, it is vital to maintain the proper cell fate.
Transcription factors (TFs) driving gene regulatory networks (GRNs) determine proper cell fate
determination. Thus, determining which TFs drive cell fate determination in corneal cell types is
necessary to get insights into corneal stratification. Here we combine data from the publicly
available human corneal atlas. We show that a combination of single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell
ATAC-seq can be used for determining gene regulatory networks. Motif analysis on single-cell
ATAC-seq data after integration reveals a division of cell populations into stromal or epithelial cell
fates. Moreover, we reveal TFs involved in driving corneal cell identity when we analyze gene
regulatory networks of cell type clusters. Most importantly, KLF5, EHF, GRHL1 and ELF3 drive
epithelial cell identity. We also show that limbal neural crest derived progenitor cells are separate
from corneal, limbal and conjunctival cell clusters. Cell-cell interaction analysis demonstrates that
this cell population could modulate the immune cells. Thus, we provide insights in corneal
stratification by predicting which TFs are important for driving cell fate determination of cells in
the human cornea."
The Impact of Virtual Reality on Social Processes in Escape Rooms,"['Blecourt, Mark de']","['Hauptmann, Hanna']",2022-10-20T00:01:06Z,EN,[],Business Informatics,"Educational escape rooms have been used for a while, but almost all require the players to be in the same room. This is still true when looking at most digital escape rooms. A way to have people experience the same escape room while being physically distant, is through Virtual Reality. One of the most important aspects of an escape room is the social processes that take place, especially the ability of the players to collaborate. A VR escape room has been created and tested by three groups of participants. Data was gathered through observation, a questionnaire and a guided interview. Results indicate that VR has both a positive and negative impact on collaboration, and especially on communication. Whether the impact is positive or negative is largely dependent on the amount of experience a player has. Negative effects can therefore be reduced when interactions within the escape room are more natural."

Vitality refers to a sense of aliveness and energy, indicative of mental and physical strength. This research also investigates the mediating role of harmonious work passion and the moderating role of obsessive work passion in the relationship between task autonomy and employee vitality. Enhanced knowledge about what factors will increase the vitality experienced by employees is crucial in strengthening overall levels of well-being. The theory of self-determination and the dualistic model of passion are used as theoretical bases in describing the proposed relationships in this study. It was hypothesised that task autonomy would positively influence employee vitality, harmonious work passion would positively mediate this relationship, and obsessive work passion would negatively moderate this relationship. The sample consisted of 145 part-time or full-time employees (N = 145) who completed an online survey regarding their experiences and behaviours at work. Analyses were conducted at a significance level of p < .05. The results of this study showed that task autonomy did indeed positively influence employee vitality, but this relationship was fully mediated by harmonious work passion. Obsessive work passion was not found to significantly influence the relationship between task autonomy and employee vitality. As such, the moderated mediation model was found to be statistically significant only through the influence of harmonious work passion. These findings reveal the powerful influence that harmonious passion has when combined with high levels of task autonomy to promote feelings of vitality amongst employees. This has implications in the field of positive psychology, as enhancing levels of vitality in the workplace contributes highly to increased well-being and overall quality of life."

How philanthropic foundations act as field-builders influencing justice discourses in land conservation,"['Hübsch, Sarah']","['Kalfagianni, Agni']",2022-07-21T00:01:16Z,EN,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Introduction: 
Through their increasingly influential and financially powerful role within the field of conservation
governance, philanthropic foundations act as field-builders, directing the fields’ creation and structure.
Thereby, the foundations’ interpretations of how to perceive justice issues affects who is considered
when addressing injustices and what is aimed for when striving for justice within the field. This research
assesses the understudied role of philanthropic foundations functioning as field-builders and thereby
influencing justice discourses in the conservation governance field.

Theoretical Framework:
This thesis builds on the pluralistic justice framework of Biermann & Kalfagianni (2020) and extends it
with an eco-centric perspective to assess the foundations’ justice views. To evaluate their field-building
role, this research examines the foundations’ collaborative activities to build a field. Further, countries
in which the foundations fund conservation activities are identified to find out in which geographical
locations the foundations extend the field of conservation governance.

Methodology:
By following a qualitative comparative research approach, 12 foundations contributing largely to
‘Sustainable Development Goal 15 – Life on Land’ were studied. The data was collected through website
information of the foundations and interviews with eight conservation program representatives of six
foundations. A discourse analysis was applied to analyse the data regarding underlying justice
interpretations.

Results:
Focused justice issues by the foundations are the protection of basic needs and rights for Indigenous
and local communities combined with increased representation of marginalised groups in decision-makings.
The foundations mainly collaborate with non-profit organisations as grant receivers to build
the field of conservation governance. Throughout these grantee partnerships, the foundations apply
different participatory approaches whereby perspectives of people affected by injustices are aimed to
be engaged in the field. Most foundations fund initiatives in their origin country, the U.S. and in
countries in the Global South.

Discussion/ Conclusion:
The findings reveal that foundations as field-builders promote specific complementary combinations of
human-centred justice views. The foundations’ build the field by involving partners and people affected
by injustices into the field according to the foundations’ interpretations of justice. Thereby, foundations
maintain the field-building power, particularly by funding financially weaker countries in the Global
South.

In conclusion, the role of philanthropic foundations is most relevant in regards of justice norm
developments in the conservation governance field. By critically reflecting on their own interpretations
and approaches, more awareness can be brought to these issues to shift field-building power to people
affected by injustices."

Materials and methods: In this study patients who received dorsal stabilisation using a screw and rod system on the lumbar or sacral spine were included. For each patient an MRI was performed, including an isotropic 3D T1 MR, and synthetic CT images were reconstructed from a T1-weighted multiple gradient-echo scan using the BoneMRI software. Surgical planning of the screws was performed. BoneMRI was evaluated by three observers, through a questionnaire and with results following a likert scale, on the visualisation of anatomical structures, the confidence during preoperative planning and the added value during planning. The obtained scores were examined by means of a contingency table; the interrater reliability was examined with the intraclass correlation coefficient; and statistical tests were calculated to study the possibility of correlation between different variables.
Results and Discussion: 24 patients were included in the study and in total 110 screws were placed in the lumbar and S1 vertebrae. BoneMRI showed adequate visualisation of anatomical regions in 90% of all scored vertebrae and good to excellent interrater reliability between the three observers was found (ICC: 0.85 to 0.96). BoneMRI showed to be capable to perform screw planning with confidence, was capable to visualise pathologies and showed to be an added value compared to the isotropic 3D T1 MR scan.
Conclusion: BoneMRI produces adequate qualitative image quality and showed an added value for surgical planning in the spine."

To ensure safe storage and disposal, geological information of a salt formation is required. Its thickness, geographic distribution, depth and tectonic history must be understood to predict its likelihood to become affected by future geological processes. Geological information about the salt layer of the Triassic Röt Formation is limited and therefore it is unclear if this Main Röt Evaporite Member is suitable for either temporary storage or permanent disposal.
Distribution, isopach, and depth maps of the Main Röt Evaporite Member in the subsurface below Enschede using 2D and 3D seismic and well log data are presented. These maps have been evaluated in relation to the tectonic evolution of the area to improve the understanding of the geological development of the unit.
The thickness of the Main Röt Evaporite Member in the study area ranges between 10 and 130 m, and the depth of the top is between 300 and 1500 m. This distribution is controlled by Triassic extension and subsequent Cretaceous inversion. The depositional environment of the Main Röt Evaporite Member is a sabkha with salt pans with episodic marine incursions. Due to insufficient thickness, only in a small part of the study area, the member is potentially suitable for storage/disposal. However, based on other storage and disposal concepts, this area is not reliable for storage/disposal of gas, oil, and (radioactive) waste."

The competences can be divided into five orientations; veterinary capabilities; professional commitment; effective relationships; psychological resources; self-awareness. Expected was that the higher the score on the competences within every orientation, the greater the perceived PJ fit. In addition, passion is added as a moderator to the relationship of the competences – and the orientations of the competences – and PJ fit. Self-reports of 54 students from various universities and origin were gathered with an online survey shared by e-mail and other social media platforms. A cross-sectional study design was used. Results showed only a positive statistically significant effect (p < .05) for the relationship between the competences and PJ fit. When passion was added as moderator, no statistically significant results were found (p = .05). No positive statistically significant effect (p > .05) was found for the relationship between each orientation of the competences and PJ fit, nor for these relationships and passion as moderator (p > .05). Passion seems to be a better predictor for PJ fit than competences. Further research should investigate the construct used in this study and their unique variance. Finding the best predictor for PJ fit could decrease the dropout of young equine veterinarians experienced by Altano Gruppe."
Local scale hydrodynamics and oxygen fluctuations near coral reefs,"['Holzhauser, Caitlin']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-07-22T00:00:50Z,EN,[],Marine Sciences,"Coral reefs are a vital part of Curaçao’s economy, providing revenue from ecotourism and fisheries, as well as providing shoreline protection. A vital coral species, Diploria strigosa, is a major reef-building species around the island, and contributes enormously to the health of the reefs, making it a prime candidate for this project. Physical oceanic processes, such as waves and currents, influence the health of these corals by introducing oxygen-rich water through mixing of the water column. In order to understand more about the growth and vitality of coral around Curaçao, it is therefore critical to understand how these processes influence the movement of oxygen around coral reefs.
This thesis set out to collect field data to investigate the existence of a relationship between hydrodynamics and dissolved oxygen near coral reefs around the island of Curaçao, as part of a larger project, the SEALINK project. SEALINK, part of the Dutch Research Council (NWO)’s Caribbean Research program, is an interdisciplinary research initiative to assess the impact of land-based and water-borne substances on the coral reefs of the Dutch Caribbean. Through a fieldwork campaign, dissolved oxygen concentration, wave data, and current velocity data was collected from seven study sites on the southern coast of Curaçao. Acoustic Doppler current profilers (AD2CP) and oxygen loggers were deployed through diving, and left on the seafloor to measure for six hours. A statistical analysis was run to test the validity of using current velocities as a predictor for dissolved oxygen values. Finally, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was created using the fieldwork data in order to assist in the understanding of processes that influence dissolved oxygen around coral reefs. The results from fieldwork show that the extent of the relationship between waves, currents, and dissolved oxygen depends greatly on the location and tidal cycle. Study sites closer to the eastern point of the island showed that velocity and dissolved oxygen are connected, and that velocity has a greater capacity to predict dissolved oxygen values. The CFD model assists in a deeper comprehension of the influence of flow and other processes that can impact dissolved oxygen fluctuations around coral reefs."
How can demographically diverse employees become friends?,"['Foka, Eleftheria']","['Vink, Melissa']",2022-07-22T00:00:41Z,EN,"['diverse workplace friendship, transformational leadership, inclusive climate']","Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","This research aimed to investigate how organizations can facilitate friendships among demographically diverse employees in the workplace. Such friendships can offer multiple benefits to employees and organizations and allow effective diversity management within the workplace. We hypothesized that transformational leadership would have a positive effect on diverse friendship formation through the creation of an inclusive climate. We collected survey data among 227 employees working in different organizations worldwide. Our results indicated that the perception of having a transformational leader could indeed facilitate friendship formation among diverse employees. More than this, we showed that the perception of working in an inclusive climate explains why employees who perceive their leader as transformational report more diverse workplace friendships. The present study demonstrates the importance of transformational leadership style and inclusive climate in helping organizations and employees navigate diverse organizations and reap both the benefits of friendship and those of diversity."
"Succesfactoren voor het tweetalig primair onderwijs: een kwantitatief onderzoek naar de invloed van ervaring met een nieuw onderwijssysteem en leerling-, leerkracht- en onderwijsfactoren op de leerprestaties op het tweetalig primair onderwijs","['Stuij, Emmi']","['Pinget, Anne-France']",2022-07-23T00:01:14Z,NL,[],Meertaligheid en taalverwerving,"Sinds 2014 wordt er in Nederland op een aantal basisscholen geëxperimenteerd met tweetalig onderwijs (tpo), waarbij 30 tot 50% van de onderwijstijd het Engels als instructietaal wordt gehanteerd. Om de kwaliteit van dit onderwijs te kunnen verbeteren, is het van belang om in kaart te brengen welke factoren invloed hebben op de leerprestaties van leerlingen. Ook is het, vanwege het gebrek aan literatuur hierover, interessant om na te gaan of meer ervaring met de implementatie van een nieuw onderwijssysteem leidt tot betere leerprestaties. In dit onderzoek zijn deze vragen onderzocht door de Engelse lees- en luistervaardigheid van 361 leerlingen van zes verschillende tpo-scholen te analyseren. Ten eerste is gekeken of er een verschil in leerprestaties is waar te nemen tussen de allereerste lichting tpo-leerlingen en de tweede lichting. Dit bleek niet het geval te zijn: in dit onderzoek is dus geen bewijs aangetroffen dat meer ervaring met de toepassing van een onderwijssysteem leidt tot hogere leerprestaties. Ten slotte is de invloed van een aantal leerling-, leerkracht- en onderwijskenmerken onderzocht. Het geslacht en de leeftijd van de leerling bleken niet van significante invloed te zijn op de leerprestaties. De simultane meertaligheid en thuistalen van de leerling, de leservaring van de leerkracht in jaren, het percentage onderwijstijd in het Engels en de onderwijsmethode die wordt toegepast om het tweetalig onderwijs vorm te geven bleken allen wel een significante invloed uit te oefenen op de lees- en/of luistervaardigheid van de tpo-leerlingen. Met name de leservaring van de leerkracht en het percentage onderwijstijd lijken belangrijke voorwaarden te zijn voor kwalitatief goed tweetalig onderwijs. Dit onderzoek heeft hiermee bijgedragen aan het creëren van inzicht in factoren die van belang zijn voor succesvol tweetalig onderwijs."
"Hendrik Chabot in Rotterdam, Vrouwenpolder en Bergschenhoek: maatschappelijke en persoonlijke factoren in zijn werk","['Oosterhuis, Simon']","['Veneman-Boersma, Linda']",2022-07-23T00:01:21Z,NL,['Chabot; Expressionisme; Interbellum; Rotterdam; Vrouwenpolder; Bergschenhoek; Zeeland; Visvrouw; Zeeuwse Boerin; Vervolgden; Bezetting; Tweede Wereldoorlog; Entartete Kunst; Ontaarde Kunst; Agrarisch Romanticisme; Socialisme; Communisme'],Kunstgeschiedenis,"In deze scriptie is onderzocht welke rol maatschappelijke en persoonlijke factoren speelden in het werk van Hendrik Chabot (1896-1949). Om die vraag te beantwoorden is gebruik gemaakt van secundaire bronnen en van primaire bronnen zoals brieven van en aan Chabot en recensies die destijds in kranten en tijdschriften te lezen waren over zijn werk. 
Uit het onderzoek is gebleken dat Chabots vroege werk, door zijn achtergrond als Rotterdamse arbeidersjongen, een linkse, maatschappijkritische lading had. Nadat hij als kunstenaar bekendheid verwierf ontstond in zijn werk een distantie ten opzichte van zijn onderwerpen uit de arbeidersklasse, zoals in het werk Visvrouw uit 1932.
In zijn Zeeuwse periode in 1933 schildert hij de boerenbevolking op dezelfde wat afstandelijke manier, waarbij romantisering van het leven op het platteland wordt gepaard aan de erkenning van het zware boerenbestaan. Hiervan is Zeeuwse Boerin uit 1933 een voorbeeld.
Chabot werkt tijdens de bezetting door, in weerwil van de nationaalsocialistische pers die hem als doelwit neemt. Hij schildert in die periode in Bergschenhoek de slachtoffers van de oorlog, zoals De Vervolgden uit 1944. Bij dit werk is geen sprake meer van romantisering maar enkel van medeleven met de vervolgde mens. 
Concluderend kan dus worden gesteld dat maatschappelijke en persoonlijke factoren er toe hebben geleid dat er in het werk van Chabot een ontwikkeling te zien is van maatschappijkritiek naar distantie in zijn Rotterdamse periode, en van romantisering in zijn Zeeuwse periode naar mededogen tijdens de bezetting."
Van woorden naar daden,"['Duren, Fleur van']","['Vartija, Devin']",2022-07-23T00:01:23Z,EN,['Feminist discourse; new feminism; pre-war feminism; feminist consciousness; literature; interbellum; Virginia Woolf'],Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,In het wetenschappelijke debat omtrent de invloed van literatuur op het feministische discours ligt de focus voornamelijk op het Victoriaanse tijdperk waarin New Woman Fiction opkwam. Deze literaire stroming bekritiseerde het ideaalbeeld van de Victoriaanse vrouw en oefende hiermee veel invloed uit op het feministische discours. In het interbellum verschuift de focus van het wetenschappelijke debat echter naar de herdefiniëring van de feministische identiteit. Het dominante feministische discours bestaat uit twee stromingen: het vooroorlogse feminisme en het nieuwe feminisme. De invloed van literatuur op het heersende feministische discours wordt echter volledig buiten beschouwing gelaten. Om dit gat in het wetenschappelijke debat op te vullen is een verdiepend historisch onderzoek uitgevoerd om de volgende onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden: Wat was de invloed van het werk van Virginia Woolf binnen het feministische discours tijdens het interbellum in Engeland? Om deze onderzoeksvraag zo gedegen mogelijk te beantwoorden is ten eerste – aan de hand van de Feministische Kritische Discours Analyse – gekeken naar het feministische discours in de essays A Room of One’s Own en Three Guineas. Er kwam uit de analyse duidelijk naar voren dat beide essays zich voornamelijk bewegen binnen het vooroorlogse feministische discours. Om vervolgens de invloed van beide essays op het heersende feministische discours in het interbellum inzichtelijk te maken is een analyse van schriftelijke lezersreacties op beide essays uitgevoerd. Aan de hand van deze analyse is geconcludeerd dat beide essays een grote invloed hadden op het heersende feministische discours in het interbellum omdat zij in staat waren een feministisch bewustzijn op te wekken bij de lezer. Waarbij de lezer zich niet alleen bewust werd gemaakt van de eigen – onderdrukte – positie maar ook werd aangezet tot actie.
Framing Meat & Masculinities - Jet De Ligny,"['Ligny, Jet de']","['Korte, Anne-Marie']",2022-07-23T00:00:59Z,EN,"['Meat, masculinity, food, television, representation, gender, hegemony']",Gender Studies,"The idea that ‘real’ men need meat because it contributes to strength, power and virility is deeply ingrained in Western cultures, including the Dutch. This dominant view can be seen as an element that is inextricably linked to the model of hegemonic masculinity. It perpetuates power relations, which are harmful to humans, the environment and animals. Given the fact that meat consumption among Dutch men is still high, this thesis critically examines the extent to which Dutch television advertisements for meat products reflect the image of meat as a symbol of hegemonic masculinity. Through a juxtaposition with advertisements for plant-based meat analogues, it becomes clear how the current dominant representation in meat advertisements paints an image of meat that is associated with masculinity, male dominance and power relations. This thesis contributes to the existing field of research on gendered food by focusing on the framing of meat consumption through the lens of television texts. More research on food advertisements and their relation to hegemonic representations of food is recommended, as well as that criticism of and action against the provocative role of advertising – both in the academic and regulatory field – in the construction and maintenance of gender inequality also pays attention to gender stereotyped representation in the context of food promotion."

Martens is een man van en in de marge; geen groot schrijver en ook het werk dat hij maakt is niet opzichtig. Enerzijds is dit zijn karakter: bescheiden en dankbaar, anderzijds komt dit door het uitblijven van publicaties waarin hij het vak kritisch onder de loep neemt en zijn collega’s en het publiek eraan herinnert wat de rol van de grafisch ontwerper volgens hem inhoudt. Het is hierdoor dat de invulling van zijn modernistische positie vaak oppervlakkig is beschreven. Binnen het grafisch ontwerp discours bekleedt het modernisme een prominente rol. Het vak heeft zich in Nederland gevormd met het vooroorlogse modernisme van De Stijl en de Zwitserse internationale stijl die als norm werd aangenomen na de oorlog. Een eenduidige definitie van het modernisme lijkt echter onmogelijk vast te stellen, het loopt uiteen van stijl en aanpak tot de relatie tussen kunst en commercie. Ondanks deze pluriformiteit werd het modernisme ook een monolithisch concept waartegen ontwerpers en critici door de jaren heen ageerden. Het gevolg hiervan is een rijk maar complex geheel van tegengestelde stellingnames en posities die samen het grafisch ontwerp landschap vormgeven. Door onderzoek te doen naar de houding van Martens ten opzichte van de verschillende ontwikkelingen en uitgangspunten binnen het modernisme, vergelijkingen te maken met tijdgenoten en daarnaast diverse ontwerpen te analyseren op modernistische kenmerken, wordt getracht de volgende vraag te beantwoorden: Welke modernistische positie heeft Karel Martens binnen het Nederlandse grafisch ontwerp landschap? Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat Martens’ modernistische positie niet in steen staat gebeiteld maar dat hij een speelse omgang heeft met het concept. Op enige afstand van de uitgesproken modernisten reflecteert Martens kritisch op de ontwikkelingen waarna hij hierop reageert met experimenten die zich inhoudelijk engageren en voortkomen uit het plezier van het maken."

As the Russian government is increasingly reluctant in its attempts to solve this, especially when paired with international interference, Russian NGOs focused on women’s rights have had to reach out to other resources in their attempts to secure women from gender-based violence. This thesis contributes to the debates on the role of NGOs in such ventures and on the circumstances in which this happens by researching how and in which domestic and international contexts Russian NGOs have tried to securitise women from gender-based violence on a domestic and international level between 2000-2020. Using securitisation theory as a framework, the thesis analyses the domestic context, international resources, and securitising moves of several NGOs. It finds that NGOs have had to deal with the growing emphasis of the Russian state on traditional values, diminishing the urgency of the issue. By reaching out to foreign media and international organisations, the NGOs have tried to convince a variety of audiences of the danger of gender-based violence."
An analysis of how fringe platform Gab.com relates to the process of platformization,"['Wilde de Ligny, Sofie de']","['Schie, Gerwin van']",2022-07-23T00:01:13Z,EN,"['Gab, Fringe platform, platformization, API, platform ecosystem, infrastructures']",New Media and Digital Culture,"This study analyzes how we can understand the development of fringe platforms in relation to the process of platformization. Platformization refers to the dynamic between platforms rather than a platform as an object. This dynamic happens in a platform ecosystem, representing a corporate space in the Western hemisphere dominated most notably by the Big Five tech companies. Fringe platform Gab.com opposes this dynamic and strives for independence. Multiple authors have investigated the concept of platformization in recent years. Since these authors have focused on mainstream or regular platforms, it is currently unknown how fringe platforms such as Gab relate to the process of platformization. This study bridges this gap by conducting a Platform Infrastructure Analysis. Based on the institutional and technological analysis, this study reveals the
theoretical implications of the concept of platformization, as it appears that fringe platforms do not belong within the characterization of the theoretical understanding of the concept. Despite these theoretical implications, this study identifies that despite the desire of Gab to be separated from the Big five tech companies, the mainstream and fringe platforms will still be part of the same online dynamic in the platform ecosystem. Furthermore, following the technological development of Gab, I claim that Gab is slowly but surely penetrating the roots of digital infrastructures. Further research is needed to update and broaden the theoretical understanding of platformization because the theory is not comprehensive at this point."

Simultaneously, however, motherhood was profoundly idealized and propagandized in Dutch public debate during that period. The aim of this thesis was to examine whether childless women, for not fulfilling their ‘reproductive destiny’, were represented as being inferior to mothers in Dutch public debate between 1880 and 1960. I decided to use a method of cultural historical psychoanalysis to answer that research question. For a complicated phenomenon like childlessness, it is crucial to take into consideration the subject position, of in this case childless women and mothers, and the way in which subjects are shaped and formed by sociocultural, biological, and psychological structures. By studying the in-text signs of resistance, silence, and transference, psychoanalysis was used to analyze the subconscious structures that influenced the binary opposition between mothers and childless women. 

The sources that were studied – newspaper and magazine articles – represent the different aspects of childlessness in a significantly negative manner. Psychoanalysis showed that childless women were generally represented as the lesser, lacking ‘other’, since they could not answer what most people considered to be the ‘highest natural calling’ of women: motherhood. This resulted in childless women being portrayed as, for example, lonely, bitter, foolish, lazy, and jealous. I argue that the negative framing of childless women, as inferior to mothers, is a sign of both repressed frustrations and a partially subconscious practice of identity reinforcement. The fact that some women were challenging that status quo by not fulfilling their gender’s ‘destiny’ (both voluntarily and involuntarily), roused resistance in the patriarchal public debate. It is also an example of Freud’s narcissism of minor differences, that explains how the biological distinction between men and women served as a basis on which men could reinforce their group identity as opposed to women, and on which mothers could reinforce their identity as opposed to childless women."
Beyond Textuality and Back: Gurinder Chadha’s Literary Adaptation Bride & Prejudice as a Product of The Adaptation Industry,"['Cramer, Isabel']","['Bijl, Paul']",2022-07-23T00:03:16Z,EN,['Adaptation; Adaptation Studies; Adaptation Industry; Literary Adaptation; Literary Studies; Textuality; Extratextual; Jane Austen; Gurinder Chadha; Audiences'],Literatuur vandaag,"“Beyond Textuality and Back: Gurinder Chadha’s Literary Adaptation Bride & 
Prejudice as a Product of The Adaptation Industry” considers how the Adaptation Industry and an audience-focused approach to Bride & Prejudice can function as a necessary complement to the existing, text-focused academic debate, and proposes an alternative way of engaging with objects such as adaptations and literary works. By going beyond textuality and interacting with the academically underrepresented Adaptation Industry, one can uncover how the institutional actors influence and shape the textual form an adaptation takes. This approach helps give depth to the popular existing text-focused research while at the same time providing an extra layer of depth by acknowledging the extratextual presence of the influential, yet largely overlooked, actors within the Adaptation Industry. With the help of this theory, as constructed by Simone Murray, one will be able to better understand how an adaptation is the product of  complex sociology of adaptation that leaves nothing to chance. This thesis takes Murray’s theory a step further by engaging with the audience reactions to the influence of the Adaptation Industry as reflected in the adaptation. Even more so, this thesis analyzes the contradicting extratextual ideal audience versus the actual audience. It is important to include the audience reactions to the Adaptation Industry as reflected in Bride & Prejudice in this research, as the academic debate rarely mentions its presence, much less critically engages with it. 
With clear structure, this thesis project will address the perfectly valid existing 
text-focused research on Bride & Prejudice, while functioning as a demonstration as to how the Adaptation Industry and an audience-focused approach to Bride & Prejudice can function as a necessary complement to the existing academic debate. This will firstly be done by engaging with the influence of the director as the “author” that shapes Bride & Prejudice as a literary adaptation. After all, a film’s final product and perception are influenced by the persona, background and media image of the director as well as the classificatory genre and ideal audience she has appointed the production. Secondly, this thesis will draw from the industrial side of the Adaptation Industry in the shape of Miramax, Bend It Films and the UK Film Council. This analysis of influencing factors such as the seasonal calendar, institutional hierarchies, convergence, as well as funding and marketing will help one can better understand how, where and when the audience is presented with a specific literary adaptation. Lastly, this thesis will demonstrate the difference between the ideal audience and the real audience of Bride & Prejudice, as well as how the presence of the Adaptation Industry actors has been received and reflected on by the viewers. These critical global audience reviews on Bride & Prejudice reflect how extratextual factors from the Adaptation Industry such as genre, the director’s background and the producing institutions can alter an individual’s understanding of the film, and help them develop more critical interpretations.
Rather than ignoring the extratextual dimension of a literary adaptation, adaptation 
and literary scholars are enabled to create a more balanced analysis without ignoring the textual dimension. This will ensure a more rounded out, balanced way of conducting research, where a textual approach is no longer put on a pedestal, but rather put on a balancing scale alongside an extratextual approach."

It is expected that robots need to increasingly make trade-off decisions, sometimes trading an individual militant’s safety for a mission’s objective. This can have a negative impact on human trust towards a robot team member. This study tested different moral intentions behind harmful decision-making. Participants formed a team with a virtual partner, either human or robot, to finish two missions. Halfway in the missions, a harmful decision was made whereafter two declarations of the partner revealed different intentions for this decision, both aimed at restoring trust. The declarations exposed that the harmful decision was either based on utilitarianist or deontologist considerations and revealed the partner’s lack of respectively benevolence and competence. Participant’s trust was measured prior to violation, after violation and after the reveal of the different intentions. It was found that there was no difference in trust development between partner types. Participant’s competence-based trust dropped the most after violation. Trust after a competence-based trust violation was found to be more easily restored than after a benevolence-based trust violation. This suggests that in all teams, benevolence-based trust is the least easily restored after a benevolence-based trust violation. It is recommended to be careful in being transparent about utilitarianist decision-making. Suggestions for future research are focused on the examination of the best trust repair technique, possibly through investigating the alignment of human moral expectations and their robot partner’s decision-making. An additional note that contradicts previous studies is that – although errorless design is crucial in safety-critical industries – humans can forgive their robot team member after they make a mistake."

The broad use of face masks in the healthcare sector, however, complicates the transmission of non-verbal cues. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies showed early evidence that interpreting emotional expressions was done less accurate when the expressor wore a mask. However, compared to the vast amount of research considering face masks’ effectivity in reducing virus transmission, the number of studies regarding these communicative consequences pales into insignificance. More research is thus found to be necessary to be able to make a well-informed decision on whether wearing a mask is valuable. This study builds on the existing studies on the latter topic and takes a step towards quantifying the effect of face masks on the interpretation of non-verbal emotional communication. It does so by controlling for mask appearance, testing the influences of race and comparing effects of masks on distinguishing emotion valences with the same effects of showing only the upper face half. Results confirmed the negative effect of face masks on emotion recognition as seen in earlier studies. This effect was found to be similar to the effect of half faces, stressing its magnitude and implying that mask-wearing faces are encoded purely through the facial features in the upper face half. For Asian faces in particular, the effect of face masks was strongest. As people of Asian ethnicity are suggested to show lower intensity facial expressions, it is implied that high intensity emotion display in the facial features in the upper face half is important for nuancing masks’ negative effect on emotional communication. In conclusion, limitations of this study and its implications for the healthcare sector are discussed."

to the pursuit of couples therapy among a Dutch sample. In two studies, the barriers 
surrounding couples therapy were examined. In Study 1, the sample existed of distressed 
individuals who were not in couples therapy (N = 462). Attitudinal barriers (such as: the 
feeling that therapy is unnecessary, the feeling of own responsibility for solving relationship 
problems and a lack of trust in effectiveness of couples therapy) were of most importance, 
regardless of sex. In Study 2, the sample existed of individuals who were in couples therapy
(N = 118). The top three barriers here differed between sex. For men, the feeling of own 
responsibility for solving relationship problems, unfamiliarity with couples therapy and the 
feeling of embarrassment were most important. For women, costs, the feeling of own 
responsibility for solving relationship problems and the partner’s negative opinion about 
couples therapy were most important. Moreover, a correlation analysis revealed that 
evaluation of couples therapy correlated with the attitudinal barrier: no trust in effectiveness 
for women only. A lower trust in effectiveness was associated with a lower evaluation of 
couples therapy. This indicates barriers of importance differ between those in pursuit of 
therapy and those already in therapy and between sexes. Findings are important to future 
interventions."

economic history. After decades of decline, this program led to newfound economic growth,
with the help of the IMF and the World Bank. The program is both praised for its success in
starting growth and criticized for its focus on macroeconomic factors and keeping the
Ghanaian economy reliant on cocoa exports. This thesis seeks to add to this literature by
including a colonial perspective and analyzing the influence of colonial cocoa policies on the
ERP. In order to do so, the institutional theory developed by Masahiko Aoki is used to
research the mechanisms determining the success of policy changes in the cocoa industry.
Applying this framework to the policies from colonial reports on the Gold Coast, as well as
the ERP have revealed both similarities and differences. The ERP aimed to change back to a
liberalized cocoa industry, which shared similarities with the early colonial period. The ERP
did incorporate elements of the later colonial institutions and postcolonial institutions,
although their function changed with the mandates being abolished. Also, more specific types
of policies from the colonial era are featured in the ERP in some way. These are specifically
institutions related to providing farmers with knowledge on farming methods and
infrastructure. The ERP thus shares some striking similarities with both early and late
colonial institutions, showing the strong links over time in the process of economic recovery."

Since animal experiments are justified on the basis of their expected benefits, translational failures represent an epistemic but also a normative problem. The purpose of this thesis is to address both problems by exploring the role of epistemic virtues in avoiding failures that can be reconducted to an individual's cognitive attitudes. I argue that epistemic virtues (1) further the moral imperative to do better at achieving successful translation while avoiding unnecessary experiments and (2) guide moral reasoning and decision making in harm-benefit analyses that precede the choice of an animal model in experiments.
Aer a literature review of contemporary virtue epistemology, Chapter 1 builds on a theoretical framework where epistemic virtues are intended in a responsibilist sense, as best intellectual character traits that should characterize any responsible knower.
Chapter 2 presents three arguments which focus on the normative significance of epistemic virtues. Here it is shown that a) better knowledge facilitates moral reasoning by reducing the margin of uncertainty and bias in the assessment of animal experiments and that b) epistemic virtues represent standards of behavior for members of an epistemic community who are supposed to be responsible for the way they acquire knowledge.
Finally, Chapter 3 considers a selection of epistemic virtues that can, more than others, mitigate the epistemic dimension of translational failures. Contextually, each virtue is examined and tested in practical cases."
Dances with wolves. Een historisch onderzoek naar natuurbegrip en hoe dit het wolfbeleid beïnvloedt.,"['Leeuwerink, Merel']","['Schouten, Steven']",2022-07-28T01:01:33Z,NL,"['natuurbegrip, natuurbeeld, Bruno Latour, wolf, beleid, antropocentrische visie, ecocentrische visie, biocentrische visie']",Cultuurgeschiedenis van modern Europa,"Anno 2022 zijn er drie ethische basisvisies op natuur die het moderne natuurbegrip kenmerken; de antropocentrische, de ecocentrische en de biocentrische visie. Vanuit die verschillende visies hebben mensen zich ook een mening gevormd over de wolf waardoor er een verhit wolfdebat is ontstaan. In Dances with wolves wordt de vraag gesteld in hoeverre de drie ethische basisvisies op natuur, die het moderne natuurbegrip kenmerken, van invloed zijn op het geheel aan beleid dat ten aanzien van de wolf is en wordt gemaakt. Wordt er mét de wolf gedanst of om hem heen?
De drie ethische basisvisies zijn drie verschillende moderne wijzen waarop natuur kan worden begrepen. Frictie tussen de basisvisies leidt tot een continu spanningsveld, hetgeen resulteert in wisselende dominante posities van de visie die de meeste invloed uitoefent op het natuurbeleid in zijn algemeenheid. Op grond van een beleidsarrangementenbenadering is specifiek het Nederlands wolfbeleid geanalyseerd sinds de wolf terug is op Nederlandse bodem (2013). Uit deze analyse blijkt dat vanuit bepaalde natuurdiscoursen wolfbeleid tot stand komt. Zo draagt een coalitie van overheidsorganen, deskundigen en natuurorganisaties een ecocentrisch discours uit. Omdat deze coalitie de meeste macht heeft ten aanzien van wolfbeleid leidt deze positie ten opzichte van belangenbehartigers (bijvoorbeeld boeren en herders) ertoe, dat de invloed van dit ecocentrische natuurbegrip op wolfbeleid erg groot is.
Het denken vanuit drie ethische basisvisies veronderstelt dat anno 2022 nog steeds vanuit de oude moderne ideeën wordt gedacht, namelijk dat cultuur en natuur als een binaire tegenstelling wordt gezien. In de drie ethische basisvisies wordt nog altijd in meer of mindere mate uitgegaan van het gegeven dat natuur een maakbaar object is dat beïnvloed kan worden. Dit is ook het geval ten aanzien van de wolf. De wolf wordt niet gezien als een actant maar als een wezen waarover beleid moet worden gemaakt. Er wordt dus vooral om de wolf heengedanst. De wolf heeft zich echter getoond als actant in onze samenleving. Een nieuw natuurbegrip zoals Bruno Latour bepleit zou daarom pas echt modern zijn in tegenstelling tot de zogenaamde moderne natuurbegrippen die door de basisvisies gekenmerkt worden. Het zou ook de opening bieden om als beleidsmakers mét de wolf te gaan dansen."
Testing the Effectiveness of Personal Names for Alerting Transitions in Semi-Automated Cars,"['Xu, Jiaxin']","['Janssen, Chris']",2022-07-28T01:01:46Z,EN,['(semi-)automated cars; speech alerts; personal names; transitions of control; non-driving tasks; human-automation interaction'],Applied Cognitive Psychology,"This thesis investigates how a speech alert that uses a driver’s own name affects the speed, accuracy, and subjective experience of responding to transitions of control in the context of semi-automated driving. Preceding studies have shown that a personal name can be an effective stimulus to capture attention. However, studies that used names for alerts in automotive settings found mixed results when comparing the effectiveness between name and non-name conditions. In this thesis, an experiment with a simulated semi-automated car was conducted, in which participants were watching driving videos while playing a mobile game. Occasionally they heard speech alerts that started with either their name or a warning sound. They were required to immediately disengage from the game and respond to the alerts by pressing a button on the steering wheel or by pressing the brake. Results showed that participants’ response times were significantly faster when hearing the alerts containing their names. There was no difference in subjective experience between conditions found. The results suggest that one’s name is a useful addition to an in-car alert and warrants deeper investigation for future research."
The neo-NHS: How neoliberalism has been transplanted into the heart of the British health service,"['Doherty, Paul']","['Haan, I. de']",2022-07-28T01:01:38Z,EN,[],Geschiedenis van Politiek en Maatschappij,"In 1948, Britain established a free health care system that was to be ran by the government, 
called the National Health Service (NHS). This led to the growth of a large public institution
that was accessed by millions and became the country’s largest employer. It is central to the 
British welfare state, which was implemented in the aftermath of the Second World War, as 
part of the ‘Keynesian policy paradigm.’ In the 1970s, a succession of economic and social 
crises delegitimised the Keynesian paradigm and led it to be replaced by ‘neoliberalism.’ This 
ideology heralded the era of the small state, free market economics and the ascendancy of the 
private sector. The neoliberal prognosis was that the welfare state was too expansive and 
needed to be reformed. This asked the question of whether the government could maintain 
something as large as the NHS. Over forty years later and the NHS is still in place, however, 
it has been subject to change. This thesis will study the NHS over this period to examine how 
neoliberal policy has led to the reform of the health service, whilst maintaining the principle 
of free health care provided by the government. I will try to find evidence of marketisation, 
privatisation and cuts, as they represent the core principles of neoliberal policy."
The Flip Side of the Coin - The Environmental Footprint of Blockchain-Based NFT Art,"['Albers van der Linden, Thomas']","['Raessens, J.F.F.']",2022-07-28T01:01:43Z,EN,['critical discourse analysis; blockchain technology; NFT art; mild social constructivism; social shaping of technology; environmental footprint; sustainability'],New Media and Digital Culture,"In 2021, blockchain-based NFT technologies saw a tremendous surge in popularity. The newfound 
possibility of exclusive digital ownership has caused mass hysteria, especially in the art market. Both in 
popular culture and academia, the promises of blockchain technology were met with great enthusiasm. 
However, due to the energy-intensive cryptographic algorithms that blockchain relies on, it was found 
that the technology has an enormous environmental footprint. To uncover the true impact of NFT art, 
environmentally conscious digital artist Memo Akten published a series of articles in late 2020. In 
response to his work, a lively discussion about the unsustainability of blockchain was evoked. This 
research analyzes how the environmental discourse surrounding blockchain-based NFT art may point to 
a possible social shaping of the technology. In order to shed light on this supposed relationship, a critical 
discourse analysis (CDA) of the discourses surrounding Memo Akten’s article series was performed. 
The study takes the social shaping of technology as its main theoretical lens, integrating it with the 
theoretical assumptions of the discourse-analytical research tradition. Prior to this research, no critical 
inquiry into discourses surrounding the environmental footprint of blockchain technologies had been 
done. Results show that the author of the main discursive event has been able to popularize the discourse 
under investigation, by constructing the environmental footprint of NFT technology as an existential 
threat. Further, observations made in the second and third stages of the analysis suggest that there may 
indeed be a social shaping of technology possible as a result of discursive practices. However, by no 
means does this research suggest that it provides evidence for this presumed effect. Instead, it serves as 
a theoretical starting point for future empirical research on the intricate relationship between society and 
technology."

of the relationship between subjects and ‘the world’ (object). I depart from the position of 
sociologist Hartmut Rosa: he holds that a successful, good or desirable life is dependent on 
the quality of one’s relationship to the world. He identifies a resonant relation as the good 
type of relation. This brings me to the main questions: how and to what extent can resonance 
provide the metric of utility? And how and to what extent can this relational utilitarianism be

Low adherence to phosphate binders due to a high pill burden is an important factor. A combined, tailored pharmacist intervention with dose optimization was implemented focusing on therapeutic-related factors and patient-related factors to obtain phosphate control in hemodialysis (HD) patients.
Methods: This study was conducted at a hospital in The Netherlands as a single-centre, intervention study with a within patient pre-post design. In order to identify potential patient adherence barriers, we implemented an individualized intervention. Firstly, multiple pharmacist counselling sessions were performed to identify potential patient adherence barriers with Quick Barrier Scan (QBS), the medication adherence was investigated with the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5) and the Recognizing and Addressing Limited Pharmaceutical Literacy (RALPH) interview guide was used to explore the patients’ health literacy. Secondly, the pharmacist implemented tailored intervention with dose optimization. Finally, the serum phosphate control was evaluated after the intervention.
Results: A total of 28 patients were enrolled in the study for the analysis of serum phosphate level and MARS-5. Mean baseline serum phosphate level was 2.02 mmol/L (SD = 0.45). Serum phosphate level at month 1 decreased to 1.86 mmol/L (SD=0.43). A similar result was found for month 2 and 3 (1.98 mmol/L). However, the paired T-test showed no significant effect in changes in serum phosphate level between pre-intervention and 1,2 and 3 months after intervention (p = 0.125, p = 0.630 and p = 0.690). In addition, the percentage of patients with phosphate regulation (≤ 1.50 mmol/L) increased from 0% (n=28) at baseline, to 21.4%% (n=28) and 17.9% (n=27) and 14.3% (n=28) for 1,2 and 3 months after the intervention respectively. Total MARS-5 scores at pre-intervention resulted in a median (IQR) score of 0.3 (0.0-0.6) and a median (IQR) score of 4.8 (0.4 – 5.0) 3 months after the intervention.
Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of personalized patient counselling sessions in combination with lowering phosphate binder pill burden to positive effects on the serum phosphate levels and phosphate binder adherence. However, the change in serum phosphate level was no significant. Notwithstanding the relatively limited sample size, this study offers valuable insights into personalized intervention with dose optimization to improve phosphate control. Therefore, this study lays the groundwork for future research into personalized intervention strategies."
"Hotspots of Violence, Narratives of Hope","['Schoor, Rikst van der']","['Rigney, Ann']",2022-07-28T01:02:39Z,EN,['Paris Commune; Cultural Memory; Narratology; Self-defence; Genre; Medium; Violence.'],Comparative Literary Studies,"How do we deal with things that do not fit the story we want to tell? The Paris Commune was a short-lived workers’ revolution in the spring of 1871. After two months, it was bloodily put down by the French army, who massacred the Communard.e.s in the Semaine Sanglante. Despite attempts of the French government to suppress and villify the Commune, it has since lived on in songs, books, and films; inspiring artists, thinkers, and politicians; and has been celebrated all around the world. Little scholarly attention, however, has gone out to the acts of violence committed by the Communard.e.s themselves. This project seeks to rectify that by studying how recent cultural products deal with Communard violence. Four cases across different media and genres are examined to see how they deal with three different “hotspots”: the fire and destruction wreaked on Paris, the hostages who were executed by Communard.e.s, and the fighting against the French army during the Semaine Sanglante. 
The project demonstrates how all cases employ a range of argumentative and narrative strategies to legitimate these instances of violence, using the various affordances of their specific medium and genre to bring across a certain interpretation of the Commune. In particular, they legitimise the Communard violence by invoking self-defence, thereby effectively extending their own idea of self to that of the Communard.e.s. As a result, the participants in the Commune are humanised: they are not beasts or martyrs, but rounded and flawed people. In precisely this way, the Commune is kept alive and accessible for new generations at the 150th anniversary in 2021."
Graphs of endomorphisms of elliptic curves over finite fields,"['Wennekes, Marlien']","['Cornelissen, Gunther']",2022-07-29T00:00:45Z,EN,['elliptic curves;dynamical systems;endomorphism;graph;'],Mathematical Sciences,"There is a growing body of research on dynamics of maps over finite sets; such a map f : X → X is described by a finite directed graph with vertex set X and edges from x ∈ X to f(x) ∈ X. In general one finds that maps with algebraic properties give more symmetrical graphs than random graphs. In this context, we study endomorphisms of ordinary elliptic curves over finite fields with endomorphism ring equal to the maximal order of a quadratic number field. We translate the graph theory problem into an algebraic number-theoretic one. We use the theory of rational maps by x-coordinate projection of endomorphisms by Ugolini, and on dynamics of Dedekind domains by Qureshi and Reis, to derive precisely the cycles and trees that the graphs consist of. Next, we look at the curve E : y^2 = x^3 − x over Fp to apply this theory. We run some computer experiments for endomorphisms α = a ± bi with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 9 for the first 1000 prime numbers where E is ordinary. We look at two invariants: the number of points in cycles and the maximal cycle length. We study the proportion of points in cycles, looking at the density of primes where this proportion is maximal. Using congruence relations, we find a lower bound for endomorphisms which do not contain split primes. We also find more general results concerning the proportion of points experimentally. Next, we look at the proportion of cyclic points that are contained in the maximal cycle. We study experimentally how the proportion behaves as p increases in size; and find a big difference in the case where the norm of the endomorphism is even or odd. Further, we look into when the proportion is maximal. In the even case, the maximum proportion is 1; in the odd case it is < 1. For the odd case, we give a conjecture describing the value of the maximum proportion as a function of the endomorphism, which we base on the experimental data and on the case where the graph has only a minimal number of points."
Barrier islands face a gradual path toward drowning under most sea level rise scenarios,"['Portos Amill, Laura']","['Swart, H.E. de']",2022-07-29T00:00:54Z,EN,['Barrier islands; Tidal inlets; Sea level rise; Drowning; Morphodynamic model; Overwash'],Climate Physics,"The expected increase in rates of sea level rise during the 21st century and beyond may cause tidal inlets to expand and barrier islands to drown. However, timescales involved in the drowning process are difficult to predict due to lack of observations. Here we present results obtained with an adapted version of a barrier island model to study inlet morphodynamics under sea level rise. Our new model (BRIE-D) allows for changes in the alongshore extent of the barrier lying below sea level. These concern reductions in barrier width, barrier height, as well as lateral expansion of tidal inlets. Model results show that the evolution of barrier islands is mostly susceptible to the wave height and the rate of sea level rise that they experience. It turns out that it takes hundreds of years for barrier islands to drown in response to high rates of sea level rise (more than 15 mm/yr). Furthermore, increasing rates of sea level rise cause an earlier and more severe barrier drowning in environments with low waves. Barrier systems that face higher waves can undergo more frequent inlet closures (due to a larger amount of sediment imported into the inlets), but also the degree of barrier drowning might increase (due to a deepening of the toe of the shoreface). Whether one process dominates over the other depends on the rate of sea level rise."

Using Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram of these particles for varying aspect ratios of length to diameter (L/D), sphere diameter to rod diameter (σ/D) and barbell end spherocylinders length to rod diameter (Le/D). As part of our study we investigate the stability of a possible cholesteric phase. Colloids and other achiral particles rarely exhibit a cholesteric phase, thus we take particular interest in investigating the existence of the cholesteric phase in this system. Our results show the destabilisation of the nematic phase, with respect to the isotropic phase, with increases of σ/D. In contrast increases in L/D stabilise the nematic phase. Additionally the spheres and spherocylinders destabilise the smectic phase and crystal phase but allow the formation of a columnar phase. The stability of the smectic phase decreases with Le/D."

The lack of these skills can lead to negative developmental outcomes. A good way to improve these skills in children is by using behavioral game interventions. However, getting a high learning gain and motivation in a child is challenging. Narrative could be a possible solution, as adding a story to a game can help with motivation, immersion, empathy, and even learning gain. This study looks at the possibility of using narrative as a way to improve the learning gain in a game intervention for training social emotional skills. This was done using an experiment where participants played a version of a game with a story or a version of a game without a story. Before and after the game the participants filled in a questionnaire so that the motivation and learning gain could be measured. Even though the results were not significant, the results still showed a trend that adding narrative to a game could still improve the motivation of the player. For the learning gain more testing has to be done. It was expected to see positive learning gains after playing the game, but this was not the case. The results showed negative learning gains for most of the participants. The data showed some significant positive correlations between motivational data, which is reason for future research. More research has to be done to see if narrative can help participants improve their learning gain in a game intervention for training social emotional skills."

These terms are not present in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations that are commonly used to describe individual sublattice dynamics. In this thesis, we present a Caldeira-Leggett approach within the Keldysh path integral formalism to base the dissipative equations for two-sublattice antiferromagnets on a more microscopic description. From this, we argue that the dissipative dynamics are determined by the specific form of system-bath structure through which the system dissipates. We recover phenomenological equations in the quasi-classical limit and find that the presence of inter-sublattice damping terms originate from the thermal coupling between the sublattices. Remarkably, we find that in a special case the N´eel order is a dissipation-free mode. Subsequently, we argue that the existence of dissipation-free modes is a more general phenomenon and will occur in systems composed of two subsystems where the bath is shared between the two subsystems."

Daarvoor is het belangrijk om iets te weten van de 'nestgeur' van de GKv. Daarom geeft dit onderzoek tevens een overzicht van de geschiedenis van deze kerk met z'n eigen specifieke zuil en achterban. Ook wordt inzichtelijk hoe het synodebesluit van 2017 tot stand is gekomen. Maar de kern van het onderzoek betreft de ervaring van vrouwelijke ambtsdragers in deze kerk. Hoe kijken zij nu zelf naar hun nieuwe positie en hun ambt en nemen ze daarin een duidelijk standpunt in? Verschilt hun ambtsvisie van mannelijke ambtsdragers en wat vinden zij van hun nieuwe, vrouwelijke collega’s? De theologische discussie ('zwijgteksten' en de scheppingsorde) die ten grondslag ligt aan het besluit van openstelling van de ambten komt aan de orde, maar de eerste ervaringen van vrouwelijke ambtsdragers staan in dit onderzoek centraal. Belangrijkste uitkomsten zijn: vrouwen zijn wat aarzelend in hun spreken over hun eigen roeping, dit in tegenstelling tot mannelijke ambtsdragers. Vrouwen spreken vanuit een ander narratief over hun ambt en roeping. Zij benadrukken niet zozeer hun eigen persoonlijk roeping, maar vooral de ‘verantwoordelijkheid voor de ander’. Zij lijken daarmee hun ambt meer in de gelijkwaardige communicatie met de ander te zien, dan iets dat te maken heeft autoriteit. Verrassend aan de interviews met zowel de vrouwelijke als de mannelijke 
ambtsdragers is de vanzelfsprekende goedkeuring voor openstelling van de ambten. Daarbij valt op dat er een groot verschil is tussen het jarenlange, moeizame theologische debat, waarover veel gepubliceerd is, en de mening van het ´gewone kerklid´, dat het allemaal wel prima vindt en voor wie het al veel eerder had gemogen."
Incognito men unmasked.

The Venetian Academy offered a refuge to men who were affected on the level of their experience of gender by tensions on socio-political, economic, cultural and intellectual levels. These tensions are taken as the elements of a crisis of masculinity, to which freedom in writing offered a means of escape. A close reading of Antonio Rocco’s l’Alcibiade fanciullo a scola confirms not only the Incogniti’s fascination with non-(hetero)normative masculinity, it also reveals both how corrupt masculinity can become within a patriarchal system, as well as the disturbing extremes a literary articulation of libertinism’s predilection of a naturalist sexual ethics could reach. A focus on paratextual material in the Incogniti environment shows the importance of co-constructive bonds between men, and the practice of gifting texts to each other, usually through the printing of dedicatory epistles in collectively published works, establishes the Academy as a “literary fraternity”. Libertinism’s critical attitude against power constituted a shared discursive code, and remained so even after Ferrante Pallavicino’s execution for lèse majesté forced the Incogniti into a position of heightened circumspection. However, the crisis of masculinity became ever more anxious as the Incogniti’s preferred way of navigating it – writing and publishing – proved limited. Despite the cultural dominance of the Academy in Venice, the Incogniti still had to heed to patriarchal exigencies exerted by the early modern system of hegemonial masculinity."

Moral distress is said to occur when one acknowledges the right thing to do but is unable to act upon it. Moral emotions are found to be significant predictors of the severity of moral distress. Moreover, religiousness and Antonovsky’s Sense of Coherence (SOC) have repeatedly been associated with stress outcome. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between moral emotions and moral distress. Secondly, the mediating or moderating role of religiousness and SOC is examined. Methods. Data collection was held in April 2022 via online questionnaires on platform Qualtrics Survey Solutions. The sample consists of 77 Greek participants. For each participant, data were collected about socio-demographic profile and religious beliefs. Cognitions following a traumatic moral conflict were assessed through MR-MI, MIAS scales. SOC was measured using the short version SOC-13. Results. Pearsons’s R and regression analyses showed that moral distress is positively correlated and significantly predicted by moral emotions. Moral distress was also negatively correlated with SOC. Moderation analysis indicated that the relationship between moral emotions and moral distress only really emerges in people with low or average levels of SOC. Results for mediations and the variable religiousness were non-significant. Discussion The research highlights the significant relationship between moral emotions, SOC and moral distress and through empirical data points out the importance of addressing SOC before directly dealing with traumatic moral distress."
Remote working and Boreout during Covid-19: The extent of remote working and the role of work characteristics and personal factors in contributing to Boreout.,"['Maher, Sarah']","['Taris, Toon']",2022-08-02T00:01:17Z,EN,[],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","The sudden increase in remote working following the outbreak of Covid-19 provides a unique context to explore the relationship between remote working and employee well-being. An accumulating body of research suggests that remote working alters work characteristics which themselves may explain the relationship between remote working and employee outcomes. The present study aims to explore the association between the extent of remote working and boreout, as well as to test whether certain job characteristics (i.e. job autonomy and motivational demands) and personal characteristics (i.e. self-regulation) act as explanatory mechanisms underlying this relationship. A sample of 195 currently employed individuals (M= 37.8 years) completed the online questionnaire. Boreout was measured by combining the individual scores for exhaustion and boredom. Multiple regression analyses and mediation analyses were conducted to test the hypotheses. Job autonomy and motivational demands were shown to be predictors of boreout, but the degree to which an employee works remotely was not shown to be a predictor. The extent of remote working was, however, both negatively and positively indirectly related to boreout through job autonomy and motivational demands. Demonstrating how the extent of remote working contributes to employee outcomes through these mediators not only helps researchers in recognising the complexities of remote working but also educates workers and others looking to make informed choices about the trend of increased remote working. Organisations can safeguard the well-being of their employees by designing working models which manage the extent of remote working, promote greater job autonomy and limit motivational demands. These findings on remote working during Covid-19 can, beyond the immediate context of the pandemic, guide flexible work practices after the pandemic."

finds that the Ceaușescu regime purposefully used sports as a tool to shape its international
image. As a guiding compass in the analysis, this work lays out and utilises a conceptual
framework of sports diplomacy. By triangulating this with existing historiography and Dutch
and American newspapers, it enquires how impactful this mobilisation of athletic achievements
was in modifying Romania’s image abroad. Acknowledging and supporting the shift in
academia towards smaller states as subjects of Cold War research, this work aims to improve
the conceptual relationship between sports and diplomacy within IR as well as contribute to

How Female Leaders Persevere: Gender and Leader Identity as Protectors of Mental Health and Motivation,"['Köhler, Antonia']","['Domen, A.J.H.']",2022-08-02T00:01:11Z,EN,['Female leadership; social identity; gender identity; leader identity; identity conflict; mental health; motivation to lead'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Women in leadership frequently face stigma, bias, and other societal pressures due to 
their occupation still largely being associated with masculine traits. Simultaneously, female 
leaders have two identities, being a woman and being a leader. They differ in social norms 
regarding behavior and thought, thereby often leading them to conflict as they seem 
mismatched. Such conflict can also have detrimental impacts on female leaders’ mental 
health and motivation to lead. The present study aimed to investigate whether gender and 
leader identity, the way an individual feels about their gender and occupational social group, 
separately impact female leaders’ stress, life satisfaction, affective motivation to lead, and 
social-normative motivation to lead. Additionally, it tested whether the conflict between the 
two identities could explain the relationships between female leaders’ identities and the listed 
mental health and motivation to lead outcomes. Lastly, it was tested whether the extent to 
which a female leader’s held traditional gender role beliefs increased the strength of the 
relationship between gender identity and identity conflict. Analyses revealed that a high level 
of gender and leader identity, separately, could have a protective effect on identity conflict,
stress, life-satisfaction, and affective motivation to lead. A low level of either identity could 
have an aggravating effect on the same outcomes. The expected mediating and moderating 
effects of identity conflict and traditional gender role beliefs were not found. Results are 
discussed considering implications and limitations. It is concluded that female leaders should 
strive for a high level of either gender or leader identity and that organizations should design 
strategies to encourage this, considering the benefits for mental health and motivation to lead."

These outcomes include exhaustion as the most frequent symptom of being overly concerned about work. The two other outcomes are career satisfaction and work-life balance. We also controlled for variables including autonomy, support and job demands. 
96 participants filled out a questionnaire including items such as the DUWAS, SWING, Career Satisfaction Survey, Job Content Questionnaire, Job Crafting Scale, and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. The data was analysed through multiple linear regressions on SPSS.
The results showed that workaholism is positively related to exhaustion and work-life conflict. Furthermore, support was an important predictor of work-life conflict and exhaustion. The process analyses also demonstrated that there are strong relationships between the control variables and job crafting. However, none of the job crafting behaviors were shown to be significant to the outcomes, except the social resources job crafting behaviors.
This study showed the importance of job crafting and more specifically, social resources at work to decrease negative outcomes. Organizations should focus on social support for their employees, teach them how and allow them to craft their jobs."

life are related. Online questionnaire data (N = 158) revealed that authenticity and meaning in 
life were positively related. Furthermore, no contribution of any separate basic need to meaning 
in life was found and no separate basic need was found to mediate the relationship between 
authenticity and meaning in life. The basic needs combined were responsible for a small 
contribution to meaning in life and a marginal partial mediation in the relationship between

Indonesian Throughflow transport in an eddy-resolving climate model,"['Rodrigo, Socorro']","['Wieners, C.E.']",2022-08-05T00:00:33Z,EN,['Indonesian Throughflow; oceanography; global climate models'],Climate Physics,"The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) is an important pathway in global circulation, providing a passage for warm and fresh waters from the Pacific to enter the Indian Ocean. Modelling it is a challenge: in order to resolve the narrow straits of the Indonesian seas, relatively high horizontal resolution is required; additionally, as a component of thermohaline circulation, a global or quasi-global model is required. Analysed in this study are the results of the International Laboratory for High-Resolution Earth System Prediction (iHESP) High-Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP) run of the Community Earth System Model version 1.3 (CESM 1.3) with nominal 0.1°, eddy-resolving ocean resolution. In this study, we will investigate if the model captures the Indonesian Throughflow transport, interannual variability, and future trends.

A comparison is made between the modelled and observed transport through four passageways of the throughflow: the Makassar Strait, Timor Passage, Ombai Strait, and Lombok Strait. In comparison with the observations, the model underestimated winter transport; nonetheless, there is a good correspondence in the mean depth-integrated transport except in Ombai Strait for which there are ~1 Sv estimations below 300 m. We also compare the geostrophic transport from observations and total transport from the model at a survey transect called the IX1. This transect is in the Indian Ocean and is often used as a proxy for total ITF transport. The yearly average of modelled transport (-11.51 +/- 6.13 Sv) across the IX1 line for the top 400 m is much higher by approximately 7 Sv than that of observed geostrophic transport (-4.88 +/- 3.50 Sv). This difference might be accounted for by Ekman transport and flow below 400 m.

The interannual variability of the tropical Pacific Ocean has a significant effect on ITF transport. Through lead-lag correlations, the ITF transport correlates significantly with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) from July to October. By compositing the years by ENSO phase, we see the expected weakening of transport during El Niño and strengthening during La Niña. The interannual variations in the Indian Ocean also have an effect but not with statistical significance."

use contraceptives than their native Dutch peers. Based on the assumption that the attitudes
regarding gender equality of non-Western immigrant adolescents are strongly in line with the
sexual double standard, this study examines whether their traditional gender attitudes can
explain their lower contraceptive use (i.e., condom only, pill only and the dual method use).
Cross-sectional, nationally representative data from the 2017 Dutch Health Behaviour in
School-aged Children (HBSC) study were used. The sample included 773 sexually active
adolescents aged 12-18 (M = 16.17, SD = 1.34). A mediation analysis was conducted. Results
showed that adolescents with a non-Western migration background were less likely to report
both pill use (OR = 0.29 [0.12, 0.71]) and dual method use (OR = 0.20 [0.08, 0.47]) than their
native Dutch peers at last sexual intercourse. No difference was found for condom use.
Attitudes regarding gender equality did not explain the association between migration
background and contraceptive use. Therefore, research into other potential explanatory
factors (such as sexual communication and family affluence) is needed. Alternatively, a
different measuring instrument for attitudes regarding gender equality may yield different
results."
Incidence and determinants of flucloxacillin-induced hypokalaemia,"['Verbrugge, Thimo']","['Mantel-Teeuwisse, A.K.']",2022-08-04T23:00:51Z,EN,[],Farmacie,"Intravenous flucloxacillin is used to treat severe infections in hospitalized patients. Treatment with high dose intravenous flucloxacillin can lead to potentially life threatening hypokalaemia as adverse event. In this single-centre retrospective observational cohort study, we investigated the incidence and severity of hypokalaemia in patients treated with intravenous flucloxacillin. Furthermore, risk factors for flucloxacillin-induced hypokalaemia were identified.
All patients treated for at least 48 hours with ceftriaxone or intravenous flucloxacillin and a normal baseline serum potassium level were included. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of hypokalaemia presented as the percentage of patients with a serum potassium measurement <3.5 mmol/L two to five days after initiation of antibiotic treatment. Logistic regression modelling was used to investigate the influence of sex and other risk factors on the development of flucloxacillin-induced hypokalaemia.
In total 2290 patients treated with ceftriaxone and 452 patients treated with flucloxacillin were included. The incidence of hypokalaemia was 13.1% in patients receiving flucloxacillin. The incidence of moderate and severe hypokalaemia were respectively 1.3% and 0.2%. Identified risk factors for the development of hypokalaemia in patients treated with flucloxacillin were lower baseline potassium levels, older age and lower BMI.
The incidence of hypokalaemia is increased in patients receiving flucloxacillin compared to patients receiving ceftriaxone. Healthcare providers should be aware of the risk for developing hypokalaemia in patients treated with intravenous flucloxacillin, especially in patients with risk factors."
Semi-automatic calcium scoring in CT-scans,"['Gutiérrez Santamaría, Sofía']","['Vincken, Koen']",2022-08-04T23:00:38Z,EN,[],Medical Imaging,"Vascular calcification is the pathological deposition of calcium in vascular structures and it is considered a complication of atherosclerosis. Vascular calcium detection by Computed Tomography (CT) can be used as a clinical marker of atherosclerosis. Nowadays, calcium scoring is mainly based on the Agatston method, although there are others based on the volume or mass of the calcifications.

In this study, semi-automatic functionalities are implemented in a new calcium-scoring software application based on MeVisLab with the sole purpose of saving radiologists time in their clinical practice. On the one hand, the interpolation of calcification segmentations have been implemented and on the other hand, the Agatston and volume scores have been computed. For its assessment, the results obtained are compared with those from imageXplorer, the software used so far, which is considered the ""gold standard"" in this study.

For the interpolation of calcification segmentations, Dice coefficients that compare the similarity between the segmentations performed in imageXplorer and MeVisLab were calculated. The values obtained before using the editing modes fall in the range [2.3∙10-4 - 0.7] and those obtained afterwards are in the range [0.8 - 1.0]. As for the computation of the calcium scores, a Student t-test between the calcium scores from imageXplorer and MeVisLab was conducted. For both the Agatston Score (t32 = 0.03, p = 0.97) and the volume score (t32 = 0.04, p = 0.96) not statistically difference was found. Both the interpolation of calcification segmentations and the computation of the calcium scores are validated, although some future improvements are suggested."

development into action as resources are being depleted. The production of synthetic materials
depends heavily on nonrenewable resources such as petroleum and handling these materials at
the end of their life cycle poses more waste issues every day. Reducing resource use and lowering
the ecological footprint is therefore a must and the paradigm shift to a circular economy needs to
be made. Mycelium materials contribute significantly to this paradigm shift as they obtain traits
that make them practicable alternatives to many synthetic materials in both economic and
environmental fields. They can even be used in construction work. The idea of using mycelium
materials for temporary structures is being explored by various artists and designers. To protect
the mycelium materials used in construction from decay, protective coatings are needed,
especially with the outlook on long-term use. As most synthetic polymers rely on nonrenewable
resources and are not sustainable, a variety of bio-based polymers was looked into in this
research. As all of the assessed bio-based polymers have desirable properties, their drawbacks

The present study examined the association between social support and resilience, and the possible moderating effect of having separated parents. The study was based on a nationally representative sample of 6.118 Dutch adolescents (aged 12 -16) from the Dutch Sentinel Study (Peilstationsonderzoek). Results showed that adolescents felt highly supported by both their parents and their friends. Experienced social support was positively associated with adolescents’ level of resilience. Having separated parents, did not moderate the association between social support and resilience. Further research is needed to study whether the circumstances of a separation influence resilience, and how adolescents make use of their support system during a separation."

The aim of this study is to investigate whether exposure to the online cancel culture decreases adolescents’ perceived freedom of speech within online and offline contexts. To answer this question, an online survey was conducted among 189 adolescents (N=189) from 18-25 years old. Regression analyses indicate that exposure to the online cancel culture, does not cause the offline perceived freedom of speech of youth to decrease. Gender differences were also investigated, since it was expected that girls would be affected to a greater extent by the online cancel culture than boys. We did not find support for this notion. What we did find is that boys were exposed to the online cancel culture more often, which could be due to the fact that they used social media more often. Strikingly enough, boys were also the ones to state to experience a higher level of freedom of speech within offline contexts."

However, convincing
and receiving investments can be challenging as early-stage investors base their decisions on multiple
factors. One of these factors is prior entrepreneurial experience. The investor’s perception of the role of
previous entrepreneurial success is clear. In contrast, researchers have shown conflicting views regarding
the role of entrepreneurial failure and the final funding decisions. On the one hand, some support that failure
results in valuable learnings that will be an asset for funding future ventures. On the other hand, some argue
that investors perceive failure negatively. Although the learning outcomes of failure can be considered a
positive effect, the research on how investors perceive it is still limited. This research sheds light on the
interplay between prior success & failure and investigates how investors perceive it. A between-subjects
experiment was performed on early-stage investors. The results present a clear relationship between prior
entrepreneurial success and the funding decision and show that investors value more the variety of
experiences (success and failure) compared to only success experiences. In addition, another finding is that
experienced entrepreneurs are more likely to receive more funding those novice entrepreneurs. The findings
contribute to the theories of investing decision & sense-making and have implications for the broader
understanding of investor cognition. Finally, the domain of prior entrepreneurial experience is examined in

Moreover, we aimed to examine what caused the lack of consensus on how female directorship is related to bank performance. By examining the Hedges-Olkin Meta- Analysis (HOMA) and Meta-Analytic Regression Analysis (MARA) results, we could draw relevant conclusions as to how female directorship is related to bank performance and as to what variables moderate the relationship between female directorship and bank performance. In the end, we first of all found that female directorship and two of the three most commonly employed measures of bank performance, videlicet ROE and Tobin’s Q, are positively related. Logically, we found that female directorship and bank performance are positively related. Hence, we found support that female board members promote better bank performance. Secondly, we found support that the board-level variables board size, board independence and CEO duality combined moderate the relationship between female directorship and bank performance. More specifically, we found that board size and board independence positively moderate the relationship between female directorship and bank performance, while CEO duality negatively moderates the relationship between female directorship and bank performance. However, we only found support that CEO duality individually moderates the relationship between female directorship and bank performance. This Master Thesis thus offers insights for banks to improve the gender diversity in their boards, thereby putting an end to the ‘old boys’ club’ culture and improving equality of opportunity for at least as qualified women."

The literature has failed to achieve consensus on the sign of the effect. Studies using descriptive statistical evidence argue for a positive effect, while most studies using econometric techniques find a negative effect. This conflict could be potentially due to the time frame used by most econometric studies. Most of these studies use a time span of at most 16 years, while descriptive statistical studies use data of at least two decades. This thesis uses long-run survey data of almost thirty years of the Dutch Central Bank Household Survey (DHS). This study hypothesises that in the short run wealth inequality decreases due to inheritances, but in the long run inheritances increase wealth inequality. To measure the effect in the short run, this study uses simple accounting identities based on Crawford and Hood (2016). To measure the long-run effect, it uses Maximum Likelihood estimation with logit models. The main finding of this study is that in the short run wealth inequality decreases, but that in the long run the effect on wealth inequality is ambiguous. The implication for economic policy is that taxation of inheritance of less wealthy individuals could increase wealth inequality, while taxation of wealthy inheritors could decrease wealth inequality."

The riskiness of the CEO’s decisions may have a large influence on the companies performance and the stakeholders’ appreciation. Ultimately, the riskiness of the CEO’s decision may even lead to bankruptcy. This thesis focuses on the influence a CEO can have on the level of risk taking of banks by analyzing the variables CEO tenure and Board co-option. There is no objective data directly representing the CEO power, but on basis of agency theory, stakeholder theory, and stewardship theory three hypotheses are formed on how the CEO tenure and board co-option ratio are influencing both the CEO power and the CEO’s willingness to take risks. The more power the CEO has, the more influence he can have in the amount of risk the bank takes. To test these hypotheses, the predictions were compared to a dataset consisting of data for 1060 banks from all over the world in the period 2000-2019. Small correlations were found, suggesting that both a higher CEO tenure and a higher Board co-option ratio come with an increase in the risk taking of the bank, which is not in accordance with the hypotheses and the agency theory. Furthermore, the interaction term of the CEO tenure and Board co-option ratio is positive whereas the individual trends are negative. This indicates that the common part of the CEO tenure and Board co-option ratio behaves differently than the non-overlapping part. This result is unexpected and is not in accordance with the hypothesis. However, all the observed correlations were either not statistically significant or very small and as such little support for the proposed models was found in the data. This indicates that the idea that the riskiness of the CEO’s decisions is driven by the CEO tenure and Board co-option has marginal predictive power and that other factors influencing the riskiness are dominant."

being announced during a hot legalization year and if it was legalized for recreational use
influence the magnitude of the effect. In order to check it, I perform an event study by
calculating CAAR for every legalization date for the event window from three days before
until three days after the legalization. The results are that the legalization of cannabis
decreases CAARs in the selected period on average by 0,7% at a 95 % confidence level and
that dummy variables proposed by me do not explain this effect or their influence is
negligibly minor. The study is important from the scientific perspective as it enriches the

provides a conclusion that investors should not invest in cannabis stocks in the closest days to
the legalization as it does not lead to earning abnormal returns."

The mediating role of Developmental Rewards and an Inclusive Organisational Culture in the relationship between Self Identity at Work and Binding to the Organisation,"['Kunneman, Joy']","['Altink-van den Berg, Wieby']",2022-08-10T00:00:38Z,EN,['Self Identity at Work; Binding to the Organisation; Developmental Rewards; Inclusive Organisational Culture; Mediation; Person-Environment Fit'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","In this study with self reports of 123 respondents who are employees from different organisations using an online survey, the relation between Self Identity at Work and Binding to the Organisation is examined, with Developmental Rewards and an Inclusive Organisational Culture as mediators. The startingpoint is the Person-Environment fit theory. Self Identity at Work is expected to have a positive relation with Binding to the Organisation, Developmental Rewards and an Inclusive Organisational Culture. Developmental Rewards and an Inclusive Organisational Culture are in their turn expected to have a positive relation with Binding to the Organisation and therefore are expected to be mediators in the positive relation between Self Identity at Work and Binding to the Organisation. The Linear Regression Analysis showed that Self Identity at Work is positively related to Binding to the Organisation. The two mediation analyses each confirmed the mediations of Developmental Rewards and an Inclusive Organisational Culture in the relation between Self Identity at Work and Binding to the Organisation (p < .05). The Conceptual Model as a whole is statistically significant, but the two mediators did not turn out to be statistically significant. Developmental Rewards and an Inclusive Organisational Culture do not additionally contribute to predicting Binding to the Organisation on top of Self Identity at Work. One of the suggestions for future research is to focus on the high correlation between the scales used in this study. It is concluded that organisations have to select employees who stand for the same things the organisation stands for (e.g. values, norms, beliefs and identity) and employees should look for organisations that match their identity, to increase Binding to the Organisation."
Promoting Healthy Food Choices: The Effect of the Nutri-Score on Healthy Food Choices among Young People of Different Educational Levels,"['Weetering, Davy van de']","['Blom, Stephanie']",2022-08-10T00:00:47Z,EN,['Nutri-Score; healthy food choices; educational level; nudge'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","One reason why people do not always make healthy food choices is because they lack nutritional knowledge to identify which food product is the healthier option. A way to simplify the process of making healthy food choices is by providing people with a specific front of package label: the Nutri-Score. Previous research showed that the Nutri-Score helps people identify the healthier food option, but the literature about its ability to nudge people into choosing the healthier option is inconclusive. In the current study, the effect of the Nutri-Score on healthy food choices among young Dutch people (aged 18 to 30) was investigated by the use of an online experiment. We expected that the Nutri-Score would lead to healthier food choices. Furthermore, we expected this presumed positive effect to be larger for lower than higher educated people since they have less nutritional knowledge and therefore would have more to gain from the Nutri-Score. Participants (N = 100) had to choose between three similar food products with different nutritional values. This was repeated with different products for eight trials. Participants in the experimental condition were provided with the Nutri-Score when making food choices. We found that the Nutri-Score indeed led to healthier food choices, but that this effect did not differ per educational level. A limitation of this research was the small sample size and the uneven distribution of educational level. Future research could investigate whether the effect of the Nutri-Score differs in a (simulated) real-life online supermarket."
"Actor and partner effects of COVID-19-related stress on relationship satisfaction, taking common dyadic coping into account: An APIM approach","['Lenten, Maron']","['Leer, Leslie van der']",2022-08-10T00:00:32Z,EN,['COVID-19-related stress; relationship satisfaction; common dyadic coping; Actor-Partner Interdependence Model; dyadic data'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Due to COVID-19 measures such as isolation and working from home, daily routines and work-life balances were disrupted, generating COVID-19-related stress. It was predicted that this stress would spillover from one partner to the other, influencing couple interactions. Stress can have a detrimental effect on marital communication, increasing the risk of relationship problems and decreasing relationship satisfaction. This lowered relationship satisfaction could lead to relationship dissolution or divorce. The present research therefore investigated the association between COVID-19-related stress and relationship satisfaction, taking common dyadic coping into account. Seven hypotheses were established and tested in two studies that both made use of existing data. Study 1 (N = 275) used individual data; Study 2 (N = 186) used dyadic data and the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. Based on both studies, it could be concluded that men's relationship satisfaction was not affected by COVID-19-related stress. Women's relationship satisfaction was only affected by their own COVID-19-related stress. Moreover, the results emphasize the importance of dyadic coping in a romantic relationship; when couples engaged in better common dyadic coping, they were more satisfied with their relationship. In Study 1, high levels of common dyadic coping even weakened the negative association between COVID-19-related stress and relationship satisfaction. Couples should therefore be provided with tools and information to enhance their dyadic coping skills, so that they can protect their relationship from the detrimental
effects of stress. Follow-up research could examine the role of different individual coping styles, and the influence of positive and negative attributions about one's partner's behavior."
Can we increase people's intention to eat more plant-based using dynamic norms with a reference to working together?,"['Hesselink, Esther']","['Boom, Lieke van den']",2022-08-10T00:00:41Z,EN,['Dynamic norms; Working together; Social norms; Plant-based'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","Introduction: The current study built on previous research on whether dynamic norms 
increase the intention to eat more plant-based. Moreover, it was examined if working together 
normative appeals increased the effectiveness of dynamic norms, and if this was mediated by 
psychological resistance and feelings of working together. 
Method: Dutch adults (N = 238) aged 19-75 years completed an online experiment. Two 
experimental (dynamic norm + working together and dynamic norm only) and two control 
(static norm and no-norm) conditions were compared on effectiveness in changing intention. 
Each condition provided participants with different social norm information about plant-based 
consumption in the Netherlands, based on a pilot study (N = 41). 
Results: Emphasizing the dynamic norm did not result in higher intentions to eat more plantbased, and a reference to working together did not increase the effect of the dynamic norm. 
Exploratory analyses indicated that there were no differences between conditions in their
estimates of current plant-based consumption. There was also no difference between the 
conditions when only people that gave a correct static norm estimate of 30-40% were
included. Feelings of working together did significantly relate to intention. 
Discussion: The non-significant findings could be explained by the heterogeneity of the 
sample or limitations of the study. Future research is needed to explore if and when dynamic 
norms and working together normative appeals work in the context of eating more plantbased. Additionally, interventions to enhance feelings of working together should be further 
explored."

This thesis will try to identify what drives and hinders SMEs in the Netherlands in their transition to a more sustainable business model. A final framework will be constructed supported by literature, theoretical reasoning, and interviews with consultants with experience in the transition of SMEs, to construct a clear, structured but generalized overview of what drives and hinders SMEs to attempt and complete their transition to a more sustainable business model. A single, definitive conclusion cannot be made with this explorative design of research. Nonetheless, this thesis does generate meaningful insights, like the importance of intrinsic motivation, and discussion points that future researchers can investigate and policymakers can take into account."
Is Pessimism a Mediator between Intolerance of Uncertainty and Depression/General Anxiety?,"['Moore, Richie']","['Tuijl, Lonneke van']",2022-08-10T00:00:40Z,EN,['Pessimism; Mediator; Intolerance of Uncertainty; IU; Depression; General Anxiety; GAD'],Clinical Psychology,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) is considered a transdiagnostic factor for several disorders including depression and generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), although the mechanism through which it has its effect is unclear. This study sought to examine if pessimism mediates the relationship between IU and depression/GAD. A cross-sectional design was used to test the hypothesis that pessimism is a mediator for the effect of IU on depression/GAD symptoms while controlling for rumination and worry respectively. Participants (N = 441) were recruited from Utrecht University and filled out several batteries of questionnaires, which were coded and analysed. Mixed results were found. Pessimism partially mediated the relationship between IU and depression while controlling for rumination, 95% CI[0.11, 0.2]. In the GAD model no mediation was found when controlling for worry, 95% CI [-0.01, 0.01], however, a partial mediation was found when worry was not controlled for, 95% CI[0.03, 0.06]. IU continued to explain a significant amount of variance of both depression and GAD when controlling for rumination and worry respectively. These results raise the possibility that pessimism may trigger worry causing a double mediation, and/or there is construct overlap between pessimism/worry. The results also have implications for theoretical models of IU, depression, and GAD, as well as for the development and maintenance of pessimism. Results also show that IU has a relationship with depression and GAD that is unique of pessimism, worry, and rumination, which has yet to be explained. There were several limitations of this study which require replication both longitudinally and experimentally."
"The natural interest rate, its drivers, and the future outlook.","['Renzo, Brando Di']","['Hayat, Raphié']",2022-08-09T00:03:00Z,EN,[],Banking and Finance,"This thesis provides a critical analysis of the factors driving the natural interest rate (also referred to as “r*”) in the Euro Area from 1995 to 2017. The research shows how the increased level of savings, shrinking globalization growth, and declining potential output growth are placing downward pressure on the r* of the countries of the Euro Area. The analysis suggests that the Great Recession and the European Sovereign Debt Crisis structurally changed the underlying dynamics of the drivers of the natural interest rate, showing a much stronger effect of the factors for the period following the financial crises. Finally, the stress tests conducted with the OLS model show very little flexibility of the natural interest rate under three different scenarios, namely severely adverse, adverse, and positive/stable scenario. This result raises questions about the effectiveness of the suggested factors in explaining the movements of r*, indicating that the underlying dynamics might be regulated by other factors such as the financial cycle, as proposed by another strand of literature. Concluding, the findings suggest that ECB, policymakers, and investors should keep a close eye on the future evolution of r* as the zero-lower bound appears to be here to stay, at least in the foreseeable future."

Uncovering the mechanism of action of cardiac arrhythmias caused by cancer therapeutics that target the hERG channel: A Literature review,"['Finger, Roxy']","['Heyden, M.A.G. van der']",2022-08-16T00:00:50Z,EN,"['hERG, arrhythmias, cancer therapeutics, Torsades de Pointes, QTc interval']",Drug Innovation,"Over the years, tremendous progression in development of cancer treatments has taken place with more 
cancer survivors as a result. As more cancer-survivors live with the long-term effects of the cancer 
treatments and will eventually deal with age-related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, the 
cardiovascular risk factors are magnified, and complications may lead to morbidity and mortality in 
cancer survivors. Anticancer drugs can lead to drug-induced arrhythmias by either direct or indirect 
changes, where the former could lead to the inhibition of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier 
K+ channel (IKr) which prolongs the QTc interval and eventually to the life-threatening ventricular 
arrhythmia Torsades de Pointes (TdP). The inhibition of IKr is related to the blockage of the human etherà-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium channel as this channel plays a role in the repolarization of the 
heart ventricles. Gaining more knowledge about the binding mechanisms of the different
chemotherapeutic drugs that target this channel may help the development of new chemotherapeutic 
agents without the adverse cardiotoxicity. 

In this review, the mechanism by which the hERG channel is inhibited by several chemotherapeutic 
drugs was assessed. The two mechanisms to inhibit the hERG channel are by either binding to the F656
and/or Y652 aromatic residues in the binding pocket of hERG, creating a direct blockage of the channel,
or inhibiting the trafficking of the fully glycosylated hERG channels to the cell surface by inhibiting the 
hERG-Hsp90 complex formation. Further research should be performed to elucidate the exact molecules 
that bind to the residues in the binding pocket and Hsp90 inhibition, which may lead to hERG channel 
degradation, should be accounted for when developing new chemotherapeutic agents. Agents that target 
the hERG channel, but do not induce arrhythmias, should still be carefully monitored in older patients
as they have an increased risk of proarrhythmogenic events. Elucidating the mechanism of the inhibition 
will make the development of new chemotherapeutic agents safer, even for the aging population."
Comparison of Metagenomic Tools in Gut Microbiome Analysis of COVID-19 Patients,"['Muhamad Rifki Ramadhan, Ramadhan']","['Top, J']",2022-08-16T00:00:42Z,EN,['metagenomics; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; microbiota; gut microbiome;'],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is originated in Hubei province of China in late 2019. Since then, it spread worldwide and caused a worldwide pandemic through most of 2020 and 2021. Gut microbiota has a key role in human health through its protective, trophic, and metabolic actions. Alteration of gut microbiota or gut dysbiosis is found in other virus infection (e.g., hepatitis B, HIV, and influenza). This raises a possibility that COVID-19 might also influence the gut microbiota. Metagenomic analysis is a powerful method to analyze microbiome composition in an environment. In this review, five studies that used metagenomic sequencing to analyze gut microbiome composition in COVID-19 patients were compared. The methods compared include taxonomic profiling, functional annotation, and differential abundance analysis. Based on the approach and tools used, one study differs substantially from the other four studies. This study used protein to protein BLAST for taxonomic profiling, manual alignment to various databases for functional annotation, and non-parametric test of Kruskal-Wallis H and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for differential abundance. In contrast, all four other studies used the biobakery pipeline (MetaPhlAn for taxonomic profiling and HUMAnN for functional annotation) and MaAsLin for the differential abundance analysis of the microbial taxa and pathway. The dissimilarity of the methods between these studies is reflected in the results. The results from each of the four other studies share more agreements with each other even though they are quite different as well. Besides the methods and tools used, the results of these studies are affected by their experimental design (e.g., sample size, sample collections, patients’ comorbidities), and the gut microbiota itself is influenced by a lot of other factors (e.g., diet, lifestyle, and medication). It is very difficult to point out whether the differences in the results are caused by the different tools used."

behavioral problems has proven difficult due to overlapping and transdiagnostic symptoms in 
different diagnoses. In addition, externalizing behaviors seem to be recorded more often 
because they are the most salient, causing internalizing and attachment problems to be 
overlooked. A multidisciplinary team that attends more to these risks may be possible; 
however, this care is expensive, and society favors supporting children in their natural 
environment. Potential family risk factors (FRF) may be causing the internalizing and 
attachment problems. 
Aims: This study looks at the difference in primary diagnoses before 
and after multidisciplinary examination (MDE) and whether these are explained by FRF.
Methods and procedure: 131 casefiles of children with MIBD (n = 131) were analyzed 
quantitatively. In addition, test data from care workers, teachers, and parents (n= 322) were 
used to measure the difference in internalizing and externalizing behavior. 
Outcome and results: The results indicate a significant change in primary diagnose after MDE using a chisquare independence test. A change in the primary diagnosis after MDE was more frequent in 
attachment disorders. Using repeated measures ANOVA there was no difference found in 
internalizing behavior pre- and post MDE. However, a significant decrease in externalizing 
behavior was found. Boys show more externalizing behavior than girls did. Due to logistic 
regression is appeared that exposing children to conflict can increase the change of primary 
diagnosis. Gender also influence the change, possibly because boys are more likely to show 
externalizing problems."

The research covers prose texts with composition dates ranging from the 8th to 12th centuries, i.e. Aislinge Óenguso, Breudwyt Maxen Wledic, Breuddwyd Rhonabwy, and Aislinge Meic Con Glinne, and is done on the basis of the theory of genre. The aim of this thesis is to enhance the understanding of medieval Insular secular dream narratives, and to provide an overview of shared themes between the texts. This is done through the exploration of medieval thought and literature surrounding dreams, its reflection on the corpus, medieval (dream-) vision literature, and its core characteristics. I expand upon similarities and discrepancies between central themes in a comparative analysis of the corpus, which results in a schematic overview of themes. I conclude that the unifying theme between the texts is the gaining of otherwise unobtainable knowledge through the dreams. In order for this paradox to work, I then propose that dreams and dreamscapes should be considered an inherent liminal space which sole purpose is to provide this knowledge."
The impact of the photosynthetic traits’ downregulation on the leaf nutrient composition,"['Wynaendts, Sophie']","['Boer, Hugo de']",2022-08-16T00:00:54Z,EN,"['Photosynthesis, stoichiometry, climate change, carbondioxide, nutrient content']",Sustainable Development,"The atmospheric CO2 concentration determines to a large extent how plants perform their
photosynthesis. The photosynthetic parameters, Vcmax and Jmax, explain respectively the maximum rate
of RuBisCo carboxylase activity and the maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport. Prior
research evidenced a positive relation between these photosynthetic traits and leaf nitrogen (Smith et
al., 2019). This research aims to analyse the relationship between the photosynthetic parameters,
nitrogen and phosphorus and the micronutrient content (zinc, iron and calcium) of four plant species.
The plant material has been derived from a field study in the Ebro basin (north-eastern Spain). The
photosynthetic parameters have been measured by using a leaf gas exchange machine. Input from the
experience during the internship at the nutrition company DSM has been used to determine which
micronutrients (iron, zinc and calcium) should be focused on to increase the relevance of this research.
For the elemental analysis of the leaf material, two machines have been used: the CN-analyser and the
Picofox TXRF spectrometer. The created dataset contains data from 34 samples, including five groups
(comprising four species: alfalfa, almond, grape, and apple; the latter including irrigated and nonirrigated samples), analysed on photosynthetic activity and elemental content. The results of the
research have been derived by using analysis of (co)variance (ANOVA and ANCOVA) statistical tests
and by analysing the variance for the absolute values for micronutrients compared to the variance with
the ratios with nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The results of the F-test indicate a decrease in variance
with the ratios with N and P compared to the absolute values of micronutrients, which gives insights in
the stoichiometry of the leaf. The ANOVA tests reveal a significant difference in nutrient content per
plant species. When performing the ANCOVA tests, it became clear that a significant correlation exists
between Jmax and Vcmax and the P concentration. Also, the P concentration is a significant determinant
for the absolute zinc (Zn) concentration and the Zn:N and Zn:P ratio in the plant, this is a positive
correlation. To conclude, the results of this research indicate that an increase in CO2 leads to a
downregulation of the photosynthetic traits, resulting in a lower concentration of leaf P, and a
significantly lower concentration of Zn in the leaf. Further research is needed to perform this analysis
on a larger sample size and to analyse other plant material besides the leaf, such as fruits and grains."

Studies do not agree on what the public place of religion is in the Netherlands as it is discussed whether the Netherlands can be seen as a secular country or rather as postsecular. With this thesis I will contribute to these studies by researching a specific case study as an example of the public space of religion, Orthodox Reformed Christian education. I will do this by focussing on what it means for the Gomarus Scholengemeenschap in Gorinchem to be explicitly Christian in the Netherlands through analysing this school through its policy plan, the guide for students, and by interviewing ex- pupils of these schools. By using a lived religion approach and a method of discourse analysis and interviews, the aim of this thesis is to provide an extensive analysis of how the Gomarus Scholengemeenschap is positioned in a secular country like the Netherlands.

Habermas’ work provides unique insight into the problems of communication and action coordination which are of utmost relevance to this discussion. This paper argues that social media platforms are formulated around a model which is highly vulnerable to the influences of fakenews content, and therefore instrumental reason. Furthermore, this thesis continues on to argue that this reliance on instrumental reason is not an intrinsic feature of these networks, but rather, that a platform could indeed be designed which embraces communicative action as its primary avenue of social cooperation. In so, the problem of polarization within the American political discourse might be ameliorated through the exercise of communicative rationality if provided a sufficiently rich argumentative space.
This thesis offers in first place, a Habermasean critique of the inner workings of social media platforms with respect to their vulnerability to instrumental reason. Thereafter, continues on to articulate specific features which would be of greatest impact with respect to the cultivation of communicative rationality on these networks."

Na veel politieke discussies werd in de Tweede Kamer een mijlpaal gevierd: als middel tot integratie werd in 1986 het lokale kiesrecht ingevoerd om migranten (als zij minstens vijf jaar in Nederland verbleven) mee te laten beslissen met het beleid op lokaal niveau. Van een strijd buiten de Kamer zou geen sprake zijn geweest en de mening van migranten werd ook niet belangrijk geacht. Het onderzoek toont echter aan dat de discussies rondom de migrantenkiesrechtuitbreiding niet in een politiek vacuüm ontstonden, zoals eerder werd gesuggereerd door de literatuur. Duidelijk wordt hoe de migrantenorganisaties in de jaren zeventig, tachtig en negentig zelf ook een strijd voerden om hun stem te laten horen en de invoering van het lokale (en daarna nationale) kiesrecht voor migranten trachtten te beïnvloeden, middels een analyse van de acties en strategieën. Aan de hand van drie migrantenorganisaties – KMAN, HTIB en de Utrechtse Migrantenraad – wordt deze strijd voor politieke inspraak aangetoond. Binnen de buitenlandse gemeenschap waren namelijk tal van migrantenorganisaties ontstaan en zij hadden ook een idee over de stem van hen als potentiële nieuwe kiezers in de samenleving.

However, it is unclear whether social participation can be guaranteed for autistic children at school. This study aimed to increase our understanding of the relation between school participation and psychosocial functioning in autistic pupils. In addition, we explored whether this relation could differ depending on children’s autistic traits, their family’s socio-economic status and school fit. Methods: This study is part of the Schoolyard Project, a multidisciplinary research project in collaboration with the Dutch Autism Register (NAR). Parents of two-hundred autistic children (158 boys; mean age = 12.23 years) participated in this study. They filled out multiple questionnaires on NAR, which measured their children’s school participation, psychosocial functioning, level of autistic traits, socio-economic status and school fit. Results: The outcomes showed that more school participation contributed to the prediction of fewer psychosocial problems of autistic pupils. However, no moderating effect of children’s autistic traits, their families’ socio-economic status or school fit was found on the relation between school participation and psychosocial functioning. Conclusions: We confirmed that more school participation was associated with fewer psychosocial problems for autistic children, highlighting the importance of increasing inclusiveness of school environment and promoting school participation. Although no moderating effect was found in this study, higher levels of autistic traits and lower families’ socio-economic status were related to more psychosocial problems in autistic pupils. Furthermore, our finding suggests that school fit is an important factor that should be taken into consideration when examining how to promote school participation and prevent psychosocial problems of autistic pupils. Future research should further explore how individual, family and school factors interact with autistic children’s school participation and psychosocial functioning. Knowledge in this regard can help parents, clinical and educational professionals finding the best way to support autistic children’s development."

 errors, alternative name variants, and historic entity changes. Traditional
 methods attempt to tackle these problems with string similarity methods,
 which this research proposes to extend by enriching the recorded features
 with additional place information such as place URIs, coordinates, and country indicators. Based on a case study at the Dutch Centre for Genealogy,
 this research contributes to extending entity resolution research, optimizing and enriching family history (meta) studies, and investigating which
 privacy-sensitive passport request documents can be disclosed.

First, linked open data sources are shown to retrieve unique place entities belonging to recorded place names. Second, place, province and country
 name similarities are calculated as well as coordinate distances within a coordinate reference system that limits the distance distortions for the respective
 countries. Third, the researched adaptation is shown to result in a significant
 change in similarity values when a uniform weighting of feature similarities
 is applied. However, contrary to the hypothesis, the similarity distributions
 of compared documents that do and do not refer to an equivalent person
entity could not be distinguished in a more accurate way. Hence, future
 studies are proposed that expand on this research by supervised learning of
 weights and thresholds using validated candidate links from this research."
The use of boundary spanning objects in Digital Transformation projects,"['Warmerdam, Fiep']","['Weerd, Inge van de']",2022-09-09T00:01:29Z,EN,"['boundary spanning, boundary spanner, boundary spanning objects, boundary spanning artifacts, digital transformation, digital transformation projects, IT consultancy, Anderson MacGyver']",Business Informatics,"The completion of projects that are carried out across multiple fields of an organization depends on the ability to span the boundaries between these fields. This also applies to digital transformation projects. Nowadays, the IT infrastructure of an organization is becoming more essential for the functioning of the organization. This leads to more organizations that are concerned about their digital side. Organizations tend to set up digital transformation projects to improve their IT infrastructure to a better fit for their organization. Therefore, they need practical tools to support the digital transformation process and create a common vision across stakeholders. This research describes how the Operating Model Canvas (OMC) and the Business Activity Model (BAM) serve as boundary spanning objects in digital transformation projects. To be able to do this, a literature study on boundary spanning and a comparative case study with digital transformation projects was conducted. The OMC and BAM can support boundary spanning activities in digital transformation projects by ensuring there is someone on the client's side that will take on a boundary spanning role and propagates the OMC and the BAM within the rest of the company. Other contributing factors are the urgency of the problem related to the assignment and the open attitude towards the project of all stakeholders."
Sleeping With the Enemy: Water Cooperation Between Israel and Jordan,"['Jong, Eline de']","['Boomgaard, Petra van den']",2022-09-09T00:01:17Z,EN,['Israel; Jordan; transboundary water cooperation; securitization theory'],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"Jordan and Israel share a history of conflict. Despite their differences, the countries have always managed to cooperate on issues of security and water. This thesis studies the water cooperation between Jordan and Israel. It researches why Jordan and Israel, two (former) enemies, cooperate on water, and how this cooperation results in mutual securitization. To answer this research question, securitization theory is used. This thesis makes an original contribution to securitization theory. The theory primarily focuses on how a state securitizes an existential threat, whereas this thesis argues two states can also securitize together. To analyze the securitization of the water sector in the two countries, water strategies of both governments are examined. In these reports one can find justifications for cooperation. This study finds that Jordan wishes to cooperate with Israel to increase its supply, which is crucial since it is in dire need for water. Israel wants to cooperate with Jordan since it benefits from a strong and stable Jordanian state, and cooperation would help achieve its sustainability goals. Thus, through cooperation, Jordan and Israel securitize together whilst having different securitizing goals."
Teachers’ Learning Challenges and Perspectives in the Online Environment during the Covid-19 Pandemic: Hybrid Teaching,"['Bernaards, Bas']","['Ben Shalom, Anna']",2022-09-09T00:01:22Z,EN,"['Phenomenology, Pandemic, Higher Education, Hybrid Teaching']",Educational Sciences,"When the COVID-19 virus spread across the world, countries had to deal with its consequences and put restrictions into effect. As a result, in The Netherlands schools and universities were either fully or partially closed. Especially higher educational institutions had to change their didactical methods and hybrid teaching was proposed to ensure the continuance of education. However, not much research has been done focussing on the perspective of teachers regarding this method. This study therefore aimed to investigate teachers’ experiences with and attitudes towards hybrid teaching. Purposive sampling was used to gather participants. Within a phenomenological research, multiple semi-structured interviews were conducted among teachers at (applied) universities. Data was gathered and analysed in NVivo.  Results show that teachers are critical towards hybrid teaching. Proper equipment and training is recommended if hybrid teaching is executed. However, this research found that hybrid teaching leads to a decrease in teacher motivation, an increase in teacher workload and a lack of community-building. Therefore, it is recommended that hybrid teaching is only implemented if necessary."
Inducing Challenge and Threat States: Effects on Learning and Self-Assessment Accuracy after Performance Feedback,"['Lambermont, Janne']","['Janssen, Eva']",2022-09-09T00:01:24Z,EN,['BPSM; challenge and threat states; learning from feedback; self-assessment accuracy'],Educational Sciences,"There is much variability of the effects of performance feedback on learning and self- assessment. The Biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat aims to explain the variabilities, through responses to emotions and stress. This paper conducted research to investigate if inducing a challenge or threat state affected one’s learning and self-assessment after receiving feedback. A math lesson was created on enlargement and reduction of shapes for students of the pabo Rotterdam. The instruction of the lesson manipulated participants into a challenge or threat state. The t-test results showed no significant results for both learning and self-assessment. A mediation effect was analyzed through a relative challenge measurement. Results of the mediation analysis indicated no direct or indirect effect of relative challenge on learning and self-assessment. Even though no significant results were found, a study has potential if the sample size could be increased, and a motivated performance situation could be set for the participants."

The two types of perfectionism were self-oriented perfectionism and socially prescribed perfectionism. The main goal of the research was to examine whether leader member exchange (LMX) operates as a mediator between perfectionism and social disconnection. To examine this, two mediation analysis were conducted on the data from 88 participants. Most of the participants were recruited from the company Univé Stad & Land (USL). The results showed significant direct effects for both types of perfectionism on social disconnection as well as a significant effect of LMX on social disconnection and a significant effect of socially prescribed perfectionism on LMX. Concerning the mediation, the results showed that LMX was only a significant mediator between socially prescribed perfectionism and social disconnection. The results indicate that LMX has an important effect on social disconnection in the workplace and that enhancing LMX with socially prescribed perfectionists could help them reducing their feelings of social disconnection at work. Limitations and directions for future research are further discussed."
Decentralisaties van belangenbehartiging van het sociaal domein: maatwerk of moeilijkheid?,"['Samwel, Jessie']","['Damhuis, Koen']",2022-09-09T01:00:48Z,NL,['niet-gekozen vertegenwoordigers; responsiviteit;  representatieve claims; decentralisaties sociaal domein; lokale belangenbehartiging; democratische vernieuwing; patiëntenparticipatie; patiëntenorganisaties.'],Bestuur en beleid,"In dit exploratieve onderzoek wordt de relatie onderzocht tussen schaalverkleining en de responsiviteit 
van belangenorganisaties die binnen het sociaal domein actief zijn, als niet-gekozen vertegenwoordigers. Hierbij luidt de hoofvraag van dit onderzoek: ‘Hoe hebben de decentralisaties van het sociaal domein invloed gehad op de manier waarop belangenorganisaties in het sociaal domein responsief zijn naar hun achterban toe?’. Hierbij zijn patiëntenorganisaties, specifiek de casus van de patiëntenorganisatie ReumaNederland, bestudeerd als casus voor het beantwoorden van de hoofdvraag. 

Om antwoord te krijgen op deze hoofdvraag is in dit onderzoek allereerst bestudeerd of er een verschil zit tussen wat patiëntenorganisaties vóór en na de decentralisaties namens hun achterban zeggen, door de ‘representatieve claims’, bewering van representatie (Saward, 2006), die zij in documenten en berichten maken te vergelijken. In het tweede deel wordt vanuit documenten en interviews met ReumaNederland en zes lokale reumaverenigingen die zijn aangesloten bij ReumaNederland, onderzocht welke manieren van het realiseren van responsiviteit ReumaNederland kende vóór en na de decentralisaties en welk effect de decentralisaties hebben gehad op deze responsiviteit. Responsiviteit gaat in dit onderzoek over de manieren waarop patiëntenorganisaties contacten onderhouden met hun achterban en daarmee informatie ophalen over waar hun achterban tegenaan loopt binnen de samenleving. Verschillende manieren om responsiviteit te realiseren kunnen worden ingezet om congruentie te garanderen tussen wat deze organisaties zeggen en doen en de belangen en behoeften van de personen die zij beogen te vertegenwoordigen.

Met de bevindingen draagt dit onderzoek bij aan een breder wetenschappelijk debat over niet-gekozen vertegenwoordigers als belangrijke actoren voor democratische vernieuwing. Deze niet-gekozen vertegenwoordigers worden volgens de bestuurskundige literatuur gezien als mogelijke vertegenwoordigers van groepen burgers die binnen de representatieve democratie ondervertegenwoordigd zijn (Denters et al, 2018, p. 19). Op deze manier zouden zij de lokale democratie versterken. Dit onderzoek draagt bij aan dit vraagstuk door het effect van schaalverkleining, namelijk de decentralisaties van sociaal domein in 2015, op de responsiviteit van patiëntenorganisaties naar hun achterban toe te bestuderen. Hieruit wordt duidelijk of patiëntenorganisaties sinds de decentralisaties de transitie hebben kunnen maken naar vertegenwoordiger op lokaal niveau. Naast wetenschappelijke bijdragen worden ook maatschappelijke inzichten verworven over welke voorwaarden er voor belangenorganisaties binnen het sociaal domein van belang zijn, om hun achterban ook op lokaal niveau te kunnen 
vertegenwoordigen."
Een beter stuur voor de KNWU,"['Noij, Chris']","['Roest, Jan-Willem van der']",2022-09-09T00:03:22Z,NL,['Democratie; slagvaardheid'],Sportbeleid en sportmanagement,"De structuur van de KNWU is verouderd, te complex en de lijnen lopen niet meer zoals deze 
bedoeld zijn (KNWU, 2021a). De KNWU heeft vernieuwing en verbetering nodig om 
slagvaardiger en democratischer te besturen. In de sportwereld is steeds meer aandacht voor 
de manier van besturen. Ontwikkelingen in de samenleving dwingen sportbonden als de 
KNWU in te spelen op de actualiteit en snel en efficiënt te werk te gaan. Op basis van het werk 
van de werkgroep structuur heeft het hoofdbestuur een nieuwe strategie en een aantal 
structuurveranderingen voorgelegd aan de leden om als wielerunie vitaal, inspirerend en 
relevant te zijn. Eén van de structuurveranderingen is het vervangen van een bestuurlijke laag 
van acht districten voor vier regio’s. Daarnaast wordt het hoogste beslisorgaan de ledenraad 
in plaats van het congres. Het doel van de KNWU is de getrapte democratie te vervangen door 
directe vertegenwoordiging middels de regio’s. De nieuwe ledenraad wordt kleiner om 
discussie te stimuleren en er is minder plaats voor belangenbehartiging. In dit onderzoek 
wordt onderzocht hoe deze voorgenomen structuurveranderingen bijdragen aan het 
slagvaardiger en democratischer worden van de KNWU. 
De nadruk van dit onderzoek ligt op het daadkrachtiger worden en beter inrichten van de 
vertegenwoordiging van sportorganisaties. De basis daarvan ligt bij goed bestuur. Vanuit 
NOC*NSF hebben sportorganisaties de verplichting bezig te zijn met transparantie, 
maatschappelijke betrokkenheid en democratie. Inbreng en inspraak van belanghebbenden is 
cruciaal om tot gedragen besluiten te komen. Uit onderzoek van Geeraert (2018a) naar de 
principes van goed bestuur bleek dat op het gebied van democratie nog het meeste te winnen 
valt bij Nederlandse sportorganisaties. Democratie is onder te verdelen in participatie, 
representativiteit en deliberatie (Carrio et al., 2021). Op basis van interviews en focusgroepen 
wordt onderzocht hoe de leden deze drie vormen terug zien bij de KNWU. Het is een 
interpretatief onderzoek waarbij de mening van interne stakeholders bij de KNWU en 
verenigingsbestuurders centraal staat.
De interne stakeholders ervaren de KNWU als een conservatieve, elitaire organisatie waar 
mensen veel op hun plek blijven zitten waardoor het doorvoeren van veranderingen 
moeizaam gaat. Door de vele overlegorganen is de werkwijze complex en niet efficiënt. De 
leden voelen zich niet altijd gehoord – bijvoorbeeld als het gaat om de aandacht voor 
breedtesport – en een uitlaatklep voor hun onvrede ontbreekt. Meer directe communicatie 
en zichtbaarheid van de KNWU kan dit verhelpen. Slagvaardig werken wordt door de interne 
stakeholders boven een democratische vertegenwoordiging geplaatst. In de nieuwe structuur 
is meer ruimte voor participatie. Het is goed dat het systeem van getrapte democratie wordt 
veranderd. Representativiteit is voor de leden niet het belangrijkst. De vertegenwoordiging 
hoeft niet representatief wanneer hun behoeften maar worden vervuld. De praktijk staat 
centraal, maar het noemen van concrete behoeften is moeilijk. De meeste winst valt te 
behalen op het gebied van deliberatieve democratie. Door meer jonge vrijwilligers te 
betrekken en de mogelijkheden tot inspraak te duiden kan meer worden gedaan met de 
mening van de leden, zonder dat dit voor extra bureaucratie hoeft te zorgen. Het wiel moet 
niet opnieuw worden uitgevonden, maar de structuur in theorie werkt niet in de praktijk 
waardoor ontwikkelingen langzaam gaan en de vertegenwoordiging niet voldoende is."
Effect of vegetation on evolving channel patterns in experimental salt marshes,"['Rossius, Jan-Eike']","['Kleinhans, Maarten']",2022-09-09T01:00:56Z,EN,['Salt marsh; Biogeomorphology; Flume experiments; Colonisation pattern; Patches; Biogeomorphic feedbacks'],Earth Surface and Water,"Salt marshes are highly valuable habitats and offer many important ecosystem services. They protect
the coast from erosion and serve as pollution filters and nursery ground for fish. Furthermore,
they are capable of storing a very high amount of carbon in a relatively short time. Their protection
and restoration is therefore crucial for the mitigation of global warming. Salt marshes are shaped
by a variety of biogeomorphic feedbacks which depend on many different biotic and abiotic aspects.
In order to clarify the conditions needed for such biogeomorphic interactions and the effect of different
vegetation colonisation patterns on it, four scaled landscape experiments were conducted in
the tidal flume ""The Metronome"". Two experiments were unvegetated control experiments and
two included vegetation. In one of these, the seeds were spread by the flowing water and in the
other, circular patches were sown and expanded manually at random locations.
Vegetation focused the flow more effectively and led to a split-up into several channels further
from the inlet, resulting in a longer and straighter main channel and an overall further landward
expansion of the system. Despite these clear morphological differences, quantitative measures of
the system, like eroded volume or drainage density, were very similar in all experiments, showing
that these are mainly shaped by the hydrodynamic boundary conditions and that the experiments
are very comparable.
The vegetation-induced morphological differences described above were more pronounced in the
experiment with hydrochorous seed spreading than in the experiment with patchy seeding. This
is a result of the patch locations being pre-determined randomly. This disables the biogeomorphic
feedback between low flow velocities and vegetation establishment, causing further reduction of
flow velocities. The completeness of this positive feedback loop is crucial for the emergence of a
self-organised landscape. Even though the patches were very dense and covered a larger area of
the system than the vegetation in the experiment with hydrochorous seed spreading, they were not
able to foster the evolution of a self-organised landscape in a similar way.
Only locally, the patches sometimes had strong biogeomorphic effects. Their density enables them
to show such effects, like the stabilisation of features or the initiation of channels around them, very
clearly, but only if they are in the locally favourable position for that. Since this was not the case
everywhere, the overall morphology in the experiment with patchy seeding was less self-organised
and more similar to the unvegetated control experiments even though the biogeomorphic feedbacks
were more pronounced in some locations. The feedback loops of biogeomorphic feedbacks thus
need to be complete to enable the emergence of a fully self-organised landscape."

Especially in difficult and abstract chemistry education, using games can facilitate chemistry learning for students. Immersive environments create a strong sense of presence in students, which ultimately leads to higher engagement and motivation and deeper cognitive processing of learning material. With this study, we try to find out whether there is a positive relationship between level of immersion and cognition and motivation. In addition, it is investigated whether sense of presence can act as a mediator in the relationship.

A total of 36 participants were asked to participate in the experiment. During the experiment, participants filled out pre-and post-questionnaires and knowledge tests to see whether the level of immersion influences students' cognition and motivation. In addition, it was tested whether the relationship between level of immersion and cognition and motivation is mediated by sense of presence. A multiple regression analysis via the Baron and Kenny method was performed. The data gathered in this study suggest that only the relationship between immersion and sense of presence is significant. For this reason, all hypotheses were rejected, except for hypothesis 3."
"Assessing Credibility in Online Sexual Health Information based on the level of Readability, Sensational Tone and the use of Dutch Swearing Words","['Luna Sernandez, Esther']","['Veltkamp, Remco']",2022-09-09T01:00:59Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"Today, for most adolescents the use of social networking sites plays a major role in their lives. However, the great level of accessibility to these networking sites makes it very easy for anyone to publish information related to sexual health information, risking spreading misinformation and low-quality facts. Thus, to improve the quality of sexual health information shared online and help young people to differentiate it from deceptive information, the present research analyses markers that are linked to the degree of information credibility such as the level of readability, the tone of speech, and the use of swearing words. The information concerning sexual health issues has been retrieved from Fok.nl Forum – accounting for a total of 9150 comments previously divided into five different sexual topics. Besides, seven categories of Dutch swearing words have been created. 
First, with the proportions of swearing categories per topic, a one-way ANOVA was implemented to see whether there are statistically significant differences across all topics. Furthermore, the readability measure of Gobbledygook was applied to test the level of readability per topic. Lastly, several statistical tests such as Chi-square of Independence, Cramer’s V, Goodman and Kruskal Lambda, and the Uncertainty Coefficient were implemented to see whether the topics are statistically independent of one another regarding the tone of speech. This research has found that comments that talk about sexual experiences have a significantly lower readability score compared to the rest of the topics. Along with this, swearing words related to illnesses, feces, sexuality, and homophobic and sexist slurs have a statistically significant different distribution in occurrence among all topics. Lastly, it has been found that there is no statistical difference in terms of the sensational and negative tone between the sexual health topics. Regarding further research, the level of toxicity and the analysis of slang concerning sexual health information are recommended to consider."

The data was gathered from three separate data sets – one being a synthetic PaySim dataset, the second one provided by Vesta in cooperation with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the third one related to Bitcoin transactions. In all cases, exploratory analysis is applied to attempt to gain an initial overview of the data sets and presumably to identify certain characteristics which can serve to find additional methods for fraud detection. The data are analyzed using graph-based approaches which allows for retrieving centrality metrics for different classes of nodes indicating if they are involved in fraudulent activity or not. The outcomes were examined using goodness of fit analysis and descriptive statistics measures to determine if there are differences between groups of observations. At a general level of metrics distribution in different observation classes, Mann-Whitney U test was employed. Finally, Louvain modularity was used to gather information regarding dense communities which can constitute fraud rings. The results of this study suggest that some of the methods presented in this paper can be useful, however, precise, non-anonymized data must be provided to prove their efficacy. In all our experiments, the centrality metrics did not perform well for predicting fraud. Without additional information on the entity making a transaction it is not possible to flag potentially suspicious nodes accurately."

Echter zijn deze kwantitatief van aard, gaan niet in op fysieke omgevingsfactoren en richten zich enkel op grootschalige openbare ruimtes. Dit terwijl kleinschalige openbare ruimtes op buurtniveau minstens zo belangrijk zijn omdat deze onderdeel zijn van de directe leefomgeving van mensen. Het doel van deze thesis is om inzicht te geven in de rol van de fysieke inrichting en het beheer van de openbare ruimte op buurtniveau bij de ontwikkeling van het eigenaarschapsgevoel over deze ruimte. Twee openbare ruimtes in Deventer vormen hierbij de onderzoeksgebieden. Voor het onderzoek is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Hoe zijn de fysieke inrichting van het Werklustplein en de Molentuin en het beheer ervan van invloed op het eigenaarschapsgevoel van buurtbewoners? 

Om de onderzoeksvraag te kunnen beantwoorden is kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd. Door middel van documentenanalyse en interviews is inzicht verkregen in hoe beide locaties worden beheerd. De fysieke inrichting en het ruimtegebruik zijn onderzocht aan de hand van observatie, fotodocumentatie en -analyse. Om erachter te komen hoe de fysieke inrichting van de openbare ruimte en het beheer ervan van invloed is op het eigenaarschapsgevoel van buurtbewoners zijn diepte-interviews gehouden.

Uit het kwalitatieve onderzoek is gebleken dat er een iteratief proces, een wisselwerking, bestaat tussen de fysieke inrichting van een ruimte, het beheer en gebruik ervan en het eigenaarschapsgevoel. Hoewel er meerdere elementen in de fysieke inrichting en het onderhoud te onderscheiden zijn die bijdragen aan het eigenaarschapsgevoel, blijken dat voor en tijdens gebiedsontwikkeling en in de manier van onderhoud, juist de sociale processen hierin (tussen bewoners onderling en tussen bewoners en bijvoorbeeld de gemeente) de grootste invloed hebben op het eigenaarschapsgevoel. Er is een onderverdeling te maken van drie componenten; het fysieke component, het sociale/participatie component en het onderhoudscomponent. Deze componenten zijn verwerkt in een zelfontwikkeld model dat als conclusie dient van dit onderzoek.

Dit onderzoek heeft zich uitsluitend gericht op factoren binnen de fysieke inrichting en het beheer van openbare ruimtes. Omdat er meerdere factoren van invloed zijn op het eigenaarschapsgevoel, kan er geen algemene uitspraak worden gedaan over factoren die zich niet richten op fysieke inrichting en beheer. Daarnaast betreft het eigenaarschapsgevoel een gevoel, wat per persoon verschilt. De uitkomsten van dit onderzoek kunnen daarom niet eenvoudigweg worden gegeneraliseerd naar andere locaties. Wel geeft dit onderzoek richtlijnen mee die informatief kunnen zijn voor andere locaties en stappen die in dit onderzoeksproces genomen zijn, kunnen worden toegepast op soortgelijk onderzoek naar andere locaties. 

Door meer soortgelijk onderzoek uit te voeren naar kleinschalige openbare ruimtes kan gesteld worden of dezelfde conclusies kunnen worden getrokken. Ook zou vervolgonderzoek zich kunnen richten op andere factoren van invloed op het eigenaarschapsgevoel, bijvoorbeeld persoonlijke factoren. Daarnaast blijkt uit dit onderzoek dat onderlinge connecties tussen buurtbewoners het eigenaarschapsgevoel beïnvloeden. Hoe en in welke mate zou nader onderzocht kunnen worden. De belangrijkste aanbeveling voor de gemeente is om, voordat (her)inrichtings- of onderhoudsprocessen van start gaan, eerst te richten op de sociale context in de buurt en rondom de betreffende openbare ruimte en participatietrajecten goed vorm te geven. Alleen wanneer hiermee rekening wordt gehouden, hebben elementen in de fysieke inrichting en het onderhoud positieve invloed op het eigenaarschapsgevoel."
Socio-technical transitions and justice: A study on containerization and justice in the Port of Rotterdam,"['Kolkman, Jelle']","['Meelen, Toon']",2022-09-09T01:04:24Z,EN,[],Innovation Sciences,"This research describes how justice and injustice for dockworkers developed during the social-technical regime transition from the breakbulk regime to the container regime in the Port of Rotterdam. Hereby contributing to our understanding of the relationship between justice and socio-technical transitions. The study joins theories from transition and justice literature, using the Multi-Level Perspective and three-justice tenets, distributional, procedural and recognition justice, to create a preliminary conceptual framework. This framework allows the researcher to describe the development of justice and injustice during a regime transition. Using this framework, a literature analysis of secondary data and semi-structured expert interviews were conducted. This data was coded to generate a database that allowed for a process-tracing approach which was used to construct a historical case study.

The traditional breakbulk regime was characterized by a unique set of justice and injustice, primarily tied to the work environment. These unique dynamics in the workspace and breakbulk companies created a unique dockworkers' culture, which resulted in high unionization rates. When the container entered the port, the distribution of jobs shifted due to job decreases in the breakbulk. In addition, container companies hiring procedures didn’t’ give traditional dockworkers equal chances due to their cultural alignment.  However, because unionization rates were high, dockworkers could organize sizeable collective actions to influence procedures in the port.  These actions prevented most forced lay-offs and successfully pressured actors to agree to sectorial solutions for the growing labour abundance. By the end of the transition, work in the general cargo had changed dramatically. Due to standardization opportunities, work at the container terminals was more monotonous but came with higher pay and strong secondary labour conditions. This is partially the result of continuous collective actions by dockworkers, who still pertain considerable similarities to the 1960s culture. The case study shows the use of the conceptual framework to assess the development of justice and injustice during a transition. Three theoretical processes were deducted: the process of cultural exclusion, of justice-induced strategy change and of virtuous justice cycles, thereby refining the conceptual framework. Avenues for further research are the phase-out of the coal regime, especially the more finalized transition in Germany and ongoing in Australia. Additionally,  this research shows the benefits of a collective sectorial labour pool to deal with sudden shocks in labour demand and the role of organized labour in limiting and tackling injustices."

Early visual cortex areas exhibit monotonically increasing responses to visual event timing, turning into timing-tuned responses beginning in the medial temporal area (MT/V5). Here, we investigate whether such responses can be found in recurrent generative neural network models, unsupervisedly trained to efficiently encode visual event timing. Utilizing biologically plausible learning rules, as well as network structure, we were able to find monotonic and tuned responses to visual event timing in non-hierarchical- but not in hierarchical models. Thus, supporting the emergence of monotonic and tuned responses from inherent components of visual inputs. We showed that unsupervised recurrent generative neural networks can generally be used as models for human visual event timing. Moreover, we propose that advanced models could contribute explaining the response development along the visual hierarchy or the relationship between spatial and temporal abstraction."

Variables that are used in North American and Australian Walkability Indices (WIs) may not be directly applicable to a European context. To find the most suitable walkability index for Amsterdam, this study uses a review of related work, a comparison of the three chosen walkability indices, two types of sensitivity analysis, a regression analysis, and a correlation analysis. The regression analysis pointed out that the Urban Walkability Index has the largest share of explained variance out of all three existing Walkability Index models that were compared; the Graz Walkability Index and Frank’s Walkability Index were found to be less suitable. In this study, a walkability index is constructed especially for the context of Amsterdam. This Amsterdam Walkability Index turns out to be the most suitable walkability index for predicting walking behavior in Amsterdam, since 30.6% of variance in mean walking distance per postal code area can be ascribed to the index."
Development Dialogues: Chinese Development In Africa and The British Media,"['Gallagher, Iain']","['Dittgen, Romain']",2022-09-09T01:04:19Z,EN,['Development; China; Africa; British Media; Investment; Bias; Framing; Journalism'],International Development Studies,"Chinese development stories from Africa have frequently appeared in the British media in recent years bringing these Chinese development efforts into the public eye. This research paper seeks to examine Chinese development in Africa, its portrayal in the British media and its ultimate effect on development dialogues. The aim of the research is to build on the work of Mawdsley (2008) and establish changes in the dialogue since their study was conducted.  It argues that Chinese development is often subjected to framing which leads to unjustified criticism by approaching this topic from a UK-centric position in the media. By utilising a content analysis examining quantitatively and qualitatively, an understanding of the British print media sphere regarding Chinese development in Africa was garnered. Further interviews with journalists shed further light on this topic and highlighted the shortcomings of the UK media when examining development. This paper finds that the lack of critical engagement regarding Chinese development in Africa ultimately stifles development dialogue by taking such a UK-centric perspective to a topic which should ultimately incorporate a more inclusive approach giving voice to African interests."

Leefbaarheid in bloemkoolwijken: Een onderzoek naar de relatie tussen stedenbouwkundige kenmerken en leefbaarheid in wijken uit 1970-1985,"['Koch, Matthijs']","['Bolt, Gideon']",2022-09-09T02:02:06Z,NL,['Bloemkoolwijken; leefbaarheid; stedenbouwkundige kenmerken;  indicatoren van leefbaarheid; woonerven; groeikernen'],Human Geography,"Bloemkoolwijken zijn gebouwd in een periode van grootschalige stedelijke groei in Nederland (1970-1985). Hoewel schattingen over het exacte aantal uiteenlopen, kan gesteld worden dat een aanzienlijk aantal Nederlanders in een bloemkoolwijk woont. Bewoners lijken redelijk tevreden over hun woonomgeving, maar beweringen van stedenbouwkundigen, beleidsmakers en onderzoekers dat de leefbaarheid achteruit gaat in deze wijken moeten serieus genomen worden. 

Omdat het begrip leefbaarheid erg abstract is, kan de relatie tussen stedenbouwkundig ontwerp en leefbaarheid worden onderzocht door niet alleen te kijken naar leefbaarheid als geheel, maar door te focussen op enkele indicatoren van leefbaarheid. Ontwerpers van bloemkoolwijken hebben geprobeerd om een aantal aspecten van leefbaarheid direct te beïnvloeden. In theorie zouden bloemkoolwijken dus beter scoren dan wijken waar niet geprobeerd werd deze aspecten bewust te beïnvloeden. Maar is dit ook zo? En welke ontwerpkenmerken zorgen hier dan voor? Dit is onderzocht aan de hand van de vraag: Wat is de invloed van stedenbouwkundige kenmerken van bloemkoolwijken op indicatoren van leefbaarheid en hoe kunnen verschillen in leefbaarheid, zowel met andere wijken als tussen bloemkoolwijken onderling, worden verklaard?

Om data te verzamelen en onderzoeksgroepen te maken zijn ruim zevenhonderd wijken uit de periode 1970-1985 individueel getoetst op zes stedenbouwkundige kenmerken van bloemkoolwijken. Deze zijn: organisatie rondom woonerven; woonerven onderling verbonden middels voet- en fietspaden; slingerende wegenstructuur; doorgaand verkeer via ringweg of hoofdontsluiting; vertakkingen met doodlopende straten; integratie van groen. Deze toetsing resulteerde in drie groepen: bloemkoolwijken (met vijf of zes kenmerken), controlewijken (met drie of minder kenmerken) en een tussencategorie (met exact vier kenmerken). Bij een vergelijking van wijken uit dezelfde bouwperiode zijn een aantal eigenschappen overeenkomstig, zoals bouwkwaliteit en locatie, en verschillen de groepen op stedenbouwkundige kenmerken. 

Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat het niet slecht gesteld is met bloemkoolwijken. Gebaseerd op metingen van de Leefbaarometer scoren bloemkoolwijken iets onder het Nederlands gemiddelde, maar tonen bloemkoolwijken een betere leefbaarheidsscore dan andere wijken uit dezelfde periode. De ontwikkeling van deze score door de jaren heen is ook nog eens gunstiger dan van andere wijken uit dezelfde periode en de gemiddelde Nederlandse buurt. 
De onderzochte indicatoren van leefbaarheid (verkeersveiligheid, beweging, kindvriendelijkheid, eenzaamheid en overlast) geven echter maar een beperkte verklaring voor de verschillen met controlewijken. Stedenbouwkundigen hebben geprobeerd deze vijf indicatoren te beïnvloeden met  hun ontwerp, maar desondanks scoren bloemkoolwijken niet uitsluitend gunstiger op deze indicatoren.
	Een zorgelijk signaal is het relatief hoge aantal wegongevallen in bloemkoolwijken. Ondanks dat dat verkeersveiligheid een van de belangrijkste uitgangspunten bij het ontwerp van bloemkoolwijken was, blijkt het tegenovergestelde in de praktijk. Daarnaast wijst dit onderzoek op de relatief slechte leefbaarheidsscores van bloemkoolwijken in groeikernen. In veel groeikernen zijn er meerdere bloemkoolwijken. Aangezien er veel wijken in eenzelfde gemeente kunnen kampen met problemen, is ook hier extra aandacht noodzakelijk.
	De verbanden tussen stedenbouwkundige kenmerken en leefbaarheidsindicatoren zijn om landelijke schaal onderzocht. (Kwalitatief) onderzoek op een kleiner schaalniveau wordt aangeraden om deze verbanden nader te onderzoeken."
A stakeholder perspective on overcoming governance gaps in order to create a climate-adapted landscape at the Utrechtse Heuvelrug,"['Ruijtenberg, Naomi']","['Dermody, Brian']",2022-09-09T02:02:03Z,EN,['Climate adaptation; social-ecological systems; governance gaps; national park Utrechtse Heuvelrug'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"National Park Utrechtse Heuvelrug is a nature area that currently faces many challenges related to climate change. Climate adaptation (CA) is required to ensure that the Utrechtse Heuvelrug (UH) can fulfil its current functions relating to recreation, nature conservation, living, drinking water etc. This CA transition involves various stakeholders, who already play a role. However, the implementation of CA solutions proceeds slowly. This thesis researches the social-ecological system (SES) of the UH to analyse what acceleration possibilities exist for the transition towards a climate-adapted landscape.

This was done by conducting an actor-issue network analysis, which provides insight into the interconnectedness of actors and/or climate issues. The network was complemented by a power-interest matrix, showing the different levels of power and interest held by stakeholders, and by a PESTEL-analysis, which is a strategic planning tool that helps define key drivers for change (KDFC). The network and the power-interest matrix were developed based on data collected through desk research and 22 interviews. The PESTEL-analysis resulting in the KDFC was based on two workshops with relevant stakeholders. 

12 KDFC were identified to accelerate the transition towards a climate-adapted landscape at the UH: 1) Set priorities and frameworks, 2) Strengthen governmental leadership (“regie”), 3) Invest in CSR, 4) Stakeholders should better argue what benefits their solution has, 5) Combine functions and always consider CA, 6) Work from intrinsic motivation, 7) Increasingly connect other stakeholders and boost CA solutions, 8) Seize opportunities, 9) Prioritise long-term solutions, 10) Establish an overarching research direction: measuring and monitoring, 11) Increase the capacity of municipalities, and 12) Better substantiate why stakeholders believe a project should proceed.

These results apply to the UH and while some KDFC may be useful to other national parks, the results cannot directly be generalised, due to different governance structures and climate issues. Implementing the KDFC can help to accelerate the transition toward a climate-adapted landscape. Various stakeholders have been identified to be responsible for implementing one or more KDFC. However, in the end, it is up to all stakeholders to collaboratively take responsibility in this transition."
Towards Inclusivity: Virtual Reality Museums for the Visually Impaired,"['Zaal, Tycho']","['Akdag, Almila']",2022-09-09T02:02:00Z,EN,"['Visually impaired, virtual reality, museum, art, blind, gamification']",Game and Media Technology,"Visually impaired (VI) adolescents often partake less in leisure activities, such as visiting cinemas, theatres, and museums, than their sighted peers. Art can play an important role in developing the intellectual and personal growth of young people. As such, ensuring that the visually impaired have access to museums and their art from a young age is especially important. Technologies such as virtual reality provide users easy access to virtual content. These technologies often rely on ordinary visual interfaces, meaning the visually impaired do not have (unrestricted) access to them. This thesis aims to develop an altered version of a virtual reality museum that can be adequately experienced by visually impaired teenagers. 

The virtual reality museum consists of historic figures and artifacts, which can be interacted with to prompt animations, sound effects, or narrative voice-lines. A between-subjects study was designed in order to explore if narrations and spatialized 'reference' audio combined with haptic feedback is a sufficient replacement for the traditional use of vision. Alongside the visually impaired and the sighted version, a blindfolded version was created, which blocks all vision in its entirety and was played by several sighted participants to get supplementary data to that of the visually impaired. 

Although significant differences were found in the mean accuracy of each of the three versions, all three participant groups managed to successfully interact with all virtual objects. The pace at which they did this was statistically equivalent, suggesting the adapted interaction method is just as fast to use, just slightly less accurate. An additional steering method was added for the visually impaired version, which uses auditory and haptic feedback to steer players towards specific virtual objects. This method allowed users to find objects even faster, but due to a lack of clear feedback was found to be somewhat confusing. Even though there was no statistical equivalence in audio understanding, presence, and understanding of the environment, the visually impaired participants positively graded these in the qualitative survey. As such, it can be concluded that even though the visually impaired did not have a fully statistically equivalent experience as the others, they were able to adequately experience the virtual reality museum."
Knowledge integration in urban climate citizen participation,"['Coevorden, Judith van']","['Friendly, Abigail']",2022-09-09T02:02:14Z,EN,['Citizen participation; Co-production; Knowledge integration capacity; Urban climate adaptation; disadvantaged communities'],Spatial Planning,"Being especially vulnerable for the consequences of climate change, cities worldwide are fully
engaged in developing strategies and policies regarding climate adaptation. Citizen participation
in urban climate adaptation projects is essential in the transition to sustainable cities. The
complexity of this transition requires the involvement of different perspectives and types of
knowledge. However, the challenge in participatory processes often lies in the knowledge
integration between citizens and experts. Literature emphasizes the importance of focussing on
process rather than outcome when it comes to participation. Several authors indicate the need of
developing participatory processes that ensure the actual integration of different types of
knowledge. This thesis therefore focuses on the relationship between citizen participation in the
process of plan-forming in planning projects regarding urban climate adaptation, and the capacity
for knowledge integration between citizens and experts in those projects. The research is
conducted by a case study research design with qualitative methods. By conducting both
document analysis and in-depth interviews, a comprehensive overview is provided of the
relationship between participation methods and knowledge integration capacity.

The results of this study demonstrate that the way in which capacity for knowledge integration
between citizens and experts is formed is closely related to the design of participation. A
recurring theme in the results is the importance of carefully organizing the participation process,
with the focus on that process itself rather than on its outcome. By structuring this process on the
basis of a number of important guidelines, capacity for knowledge integration between citizens
and experts is created. The most important guidelines concern the early involvement of citizens
so that their knowledge and interests are included from the start, building and maintaining
citizens' trust and creating an intensive collaboration between citizens and experts, bridging
differences in knowledge levels. In this way constructive conversations can take place in which
capacity for knowledge integration between citizens and experts is created.

A caveat to the research is that the focus on disadvantaged communities also poses a limitation
in the research. The reason for this limitation lies in the fact that poverty of citizens in
disadvantaged communities can form a barrier in their incentive to participate, due to prejudice
and stigmatization. When citizens did not participate in the investigated cases for this reason,
their voice was not heard in the interviews. In possible follow-up research, a more personal
approach to people could therefore be considered, in order to gain people's trust so that they dare
to speak out."
The Association Between Risk and Protective Factors and Caribbean Adolescents' Risk-Taking Behaviours,"['Halpin-Doyle, Lorena']","['Dubas, Judith']",2022-09-09T02:02:10Z,EN,['risk-taking; risk factors; protective factors; caribbean; adolescents'],Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology,"Adolescent risk-taking is of particular concern in the Caribbean, as individual and social problems are on the rise. To develop effective prevention and intervention programmes for these youth, it is imperative to understand the relationship between the factors which influence this behaviour. This study had five main purposes: the first three investigated the association between risk-taking and individual risk factors, social risk factors, and family protective factors respectively. The final two investigated whether family-related protective factors can buffer these associations. A 2-year longitudinal study was conducted in Sint Maarten. There were 378 adolescents who participated in Wave 1 and Wave 2, ranging from 11-19 years. Participants completed scales measuring; depression; behavioural disinhibition; peer attitudes; peer pressure; parental monitoring; parental support; and engagement in risk-taking. Results indicated both individual risk factors (depression and disinhibition) were significantly associated with risk-taking, however, both social risk factors (deviant peer attitudes and peer pressure) were not significantly associated with risk-taking. Additionally, the protective factor parental monitoring, significantly buffered the association between depression and risk-taking. These findings indicate that while individual risk factors are associated with adolescents’ increased risk-taking, family-based interventions which increase parental monitoring may be effective in reducing this risk-taking."

Unwritten Rules of Engagement: A case study into the negotiation of meritocratic norms and hardcore game values in and around Loserfruit’s Twitch streams,"['Bool, Pablo']","['Vught, Jasper van']",2022-09-09T02:02:12Z,EN,"['Loserfruit, meritocracy, toxicity, hardcore game culture, gamer identity, Twitch.']",New Media and Digital Culture,"In 2018 Christopher A. Paul wrote his book “The Toxic Meritocracy of Video Games” in 
which he highlights how the concept of meritocracy has latched itself on game culture,
promoting the isolation of skill and merit of the individual. However, this focus on merit then
 neglects the conditions of a marginalised community who face structural disadvantages and 
play catch-up due to increasing integration of meritocratic mechanics in games, raising the 
threshold of skill in playing video games. This research links Paul's explanation of meritocratic norms to how hardcore game culture integrated these norms in their creation of gamer identity. What does it mean to be a 
""real"" gamer and which strategies does one use? To expose conflicts of a meritocratic  hegemony in gaming a more defined case study of Kathleen “Loserfruit” Belsten will aid in analysing how meritocratic norms and hardcore game cultural values are negotiated in and around her Twitch streams and YouTube videos. This research of negotiation is carried out through the means of a critical discourse analysis (CDA) which utilises three sections (text, discursive practice and social practice). The interplay between these sections is used to disentangle and explain how the construct of discourse perpetuates a hegemonic structure. Due to the focus on agonistics the perspective of Chantal Mouffe and her ideas on the re-articulation of dominant perspective from a counter-hegemony are central in this discussion of a hegemonic struggle in gaming."

Focussing on the city of Utrecht, I have conducted participant led walking interviews through places of the participants’ choosing. The semi-structured interviews were held with 11 students from different non-urban areas in the Netherlands. Results revealed that the students with a non-urban background have a relative positive attachment to Utrecht, although the attachment and identity remain limited to the student community and facilities. Next to this, the length of residence and mobility of students are important moderators on the sense of place of the students. The conclusion is therefore that students with a non-urban background easily feel at home in Utrecht through the selfsegregation of students, even though this is of a temporary nature."

Outflow numbers are worrying and a recent government intervention meant to improve the situation did not have the desired effect.

This exploratory study made use of semi-structured interviews with SSE-teachers and YL-trainers (n = 16) by asking them: (1) what the added value of YL is to SSE; (2) What challenges need to be overcome; (3) And what changes need to be made in order to successfully implement YL in SSE. Conclusions of this study was that YL helped SSE-youth to reach their full potential and that YL can best be implemented when changes are made in consultation with specific schools due to the heterogeneous nature of SSE-youth. Future research should focus on which teaching methods would be most effective and should ideally include youth in their research population in order to provide a better fit with SSE-youth."
Greening the ‘green gold’: An analysis of the contribution of Rainforest Alliance certification in making the Mexican avocado sector more sustainable.,"['Kuipers, Anne']","['Westen, Guus van']",2022-09-09T02:04:16Z,EN,['Sustainability; private governance; private sustainability standards; agricultural certification standards; Rainforest Alliance; avocado cultivation; Mexico; theory-based evaluation'],International Development Studies,"Avocados are becoming increasingly popular among consumers. In response to the growing demand, the production of avocado is rapidly expanding. Over one-third of the avocados in the world are cultivated in Mexico, where there are considerable socioeconomic and environmental issues connected to the cultivation of the fruit. Effectively addressing these issues might cause the highly profitable avocado industry to have a positive effect on the socioeconomic development in Mexico. However, there is little research on how this could be achieved. In other sectors, certification standards have shown some promising results in increasing sustainability. While the number of certification standards in the Mexican avocado sector is proliferating, there has been no assessment of how they affect environmental and social outcomes at the farm level. This study sets out to address this research gap by focusing on Rainforest Alliance certification specifically. 

This thesis is embedded in wider theoretical debates on certification standards and private governance. Through a theory-based mixed-methods approach in which interviews, a survey, and an extensive literature review were integrated, it was evaluated how adoption and implementation of Rainforest Alliance certification by Mexican avocado producers contributes to more sustainable outcomes at the farm level. The results of this study indicate that the contribution of Rainforest Alliance certification in affecting farm practices related to the sustainability issues differs considerably between producers. Although the Rainforest Alliance-certified producers in this study implement sustainable farm practices, this does not always seem to be the result of Rainforest Alliance certification specifically. Other certification standards also seem to play a role in affecting such farm practices. It was found that most sustainability challenges in the Mexican avocado sector are addressed by the requirements of the Rainforest Alliance certification standard, and therefore seems to have the potential to increase sustainability in the sector. However, adoption of the standard is selective, as only larger, already better-performing producers seem to adopt the standard. To reach its full potential, adoption should be increased by minimising the barriers while enhancing the motivations of producers to adopt certification. It was found that market demand plays a key role in the adoption of certification schemes. Hence, the role buyers and consumers play in impacting production practices should not be underestimated. Moreover, increased partnership between key stakeholders is recommended."

From my position as a white, Western European gender studies student anchored in an urban landscape, my thesis traces the path of de/re/construction of my relationship to the body, asking the following question: In what ways have the observed practices and discourses of DESMI allowed me to understand a non-anthropocentric conception of the body? Based on field notes taken as an intern, and an analysis of them embedded in the Epistemologies of the South and inspired by the Grounded Method Theory, I explore a relational conception of the body as promoted by DESMI, which recognizes itself in the relationships to others, to the human and non-human elements that surround it. Accompanied by community feminism, and especially Julieta Paredes’ “5 fields of action and struggles of women from the communities” and Lorena Cabnal’s understanding of the “body-territory”, the analysis of my field notes draws out the ways in which a consciousness of one’s body in the world is deployed in the practices and discourses of DESMI. In a nutshell, three main ways are emphasized: the balancing of theory and practice that enables the building of embodied knowledge; the emphasis put on the collective in the construction of all kinds of autonomy; and the anchoring of our bodies in the diversity of temporalities and territories from which they cannot be withdrawn."

Bloodlines is an interdisciplinary virtual artistic exploration of the Chinese identity by six artists across the Sinosphere. The creative group searches for the promise of ""Chineseness"" as an individual, cultural, and international identity connecting different parts of the world. Bloodlines is initiated by Cinthia Chen (Taiwan- American) and Sim Yan Ying (Singapore), along with four other Chinese from Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and the US. This thesis maps the two major types of dramaturgies, New Media Dramaturgy and Dramaturgy of Migration, in attempt to establish a dramaturgical understanding of virtual migrant theatre. This thesis employs a theoretical framework that mentions the key authors across two fields, including Peter Eckersall, Steve Dixon, Yana Meerzon, Judith Rudakoff and Emma Cox. A dramaturgical analysis is conducted, following the relational approach proposed by Liesbeth Groot Nibbelink and Sigrid Merx. By employing the New Media Dramaturgy as a major composition strategy to foreground the migrant identities in virtual migrant theatre, I intend to develop a dramaturgical framework that contributes towards the understanding of the virtual migrant theatre. This is formed by connecting the relationships between virtual theatre and migrant identities-related issues and spectators. For my central case study, Bloodlines (2022), I conduct background research with contextual analysis regarding the performers’ in relations to the specific term “Chineseness”. This work contributes to the field of performance studies by drawing connections between virtual theatre, “Chineseness” and spectatorship, as a dramaturgical idea of virtual migrant theatre. This research thus aims to contribute towards the contemporary art field by suggesting another possible way of connecting the disconnected and communicating beyond the boundaries in order to give voice to the silenced."

Even though his dramatist work has been broadly researched, the existential elements in his plays Bus Stop and The Other Shore have received minor attention. Scholars have already hinted at the prospect of these two plays being analyzed from the perspective of existentialism – and they have explicitly declared his post-exile dramas to be existentialist – yet that has never fully developed into a complete theory. This thesis will present a new critical perspective on Gao’s selected pre-exile dramaturgy, by employing Hans van Stralen’s theory on literary existentialism and his two most salient concepts of existentialist, close-reading analysis: the three semantic topoi of existentialism (the limit situation, the other, and engagement) and three existential themes (enclosed space, authentic outsider, and negative/absent action). Using existential theory to read Gao’s plays, this thesis elaborates on how Gao’s unique adaptation of topoi and themes expands the existential concept, bringing the power dynamics of the collective to the fore and offering critical insight on the dimensionality of space. Ultimately, this will modify the Eurocentric character of existentialism and broaden it with the inclusion of Gaoist-inflected existential ideas."

Then, the SPSS analysis has been used to yield results. According to the results, this thesis gains the following main findings. First, both discounts and product innovation have significant impacts on customers purchase decisions, either for Starbucks or Luckin Coffee. Also, these consequences are consistent with part of hypothesis. Moreover, customer ethnocentrism has different impact on Starbucks and Luckin Coffee. In other words, customer ethnocentrism has a significant impact on customers’ purchase decisions in Luckin Coffee, but it almost has no impact on that of Starbucks. Thus, the results of this thesis suggest that there is some room for improvement in Starbucks' strategy, while Luckin Coffee's strategy is sufficiently appropriate.

- Maak gebruik van verschillende soorten teksten.
- Maak gebruik van praktische opdrachten waarin verschillende vaardigheden zijn geïntegreerd.
- Toets op vaardigheden in plaats van kennis.
- Zorg voor een motiverende en veilige leeromgeving.

The most important marketing strategies used to combat the encroaching threat of English-language counterparts to the sales of Dutch books are the creation of limited editions and community building, both on social media (which in 2022 is mostly Instagram and TikTok) and at literary events. The thesis contributes to filling a niche in scholarly research on marketing strategies used to sell translated YAL in the Dutch context, and offers insights into the world of publishers, editors and marketers, partly in their own words."
''INEQUALITY AVERSION'': A DISCUSSION OF THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN WORKERS AND MANAGERS WAGES AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE EVALUATIONS OF INVESTORS,"['Andreakis, Marios']","['Montone, Maurizio']",2022-09-09T02:04:09Z,EN,[],Banking and Finance,"In recent years, there has been a tendency to gradually increase the wage of CEOs, in contrast to those of employees who most often remain at the same or lower levels. In this dissertation, the inequality of wages between CEOs and employees in US companies was studied, as well as the impact of this inequality on the valuations of investors. For this purpose, data were collected for each company from all industries for the period 2017-2020 (due to the SEC reform that was activated in 2017). In particular, the Stock Returns of the US companies were studied and specifically to what extent they are related to the Pay Ratio, as well as to other control variables such as Price-to-book Ratio, Total Assets etc. Indeed, the study of empirical analysis showed that the company's Pay Ratio and the valuation are strongly correlated. There is also a link between Stock Returns and other control variables. In general, what emerges is a negative correlation which means that the wider the wage gap, the lower the valuation and returns of companies should be expected."

Speckle tracking analysis of the fetal heart in uncomplicated pregnancies and complicated pregnancies: a pilot study using FetalHQ,"['Oomkens, Michelle']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-09-09T03:02:18Z,EN,['Speckle tracking echocardiography; strain; fetus; diabetes mellitus; fetal growth restriction'],Selective Utrecht Medical Master (SUMMA),"Background: Strain imaging by speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) is a novel and promising ultrasound technique for a detailed evaluation of fetal cardiac function. It may contribute to the selection of high-risk patients with pregnancy complications affecting fetal hemodynamics and inducing fetal cardiac remodeling, such as maternal diabetes mellitus (DM) and placental pathologies with ensuing fetal growth restriction (FGR). STE is already used in adults and pediatrics, but is still under evaluation in fetal medicine. The aim of this pilot study is to substantiate the feasibility of FetalHQ, a newly developed speckle tracking software, and to determine normal values of fetal strain throughout pregnancy. Also, potential effects of maternal DM and FGR on fetal strain will be studied. 
Methods: Fetal STE was performed in uncomplicated pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by maternal DM or FGR. Dynamic cine loop clips of the fetal heart were collected during regular planned ultrasound examinations between 18-40 weeks of gestation. Global longitudinal strain values of the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) were measured at each examination using offline software FetalHQ. Intra- and interobserver variability were estimated using intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. Linear mixed effect models were used to determine the development of fetal strain throughout gestation and potential effects of maternal DM and FGR on fetal strain. Mean strain values within 18-24 weeks, 25-31 weeks and 32-40 weeks of gestation were compared between study groups using independent-samples T-test and Mann-Whitney U test.
Results: A total of 69 participants (101 clips) with uncomplicated pregnancies, 20 participants (46 clips) with pregnancies complicated by maternal DM and 18 participants (52 clips) with pregnancies complicated by FGR were included. Comparing examinations between observers showed moderate agreement for the LV and poor agreement for the RV, with significant differences in measurements between observers for both ventricles. Comparing repeated measurements of one observer showed good agreement for the LV and moderate agreement for the RV, with significant differences between repeated measurements of the RV only. Analysis of good quality clips only improved agreement between and within observers. Fetal strain in uncomplicated pregnancies showed a significant decrease with advancing pregnancy in both ventricles. No significant differences were observed between fetal strain in uncomplicated pregnancies and fetal strain in pregnancies complicated by maternal DM or FGR.
Conclusion: This pilot study showed that the feasibility of speckle tracking analysis using FetalHQ is currently limited. Reliability and reproducibility of strain analysis should be improved by gaining experience with the analysis and standardizing the operative protocol, such as image acquisitions and angle of insonation, before implementation as a tool to evaluate fetal cardiac function."

Er is gekozen om de communicatie-uitingen te analyseren in de periode januari 2017 tot en met 2022 voor FvD, en januari 2018 tot en met 2022 voor VOX. Om dit te onderzoeken is gekeken naar de partijen in het algemeen en naar hun overeenkomsten, waarna ze middels een literatuurreview zijn gecategoriseerd als radicaal-rechts populistische partijen. Daarnaast worden in de literatuurreview de concepten ‘framing’ en ‘social media’ besproken, om een beeld te schetsen van het analyseren van framing op het social media platform Twitter en daarnaast in verkiezingsprogramma’s. 
Met dit onderzoek is de volgende onderzoeksvraag beantwoord: op welke manier gebruiken de Nederlandse politieke partij FvD en de Spaanse politieke partij VOX framing wanneer zij communiceren over een actueel onderwerp als het klimaatbeleid in hun Twitter-boodschappen en verkiezingsprogramma’s en hoe kijken politieke communicatie experts hiernaar?

Voor dit onderzoek is gebruik gemaakt van een kwalitatieve analyse van de twitterpagina’s van FvD en VOX en van hoofdstukken uit de recentste verkiezingsprogramma’s van deze partijen. Om de frames te analyseren, is gebruik gemaakt van de inzichten van Van Gorp (2006). Zijn inductieve manier van framing-analyse is in dit onderzoek toegepast, zodat er met een ‘open blik’ naar communicatie-uitingen van de partijen gekeken is. Op deze manier konden de frames beschreven worden zonder dat hier vooraf een manier van interpretatie voor was opgesteld. Verder zijn van de te analyseren tweets en programma’s per partij twee tweets en één citaat uit het verkiezingsprogramma voorgelegd aan drie politieke communicatie experts: hoogleraren Baldwin van Gorp, Hans de Bruijn en Stefaan Walgrave. Door middel van interviews is aan hen gevraagd om hun expertise van framing en populisme te gebruiken om de communicatie-uitingen van FvD en VOX te analyseren.

Uit zowel de analyse als uit de expertise van de hoogleraren is gebleken dat FvD en VOX vergelijkbare manieren van framing hanteren op Twitter en in hun verkiezingsprogramma’s. De boodschappen van beide partijen sluiten veelal aan bij de kernwaarden van hun beoogde doelgroep, zoals de nationalistische waarden van respectievelijk Nederlanders en Spanjaarden. Tegelijkertijd worden de kernwaarden van hun tegenstanders aangevallen, door te beargumenteren dat het beleid van gevestigde partijen niet deugt. Bovendien is de onderliggende boodschap bij zowel de Nederlandse als de Spaanse politieke partij meerdere malen dat het beleid van de gevestigde partijen niet voldoet aan wat de burger nodig heeft, en stellen FvD en VOX dat zij de burger wel het beleid kunnen bieden dat zij nodig hebben. Beide partijen refereren daarbij vaak aan de nationale identiteit en de Nederlandse of Spaanse waarden om deze boodschap kracht bij te zetten. Zo stelt FvD dat zij, in tegenstelling tot andere partijen, het belang van de Nederlandse boeren erkennen en benoemen zij veelal ‘de trots op de Nederlandse landbouw’, en wordt het woord ‘klimaat’ vaak in verband gebracht met ‘bizar’ en ‘waanzin’. VOX benoemt ook vaak sectoren als landbouw, visserij en stierenvechten als ‘belangrijk voor de Spaanse identiteit’, en stelt ook meerdere keren dat de ‘klimaatreligie’ bedacht is om Spanjaarden dwars te zitten.

History and belief coalitions in conservation conflict. A case study of conservation and management of wolves and wild boar in the Western Carpathians.,"['Reilly, Brian']","['Runhaar, Hens']",2022-09-09T03:02:13Z,EN,['conservation conflict; historical context; beliefs; coalitions; cooperation network'],Sustainable Development,"Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) is a key issue facing wildlife conservation. The Western Carpathians are the site of increasing human-wildlife conflicts as the human population grows, more land is developed, and wolves make a comeback in Europe. The negative interactions of HWC result in costs for humans, their resources, wildlife, and habitats. Research indicates HWC is often driven by underlying human-human conflicts, known as conservation conflicts. In the Western Carpathians, groups of stakeholders clash over the level of protection of the wolf, and the appropriate management of the wild boar population. Conservation research however pays little attention to social factors driving conservation conflict, or factors that promote cooperation in conservation. This research begins to fill this gap by exploring how local historical developments in the Western Carpathians influence stakeholder cooperation in the conservation and management of wolves and wild boar. The research tests the hypothesis that historical developments inform the development of individual’s beliefs which in turn form the glue that binds together coalitions of cooperating stakeholders in wildlife conservation and management. To test this, data on stakeholder cooperation, beliefs, and narratives regarding historical developments were collected through in-person interviews with 21 conservation and management stakeholders. Network analysis was applied to the cooperation data, and qualitative content analysis was applied to beliefs and narratives. As predicted by the advocacy coalition framework (ACF), policy core beliefs regarding problem framings and preferred solutions to HWC were the glue that held coalitions together. Stakeholders’ historical narratives were more frequently shared between coalitions than within them, that is, they bridged separate coalitions. No evidence of a causative relationship between narratives and beliefs was found. The research demonstrates the relevance of investigating the social factors underlying conservation conflicts and HWC. The advocacy coalition framework is particularly applicable to the context of conservation conflicts by highlighting commonalities in coalitions’ understandings of problems and solutions. With the addition of network analysis, this multi- disciplinary approach was particularly suitable for 1) relating individual level perspectives to group-level dynamics; and 2) identifying bridging stakeholders, beliefs, and narratives, which can be utilised by stakeholders or future research to initiate discussion, trust, and new cooperation and promote coexistence with wolves and boar."
“Ik neem mezelf mee naar het werk”,"['Meer, Lise van der']","['Waardenburg, Maikel']",2022-09-09T03:02:05Z,NL,['Emotionele arbeid; Emoties; Provincie; Deep acting; Surface acting; Betekenisgeving; Intersectionaliteit; Affect Culture; Affect climate; Zelfdeterminatietheorie'],"Organisaties, verandering en management","Emotionele arbeid is schadelijk voor organisaties en hun medewerkers. Toch komt het voor in 
verschillende sectoren. Dit onderzoek geeft inzicht in de totstandkoming van emotionele arbeid door 
de onderliggende betekenisgeving in kaart te brengen. Het is een kwalitatieve case study naar de 
provincie Gelderland met een kritisch-interpretatieve benadering. Aan de hand van interviews, 
observaties en documentanalyse wordt onderzocht hoe medewerkers van de organisatie betekenis 
geven aan het uiten van emoties op het werk.

Uit de resultaten blijkt dat de waarde om goed voor anderen te zorgen een centrale rol speelt in het 
denken over emotionele uitingen. Er bestaan binnen de organisatie drie verschillende overtuigingen 
over hoe het uiten van emoties zich verhoudt tot deze waarde: de signaalfunctie van emoties uiten, 
het effect op de omgeving en de verbindende en verlichtende werking van het delen van emoties. 
Hoewel deze waarde en overtuigingen breed gedeeld worden binnen de organisatie, zijn er 
belangrijke verschillen tussen de individuele betekenisgevingsprocessen. In situaties waarin de 
verschillende overtuigingen met elkaar botsen ontstaat ambiguïteit. Welke overtuiging dan de 
boventoon voert hangt af van de interpretaties van de medewerker. Voor medewerkers met een 
kwetsbare positie binnen de organisatie en medewerkers die in niet-dominante sociale categorieën 
vallen spelen daarnaast overwegingen over veiligheid en professionaliteit een rol in de 
betekenisgeving.

De verschillen in betekenisgevingsprocessen leiden tot een variëteit aan manieren om met emoties 
om te gaan. Er is daarbij een verschil tussen ‘positieve’ emoties, die vaak geuit worden, en 
‘negatieve’ emoties, die vaker worden bijgestuurd of binnengehouden. Dit zijn vormen van deep 
acting en surface acting. Ook reacties op uitingen van anderen zijn relevant voor de betekenisgeving 
omdat ze een rol spelen in de veiligheid die anderen ervaren om hun emoties te uiten. De reacties op 
‘negatieve’ emoties die voorkomen bij de provincie Gelderland variëren van pogingen om de oorzaak 
op te lossen tot het bespreken van een uiting met derden en van het proberen om een emotie om te 
buigen tot luisteren en doorvragen. 

Machtsongelijkheid leidt tot verschillen in betekenisgeving tussen medewerkers. Deze verschillen 
houden vervolgens de machtsongelijkheid in stand. Medewerkers die door hun kwetsbare positie 
onvoldoende veiligheid ervaren om emoties te uiten zullen ze vaker binnenhouden of bijsturen, wat 
gepaard gaat met emotionele arbeid. Omdat problemen vaan gepaard gaan met ‘negatieve’ emoties 
kunnen kwetsbare medewerkers moeilijker opkomen voor hun belangen. Bovendien zijn er 
aanwijzingen dat het verrichten van emotionele arbeid belastender voor hen is omdat ze dit doen 
vanuit minder autonome vormen van motivatie. Daarom helpt inzicht in onderliggende 
machtsstructuren om individuele betekenisgevingsprocessen te doorgronden en in context te 
plaatsen."

Lacking adaptive skills can negatively impact the general wellbeing of these children compared to typically developing peers. A newly researched intervention called STAP (the Dutch version of STEP-ASD) aims to help children with ASD or AS traits in their school transition by supporting their school and teachers in adapting to the needs of the child. The current study used a longitudinal, experimental design with matched groups to examine how the wellbeing of children with ASD or AS traits (N = 24) develops during school transition in regular education and whether the STAP intervention significantly improves self-reports of wellbeing compared to no intervention. Wellbeing was pre-measured at the end of primary school with the SchoolVragenLijst (SVL) and was tested again twice in the first year of secondary school. Contrary to expectations, a one-way repeated measures ANOVA analysis did not confirm the hypothesis that wellbeing changes during the school transition. Additionally, a mixed ANOVA analysis showed that the STAP intervention did not significantly improve wellbeing during the transition. Due to limitations, results cannot provide definitive conclusions. However, the current study highlights the need for extensive research to determine the development of wellbeing at school of children with AS traits or ASD in regular education. In addition, interventions like STAP should be investigated to define practical implications for teachers and parents to support these children."
Gemeentelijk groenbeleid en het (subjectieve) mentale welzijnsniveau van jongeren,"['Schoorl, Dwight van']","['Vollaard, Hans']",2022-09-09T03:02:19Z,NL,"['mentaal welzijn, groen, jongeren, gezondheidsbaten, levenstevredenheid, fysieke gezondheid']",Bestuur en beleid,"Samenvatting

Achtergrond: Het aantal jongeren dat in Nederland te maken krijgt met mentale welzijnsproblematiek neemt de afgelopen jaren toe en de verwachting is dat dit nog verder toe zal nemen. Gemeenten zijn verantwoordelijk voor allerlei beleid dat van invloed is op het mentaal welzijn. Dat betreft allereerst Jeugdzorg. Gemeenten doen echter veel meer dat van invloed is op het mentale welzijn van jongeren. Denk daarbij aan beleid over onderwijs, werkgelegenheid, uitgaansleven en sport. Uit studies blijkt dat aanwezigheid van groen een factor van invloed kan zijn op het (subjectieve) mentale welzijn, maar over hoe dit precies met elkaar samenhangt is nog weinig bekend. Dit onderzoek met toetsend karakter richt zich daarom enerzijds op de rol van de gemeente in groenbeleid en anderzijds of dit groenbeleid samenhang kan vertonen met het (subjectieve) mentale welzijn van jongeren.3

Methode: In dit onderzoek is gebruik gemaakt van een zelf samengestelde dataset met gegevens over groen en groenbeleid van 389 Nederlandse gemeenten en een dataset met gegevens over (mentaal) welzijn van jongeren afkomstig uit het in 2017 uitgevoerde HBSC onderzoek (Health Behaviour in School-aged children). Deze dataset bestaat uit 8890 respondenten in de leeftijd van 11 tot en met 16 jaar. Aan de hand van drie hypothesen zijn correlatieanalyses uitgevoerd om inzicht te verkrijgen in de samenhang tussen gemeentelijk groenbeleid en mentaal welzijn van jongeren. 

Resultaten: Naar aanleiding van dit onderzoek is vastgesteld dat de ambitie van gemeenten op groenbeleid geen samenhang vertoont met levenstevredenheid van jongeren. Deze samenhang met levenstevredenheid van jongeren is eveneens niet vastgesteld door te kijken naar de hoeveelheid van groen en afstand tot groen in een gemeente. 

Conclusie: Op de hoofdvraag van dit onderzoek: Welke samenhang bestaat er tussen gemeentelijk groenbeleid en het mentaal welzijn van jongeren moet worden geantwoord dat er in dit onderzoek géén samenhang is vastgesteld. 

Aanbevelingen: Afgaande op de resultaten in dit onderzoek kunnen gemeenten beter investeren in beleid waarvan de positieve uitwerking op het mentale welzijn van jongeren reeds voldoende is bewezen. Met betrekking tot de gezondheidsbaten die eventueel voortkomen uit de aanwezigheid van groen moet nog veel vervolgonderzoek worden gedaan. Een mogelijke invalshoek is vergelijkende studie tussen Nederlandse gemeenten met een afstand tot park en plantsoen tot 500 meter, en gemeenten met een afstand tot park en plantsoen van meer dan 500 meter, afgezet tegen de levensverwachting van jongeren. Anders dan in dit onderzoek moet dan wel beter rekening gehouden worden met de verschillen tussen stad en platteland."

PSE is linked to many positive child-parent outcomes and since it is malleable, it can be strengthened through interventions. While PSE is generally lower in refugee parents and parents of adolescents, research about parenting interventions for refugee parents of adolescents is scarce. The sample consisted of three refugee mothers who fled war in Syria. Using an experience sampling method, they reported on their PSE up to 10 times a day over a course of 15 days. The participants had individual baseline periods, after which the intervention took place. Data was analyzed using interrupted time series analysis. Results show that the participants reported a significant increase in PSE from the baseline to intervention period. These findings suggest that a tailored parenting intervention is able to strengthen PSE in refugee parents of adolescents. Future studies should analyze whether this strengthened PSE translates into actual parenting behavior."

Taking a closer listen at Regina José Galindo’s sound performance ‘Las Escucharon Gritar y No Abrieron la Puerta’ (2017), this thesis explores how the performance of negative affect can counter cultural silences surrounding femicide in the context of Guatemala and, in doing so, challenge its dominant cultural memory. Departing from the problematic position of memory in post-war Guatemala and the inadequacies of the traditional testimonial form demonstrated in the stark contrast between the civil war’s ongoing legacy of gender-based violence and the strategic amnesia enabled by the nationally-endorsed discourse on progress, this thesis addresses the need for alternative forms of memory-making in attending to traumatic hi/stories. Observing how the embodied reality of traumatic memory often resists narration, this thesis explores the potential of artistic practices in attending to the affective registers of (traumatic) memory. Through a semiotic reading of the scream as an auditory signifier of grief, this thesis demonstrates the disruptive potential of the bodily performance of negative affect, describing how the scream, in making audible the negative affect of grief, opens up a space for the ongoing negotiation over the meaning of loss and, in doing so, counters the silence surrounding femicide in Guatemala. Additionally, this thesis finds that, in its affective re-call of the past, the scream reevaluates hi/stories of gender-based violence as ‘unfinished’, disrupting the teleology of the nationally-endorsed narrative and, subsequently, produces a countermemory that fractures the carefully constructed cultural memory of Guatemala, sculpted in favour of a unidirectional move toward a ‘promising’ future."
Assessing sea lice management strategies for the Norwegian salmon industry,"['Friederich, Casper']","['Frenken, Koen']",2022-09-09T04:03:09Z,EN,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Norwegian salmon farming has experienced rapid growth in the last few decades, and has turned into a billion-dollar industry. The Norwegian government aims to support further growth with the goal to quintuple value creation from aquaculture by 2050. Before this goal can be achieved, however, several challenges that hamper growth need to be overcome. The growing sea lice pressure is commonly perceived as the single most important challenge. Sea lice are parasites affecting salmon by feeding on its skin and blood and the economic impact they have on the industry is massive. The impact of lice is predominantly a consequence of the high density of salmon kept on farms, which allows the lice to accumulate and multiply more easily. 
The Norwegian government has been regulating the growth of the salmon industry by utilizing a Maximum Allowable Biomass system and a Traffic Light System, which is specifically designed to reduce sea lice levels. The functioning of these systems is heavily debated. The industry itself also responded to the sea lice challenge by implementing different strategies to control sea lice levels but so far these have not yet proved to provide  long-term solutions. Furthermore, methods that are currently used, come with numerous concerns related to fish welfare and environmental sustainability. 
This study aims to assess the sea lice management strategies and associated delousing methods and cage technologies that are currently used and explored to reduce the sea lice pressure while taking into account multiple indicators. Multi-Criteria-Mapping was used to let stakeholders appraise the most common delousing methods. This is a mixed-method, software-assisted tool that allows participants to assign scores to several options, delousing methods in this case, for a number of self-defined criteria. 
A total of seven participants scored the initial list of eight options and three of them proposed an additional option. It became clear that every method has its flaws and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It is location-dependent whether a certain method or cage technology works best, for which criteria need to be developed. The sea lice problem calls for a novel approach, in which prevention is chosen over cure. Innovative technologies like depth-based interventions, land-based farming and genetic editing might provide better long-term preventative solutions. Next to that, big data is believed to have enormous potential for managing farms in general. To support these solutions, proper coordination by the Norwegian government is pivotal."
Exploring the dark side of job crafting,"['Schouten, Bjorn']","['Taris, Toon']",2022-09-09T04:03:03Z,EN,['Job crafting; dark triad personality; work engagement; job satisfaction; counterproductive work behaviour'],"Social, Health and Organisational Psychology","In the current literature job crafting has been found to have many beneficial effects on work outcomes. However, job crafting seems to be mostly used in its broadest sense and little attention is paid to its underlying intentionality/motivation. Since in previous research the beneficial effects of proactive personality on outcomes seemed to be fully mediated by job crafting, the question arises if the same is true for dark triad personality characteristics and undesirable work outcomes. Therefore, the dark side of job crafting will be explored by studying the relation between dark triad personality and work outcomes as mediated through job crafting. Further, an extra motivational dimension has been added to existing job crafting scales to create a bright (organization-centered) and dark (self-centered) version. Results showed that job crafting does fully mediate the effects of dark triad personality traits for positive work outcomes when it is organization-centered, and for some negative work outcomes when it is self-centered. This shows that there is merit to adding dimensions such as intentionality/motivation to job crafting and further research could expand further on this theme."

This makes migrants to keep traveling around to seek for better opportunities. However, what aspirations are behind a discission to move or to stay, and how these mobility trajectories look like is still unknown. This study is focusing on Sub-Saharan African migrants working in the Italian agricultural industry. A case study was done in the Southern Italian province of Foggia and a qualitative research design was used. Investigation took place in a period of three months whereby participant observations, 15 participant interviews and 7 expert interviews helped to answered the research question “How do Sub-Saharan African migrants working in the Italian agricultural sector organize their livelihoods and how does this influence their (im)mobility trajectories?”. Outcomes reveal that migrants in Italy are stuck in a vicious circle. The most important aspects in ones livelihood are having a residence permit and a stable job, followed by adequate housing. However, for one of these, the other is needed. Circumstances of exploitation have decreased over time, but migrants still seek better life elsewhere. Migrants travel through Italy or Europe in search for a better opportunities. Thus, the conclusion can be drawn that migrants mobility trajectories are considered as a continues journey rather than a fixed one. Knowing migrants trajectories and their aspirations behind them can contribute in better migration policies for the whole of Europe."
Generic Incremental Computation for Regular Datatypes in Haskell,"['Gorkum, Jort van']","['Swierstra, W.S.']",2022-09-09T04:03:02Z,EN,"['incremental algorithm, datatype-generic programming, zipper, merkle tree, generic, regular datatypes, cache policies, pattern synonyms']",Computing Science,"Incremental computation is a method which tries to save time by only recomputing the output of changed input. A technique of incremental computation is memoization. Memoization stores the result of a computation and returns the cached result when the same input occurs again. As a result, a large part of memoization becomes dependent on determining if the input is equal to an already cached input. This can become problematic when a computation is given a large recursive data structure. To improve the performance of memoization this paper introduces an incremental algorithm which determines the equality in constant time. This is accomplished by storing hash values/digests, which describe the internal structure, inside the data structure. Furthermore, the incremental algorithm describes how to efficiently update the digests, using a Zipper, when the data structure changes. The incremental algorithm is then implemented using Datatype-generic programming, to support the class of regular datatypes. Meanwhile, the usage of the generic implementation stays the same for the developers as writing the non-incremental algorithm in Haskell. Finally, we show that the performance is better than the non-incremental version with minimal extra memory usage, when correctly tuned with cache policies."
Enhancing lesion segmentation on contrast MR images in Multiple Sclerosis using deep learning,"['Bos, Lonneke']","['Kuijf, Hugo']",2022-09-09T04:03:12Z,EN,[],Medical Imaging,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized by lesions in the brain. Lesions are inflammations in the brain and are visible in Magnetic Resonance images as void shaped hyperintensities after administration of a Gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA’s). Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been used among other researchers, in MS lesion segmentations; however, the existing methods have limitations making them difficult to be applicable to different MR scanners. Likewise, the goal of this research is to segment lesions on MR images using deep learning. Deep learning is an artificial intelligence method where data processing is are used to extract features from data. Features of lesions are for example their shape, intensity, and location in the brain. The deep learning method used in this research is called a V-net, which is a 3D structure that is suitable for volumetric image segmentations. A deep learning model is first trained with a dataset, here it learns all the features needed for lesion segmentation. Subsequently, the trained model is tested with a similar dataset to test how well it performs. To acquire the dataset two annotators manually segmented lesions in MR data and fed it to the model. The goal of the deep learning model is to predict an accurate lesion segmentation. Analysis of the segmentation quality before and after discussion between the two annotators concluded that this increased the quality of the delineation and therefore the model performance. A model can be trained with different number of epochs, this is defined as the number of times that the algorithm will work through the dataset. The model is analyzed with 50 epochs (shallow training) and 150 epochs (extensive training). The accuracy of the lesion segmentation is increased when the model is shallow trained, compared to extensive training. The quality of the model when used on a completely new, unseen dataset was tested and it showed that the model is not good enough to predict lesions when data with other MR protocols are used. Additionally, based on the findings of this work, there are preliminary findings that using different MR scanners can influence the model performance. The method can be improved by using a larger dataset. Summarizing, this deep learning model stands a proof of concept for lesion segmentation using limited data."

Het onderzoek naar luisterbegrip(vraagsoorten) en kinderen met een TOS is echter schaars. Het eerste doel van dit onderzoek was om de invloed van de vraagsoort bij luisterbegripstaken bij kinderen met en zonder een TOS te achterhalen. De drie vraagsoorten variëren van letterlijke vragen tot complexe vragen waarbij het vormen van een situatiemodel vereist is. Het tweede doel was om te achterhalen of receptieve woordenschat, verbaal werkgeheugen en vertelvaardigheid voorspellers zijn van de uitkomst van verschillende luisterbegripsvraagsoorten.

Novel accelerometer-based markers for physical activity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on an open-source summary metric,"['Niederbacher, Lisi']","['Eijkemans, René']",2022-09-14T00:02:25Z,EN,[],Applied Data Science,"Accelerometer-based physical activity monitoring has previously been shown to be an objective 
method for quantifying disease progression in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Currently, accelerometer-based endpoints are based on Activity Counts (AC), a metric provided by accelerometer manufacturers to summarize raw accelerometer data into epochs. However, Activity Counts 
are proprietary and not calculated the same across manufacturers, making results more difficult to reproduce, less comparable, and potentially slowing down ALS research. 
As a result, this thesis project investigates whether markers based on the open-source summary 
metric Activity Index (AI) can be used to quantify disease progression and thus serve as an alternative 
to AC-based markers.
 This research made use of an existing data set from a previously conducted longitudinal cohort 
study. In the study, 42 ALS patients wore the ActiGraph during waking hours for seven days every 2-3 
months. In addition, they provided additional information about their daily functioning as measured by 
the ALS functional rating score (ALSFRS-R). The raw accelerometer data was pre-processed, and 61 
modified AI metrics for ten different epoch lengths were calculated. These metrics were used in the 
calculation of three marker types. In total, 183 different markers were defined, each of which aimed to 
reflect the physical activity of a patient. Finally, the associations of these markers with clinical markers 
of disease severity, the longitudinal rates of decline, and the associations of AI-based markers with AC-based markers were investigated.
All markers were moderate to strongly associated with the ALSFRS-R total score (0.73, 95% 
CI 0.56 – 0.88, p<0.001), and their correlations increased with increasing epoch length. Most markers 
showed less between-patient variability over time than the ALSFRS-R total score (coefficient of variation 0.80 – 1.18 vs. 1.06, respectively). In comparison to some AC-based markers, AI-based markers 
had slightly lower correlations and a higher between-patient variability over time. AI-based markers 
were strongly correlated with the AC-based markers.
In conclusion, this thesis project demonstrated that activity markers based on AI metrics can be 
used to quantify disease progression in patients with ALS and have the potential to be an alternative to

In the mainstream Dutch narrative, oil and gas are often portrayed as heroic entities that have contributed significantly to the country's wealth and history. However, communities living near extraction sites have direct contact with the company and can offer a counter-narrative which differs from that which is put forward by oil companies. In this thesis, I will focus on two small rural towns in the northern Netherlands that nurture two opposing narratives with respect to fossil fuel extraction. In both locations, extraction has affected the lifestyle of local communities, albeit in two different ways. My analysis took place in Schoonebeek and Appingedam; in the former locality people generally hold a positive view toward extractions, while in the latter many people protest to stop gas extractions. In order to understand these differences, the subjective experience of extractions and the social strategies implemented by NAM [Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij] must be analyzed. Using a multi-site approach, I will reflect on the different social strategies put in place by the company and analyze how these are intertwined with people's perceptions of extractions. Considering the direct experiences of the communities surrounding these extraction sites, this thesis aims to analyze the effects of these extractions, which are often not considered in official accounts."
Navigating power dynamics: An anthropological perspective on employees working with Female Genital Cutting in the Netherlands,"['Veldhuizen, Emese']","['Bondt, Danse de']",2022-09-14T00:02:26Z,EN,"['Female Genital Cutting, power dynamics, universalism, cultural relativism, \nknowledge']",Cultural Anthropology: Sustainable Citizenship,"Worldwide 300 million girls and women experience the effects of Female Genital Cutting (FGC), and more than four million girls are at risk of being circumcised every year (Amref Flying Doctors n.d). The practice of FGC varies in different countries, regions, communities, cultures, religions, as well as in the reason why FGC is practiced. Because of all these varieties in forms of FGC, Walley (1997, 429) argues that lumping different types of FGC into one phrase is inaccurate. Different meanings of FGC exposes the entanglement in different notions of cultures, human rights, the existing discourse of the idea what is right or wrong, forms of opposition, and the different power relations. Employees working on FGC related programs, and the organizations they work for, hold on to the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO), which is mainly based on health concerns and ending FGC. While employees work towards ending FGC, they also find it important to be culturally sensitive, and understand FGC from within the particular cultural context. The purpose of this thesis is to examine how employees working on FGC related projects, are constantly navigating power dynamics. These power dynamics refer to tensions in relation to FGC, that have to do with traditions, customs, knowledge, behavior, norms and values. These tensions make that employees struggle in living up to their organizations norms and values, make that employees subconsciously participate in a world in which stigmatization continues, and that these power dynamics affect employees' own agency. Therefore, this thesis shows that employees are constantly navigating power dynamics while working on FGC related programs through various forms of tension."

These practices can formulate new understandings of ‘sustainability’ that reconfigure the relation between humans and nature, one that is not rooted upon domination and exploitation of our planet.T
his dimension of world-making is a deviation from the formations made conventional within the processes of Western modernity, which are rooted in rationality of thought and built upon centuries of imperialism, colonization, and the diffusion of uncontested values that place technology, productivity, and science above all.

widespread implementation due to a lack of scientific evidence and thorough understanding of its
inner workings. Studies on gamification have most often reported an overall increases in motiva-

of the user group. The game-element that is most often linked to negative effects such as loss of
performance is the leaderboard. To advance the discipline, we have set our focus on providing a
deeper understanding of what aspects cause, influence and effect the gamification element leader-

a reflection on their experience. The second part of the study consisted of two qualitative 1-hour
focus group sessions (N=8), in which a more thorough understanding of the experience and the
results was discussed. Seven factors that influence the leaderboard effect were identified, as well
as five requirements when implementing the leaderboard in educational context. Our study shows
an increase in motivation for some people, while simultaneously creating a less enjoyable learn-
ing environment for others. This research presents an overview of what causes this motivation or

Agitprop Theater and Kurt Weill’s Collaborations of 1927–1928,"['Borshansky, Ethan']","['Andries, Annelies']",2022-09-30T00:00:38Z,EN,[],Musicology,"Agitprop theater (a portmanteau deriving from agitatsiya and propaganda) was a form of politically charged troupe performance that came to the fore in the early years of the Soviet Union. As the ten-year anniversary of the Russian Revolution in 1927 brought a renewed push for Soviet celebration and propaganda, agitprop theater emerged as an international phenomenon with particularly strong traction in the Weimar Republic. The robust and increasingly radical music and theater culture of late 1920s Weimar allowed for rapid assimilation of agitprop theater into both vernacular and professional music and theater realms. Yet despite its significant presence in Weimar, agitprop has yet to be accounted for by musicologists in relation to Kurt Weill’s concurrent radical developments of 1927–1928. How significant was cultural and ideological cross-fertilization between the growth of agitprop in Weimar and the radical developments of Kurt Weill’s collaborations of 1927–1928? I approach this question less with a biographical focus and more with the aim of a better understanding of Weill’s milieu and its capacity for assimilating elements of agitprop theater. I take two case studies for which Weill wrote music, Mahagonny Songspiel (1927), produced with Bertolt Brecht and set designer Caspar Neher, and Leo Lania’s play Konjunktur (1928) produced with Erwin Piscator. I rely on discourse analysis involving several articles by Weill and his contemporary theater critics and communist journals to portray an interconnected culture turning towards embodiment of strong anti-bourgeois and anti-capitalist ethics. I then interpret these two productions using a staging analysis based on photographs and descriptions to draw out more concrete parallels to agitprop. Finally, I conduct a musical analysis of Weill’s contributions to these works to identify the ways his music reinforced agitprop aesthetics. I argue that Weill’s collaborative projects of 1927–1928 reflect agitprop theater in ideological, dramaturgical, and musical terms and that this indicates a highly networked and distributed culture of music theater in step with Soviet solidarity. I also suggest that this link merits additional consideration to Weimar cultural historiography, particularly with the hindsight of current new media scholarship on propaganda and social networks."
Transmission models of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in Dutch broiler production chain,"['Furusawa, Minori']","['Fischer, Egil']",2022-09-30T00:00:44Z,EN,['Broiler production chain; ESBL; model'],One Health,"Introduction: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli in animals, especially in chickens, are considered a risk to human health, because this type of bacteria can be a continuous threat of the emergence of new bacteria that are resistant to antimicrobials. Antimicrobials are a kind of medicine that is widely used to treat human diseases such as penicillins, which are used to treat throat infections, meningitis, and syphilis. Disease caused by resistant bacteria cannot be cured with antimicrobials. Although the proportion of chickens with ESBL-producing E. coli drastically declined over the years in Dutch farms, chicken meat was still the most contaminated meat product among others. In addition, the bacteria can be found in all stages of the chicken production chain. The chain consists of mainly three different farm types: parent stock farms where chickens produce eggs, hatcheries where eggs are incubated, and broiler farms where chickens are fattened up for meat. Therefore, further control of ESBL-producing E. coli in the chicken production chain is important to reduce public health risks.
Objective: The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of intervention scenarios to control the transmission of ESBL-producing E. coli in the chicken production chain and to estimate the risk to public health.
Methods: In this study, we developed two different types of transmission models to describe the observed transmission dynamics within a chicken farm: one based on the immune development of chickens and one based on the infection characteristics of the bacteria. Both included the environmental contamination effect between production rounds and within flocks. The parameter values, which determine the spread of bacteria, were estimated by using the Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method. This method is a way to find the most appropriate parameter value by comparing the observed data with the simulated data. Then, we applied the models to the three stages in the chicken production chain and further added the effect of mixing eggs and chicks from different farms. The size of a flock and the number of farms were adjusted to the Dutch situation. Several intervention scenarios, including bird vaccination and farm disinfection, were applied to the models. Finally, using the simulated data, risk to human health was estimated.
Results: Two models were developed based on two different assumptions, which were development of immunity of the chickens and difference between the infection characteristics of the bacteria. Both models were able to capture the observed transmission dynamics. The proportion of infected chickens on the day of slaughter was 10.59% and 13.56%, respectively. The proportion of the Dutch population becoming infected by consuming chicken meat was estimated at 0.14% and 0.18%, respectively. If the bacteria in the farm environment were eliminated by cleaning and disinfection, the infected proportion of chickens would be reduced to 0.61% and 0.52%, respectively, and that of humans to 0.01%.
Conclusions: Both models were able to describe the observed transmission dynamics within and between the production stages equally well and estimate the outcome of the interventions quantitatively. Both indicated that improving farm management to eliminate the bacteria from the farm environment was the most effective intervention. According to our models, chicken meat was not a major source for transmitting the bacteria to humans."
Social Justice for Sex Workers: The Effects of Neoliberalism's Punitive Turn on Sex Work Policy in Spain,"['Thibeault, Maéva']","['Midden, Eva']",2022-09-30T23:00:31Z,EN,['sex work; neoliberalism; feminism'],GEMMA: Master degree in Women's and Gender studies,"There is no specific law regulating sex work in Spain, nor is the selling and buying of sexual services between consenting adults criminalized under the Criminal Code. Nevertheless, it could be argued that Spain’s legal framework is akin to the prohibitionist model as it encompasses a series of laws and policies that indirectly criminalize sex workers. Following neoliberalism’s punitive turn, the behaviors that are considered crimes are no longer addressed through penal welfarism and rehabilitation, but through discipline, punishment, and incapacitation. Extending to all spheres of society, the punitive turn had reverberations in feminist movements who in the 1970s and 1980s began to revindicate harsher penal sentences for crimes of gender violence, including sex work and sex trafficking. Using a decolonial and penal abolitionist feminist approach, this thesis seeks to answer the following question: How do neoliberal politics influence sex work policy in Spain and what are the consequences on sex workers? I use critical discourse analysis to examine two legislative documents that control sex work in the public space in Spain: the “Ordinance to Promote and Guarantee Civic Coexistence in the Public Space of Barcelona” and the “Organic Law 4/2015, of 30 March, on Citizen Protection and Security.” I show how, under the pretense of coexistence, civility, and citizen security, these policies exacerbate stigmatization, vulnerability, and physical, mental, social, and economic violence for sex workers. I argue that the penal system is unfit to address the harms related to sex work as it systematically reproduces violence against racialized and marginalized communities. I argue for social, racial, and economic—rather than penal—justice for sex workers. I conclude by reflecting on possible alternatives to criminalization, including New Zealand’s decriminalization model."
"Improving paragraph reading: The effect of beginning-of-line additions in readability, an eye tracking experiment","['Mangas Afonso, Héctor']","['Heeman, Jessica']",2022-10-01T00:00:32Z,EN,"['reading, eye tracking, reading speed, eyelink 1000, readability, diamonds, EyeLink, repeating of words, anadiplosis']",Applied Cognitive Psychology,"From a perceptual point of view, a paragraph is a very complex and tangled unit of information. Paragraphs contain a multitude of shapes that can’t be interpreted all at once. Precise navigation is thus essential. The present research tests three conditions expected to affect navigation within paragraphs, both based on previous literature and editorial design history. In the 15th century, a common practice was to add the first word of the next page at the bottom of the current one (De Hamel, 1992). Contemporary research has shown within a block of text, line differentiation greatly affects its readability, as return sweeps (the eye-movement to transition between lines) can be performed more precisely (Bhatia et al., 2014; Rello et al., 2016). The present study therefore looks at how additional elements at the beginning of each line affect readability. Following intuitive knowledge from the typesetting community, the repeating of words was considered. Two design choices - one embedded and one outside were used. Another line differentiation condition, which involved a graphic addition (diamonds before each line) was also studied. It was expected to observe an improvement in reading performance against a control condition. Results showed considerable reduction in reading time, amount of fixations and leftward saccades for the diamond condition against control. The two text addition conditions, though, performed worse than control. These results show word repetition is not useful, as it seems to add cognitive load. Meanwhile, simple and distinct shapes before lines do help. Conclusions align with previous research, which suggests back sweep performance is linked with parafoveal information (Slattery & Parker, 2016), visual area in which reading acuity is at a lowest (Sandberg et al., 2008)."

Using the digitalised memorial sites Walk the National Covid Memorial Wall and In America: Remember, I deconstruct their spatial qualities to depict how expressing grief, as a subset of identity formation, is inextricably linked to the context of a performance environment. Within trauma studies, a significant body of work exists examining the impact of traumatic representation on an individual. Within theatre studies, however, the research I have found engages largely with notions of liveness and how technology alters such processes of representation. I have thus attempted to assign digitalised memorials – as performances - equally affective agency. Combining a methodology of expanded scenography with a reading of ritual as performance presents a transformation of the memorial sites into dynamic forms of cultural activity, whereby expressions of grief take on relational forms. With supporting notions from commemorative, site-specific and nomadic theatre practices, I present the term ritual mourning as a processual method with which to transform and contextualise identity and grief in communal forms. 
I thus come to propose digitalised memorial sites – as affective, commemorative, and navigational spaces – as sites of ritual mourning in their ability to create transformative spaces which are open to the relational encounter and exchange of bodies, objects, and environments. In employing the lens of theatre studies, I attempt to ground digitalised memorial sites as spaces in which expressions of grief are granted transformative potentials, thus insinuating the possibility of offering a diverse and communal space in which to tackle collective trauma."

In het wetenschappelijke discours is deze kunstvorm echter relatief
onderbelicht. Wel is er sprake van een groeiend corpus aan onderzoeken, met uiteenlopende benaderingen.
Zo zijn videoclips op visueel esthetisch vlak geanalyseerd, onder meer ook de manieren waarop beeld en
geluid met elkaar interacteren. Deze scriptie is een uitbreiding op deze benadering. Auteurs als Mathias Bonde
Korsgaard, Carol Vernallis en Brad Osborn hebben elkaar door de jaren heen aangevuld met diverse
audiovisuele analyses aan de hand waarvan ze alle verschillende beeld/geluid interactiemogelijkheden
proberen te identificeren en samen te vatten. Hoewel veel videoclips rijk zijn aan audiovisuele verbanden,
bestaan er ook clips waar deze slechts beperkt aanwezig zijn, zoals Drive Home van Steven Wilson. De
aandacht voor dit soort videoclips met weinig beeld/geluid interactie is in de literatuur echter beperkt. Om een
begin te maken aan het opvullen van dit gat in het academische discours, gaat deze scriptie in op de rol die dit
soort interactie-arme passages in videoclips vervullen. Concreet staat de vraag centraal hoe het spelen met de
mate van interactie tussen muziek en beeld in muziekvideo’s een wezenlijk onderdeel van de clip vormt om
emoties op te roepen.

De analyse heeft ervoor gezorgd dat het ontbreken van audiovisuele verbindingen in videoclips niet
alleen überhaupt (meer) erkend wordt als onderdeel van de vorm, maar heeft ook aangetoond dat het spelen
met de mate van interactie een device is om gewicht te leggen op belangrijke gebeurtenissen in de clip, de
aandacht van de kijker te sturen en emotie en betekenis op te roepen en te creëren.
Verder heeft de analyse aangetoond dat een grote verscheidenheid aan concepten die door auteurs
als Vernallis en Korsgaard reeds geïntroduceerd zijn, ook goede handvatten biedt voor de analyse van een
minder-conventionele videoclip als Drive Home. Ook is echter gebleken dat een clip als deze niet zomaar in
dezelfde hokjes te passen is als die de genoemde auteurs hebben voorgesteld. Literatuur en inzichten uit
andere genres, zoals fictiefilm, experimentele film en visual music, hebben een belangrijke bijdrage geleverd
om de video beter te kunnen definiëren. Hieruit blijkt ook nogmaals hoe interdisciplinair muziekvideo’s
kunnen zijn.
De belangrijkste conclusie is echter dat veel van de bevindingen die in deze scriptie gedaan zijn,
gebaseerd zijn op het gedetailleerd analyseren van niet alleen beeld, maar ook de muziek. Door de muziek te
doorgronden op gebied van harmonie, melodie, arrangement, dynamiek, maar ook effecten als flanger,
stereobreedte enzovoorts, kunnen muziekvideo’s genuanceerder geanalyseerd worden en wordt op een

The result of the referendum shocked the international community, left uncertainty surrounding the future of European integration and has since resulted in the emergence of a great deal of literature committed to analysing the outcome of the referendum. Historically, EU referendums and their results have been a way of examining citizen voting behaviour in which political scientists analyse the result of the referendum in order to determine if public opinion on the current government or the EU had an effect on voting thus placing emphasis and attention on the referendum outcome itself. However, in recent years attention has shifted towards the campaign that precedes the referendum to understand voting behaviour by analysing the output and strategies of the respective campaigns and how they frame the narrative of the referendum topic in order to convince the voter to vote a certain way. Thus, this research explores the campaign output and strategy of the Leave Side and their use of postcolonial misconceptions and imperial nostalgia in order to make specific emotional appeals to their voters.
In this context, it asks the following research question: To what extent was the use of postcolonial misconceptions, imperial nostalgia and appeals to emotions present in the campaign strategy and tactics of the Leave side during the United Kingdom European Union membership Referendum (20th February 2016- 30th June 2016)? This research answers the question by making use of several relevant analytical concepts including the ‘’emotional turn’’ in politics, the centrality of euroscepticism and exceptionalism to British politics and postcolonial Britain which together form the analytical framework central to this research. The content analysis is accomplished by making use of and consulting a variety of sources that illustrate a broad picture during the given timeframe of the output of the Leave side including campaign posters, key speeches, statements, newspaper articles and op-eds in order to answer the research questions. While a great deal of academic research exists on the traces of the Empire on the Eurosceptic arguments that underpin discourses opposing EU integration, the emotionality of such a framework remains largely underdeveloped. This thesis aims to challenge this emotional absence by examining the prevalence of imperial nostalgia and postcolonial remains in the campaign material of the Leave Side during the 2016 EU referendum in an effort to appeal to the emotions of the voters and thus contribute to the ‘’emotional turn’’ in international relations"

A picture is worth a thousand words.

Despite the growing attention and mandate for institutional diversity policies, the implications seem more symbolic than effective for those who represent diversity. Many scholars have expressed their criticism, but no practical recommendations are forthcoming. This study aims to narrow the gap between theory and practice by providing constructive implications that contribute to the experience of inclusivity for students in higher education. Considering the constructional function of the concept language (written or spoken language, as well as visual signs and images, gestures, facial expressions, etc.), the focus of this study is on inclusive imagery. Recommendations from current literature on inclusive imagery were collected and have led to the identification of five concepts: the preference for authenticity, the preference for groups over individuals, the active promotion of diversity, the use of counter stereotypes and the avoidance of stereotypes, and the preference for eye contact over no eye contact. Examples illustrating these concepts have been extracted from the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS) image database through a content analysis to serve as input for a survey. The results of the survey, distributed among students from AUAS, have confirmed four of these concepts and yielded a new concept: appropriate context. Despite the limitations of scale, these results suggest that authenticity, actively promoting diversity, displaying groups, representation of an appropriate context and avoidance of stereotypes in images contribute to the feeling of inclusivity for students in higher education."

They provide a new channel for game enthusiasts and potential game enthusiasts to achieve an entertaining gaming experience. The public video-sharing sites where the LP videos are published become platforms for the playful practices that host the LP format. In such a public platform, the public participates in a diverse discourse and discusses social issues. The LP videos posted on the Chinese video site Bilibili have attracted a large audience due to their playfulness and the diverse personalities of the LPers. In addition, LP videos may have a specific potential to contribute to Bilibili as a digital public sphere in China due to the content of the games presented in the LP videos and the comments added by LPers. 

In this thesis, building on the three-dimensional model proposed by Fariclough (1992), I discuss and analyse how LP video in China has contributed to the construction of a public sphere that accommodates gender political issues, starting from the intersection of the fields of gaming and gender politics. In the first chapter, the Chinese Otome games represented by Light and Night will be analysed as texts, and the patriarchal hegemonic frameworks, binary gender divisions and sexist gender norms embedded in the Otome games will be analysed. In the second chapter, several discursive practices in the form of LPs will be used as case studies to analyse how LP videos perform a rebellion against patriarchal hegemony in the society that the game texts fail to achieve. In the third chapter, online groups created by female game enthusiasts and the discussions and activities that take place within them will be analysed as social practices to explore the extent to which the practices that emerge from the intersection of gender politics and games challenge the patriarchal framework in Chinese society."

Het doel van het onderzoek is om meer inzicht te krijgen in de overtuigingen en ervaringen van een docent bij het motiveren van studenten om te gaan lezen. Met een combinatie van kwantitatief onderzoek (online vragenlijsten) en kwalitatief onderzoek (semi-gestructureerde interviews) is onderzocht hoe vaardig docenten zich voelen bij het bevorderen van leesmotivatie. Uit de vragenlijsten blijkt dat respondenten zichzelf vaardig achten om bepaalde onderwijstaken uit te voeren voor hogere leesmotivatie (efficacy expectations) en ook positief zijn over hun verwachting over de gevolgen van deze inspanningen bij studenten (outcome expectations). Uit de interviews blijkt dat er een discrepantie is tussen de mate van teacher efficacy die docenten hebben en de ervaringen die zij hebben met het bevorderen van leesmotivatie in de praktijk. De uitdagingen die blijken uit de antwoorden van docenten zijn: een gebrek aan faciliteiten voor geschikt leesmateriaal, te weinig ruimte in het curriculum door nadruk op toetsing en een gebrek aan ondersteuning vanuit hogere lagen uit de organisatie. De positieve factoren in het realiseren van leesmotivatie zijn de autonomie die docenten ervaren, de samenwerking met collega’s uit de vakgroep en de kennis van leesmotivatie die docenten hebben en de waarde die zij hieraan hechten."

Smashing statues: the performative and archaeological dimensions of collective vandalism.,"['Rigon, Gustavo']","['Minnaert, Toine']",2022-10-19T00:00:40Z,EN,"['performance; dramaturgy; archaeology; postcolonial, museums; statues; vandalism; Black Lives Matter']",Arts and Society,"Violence against statues and monuments as a form of radical activism is not new. However, in 2020, During Black Lives Matter protests, the media covered a series of collective iconoclastic attacks, commonly known as vandalism, where more than five hundred statues and memorials around the world were defaced, modified, or destroyed by artists and activist citizens. The topple down of Colston statue in Bristol culminated in the exhibition of its remains at the local history archive, Mshed Museum, where the formation of archaeology through performative violence is observed. To investigate this formation, it is questioned how vandalism, as a situated, subversive social performance, can provide potential insights into our experience with the past when visiting museums.
Performance theory and notions of archaeology seek to elucidate heritage formation through subversive social performances. Dramaturgical analysis, usually applied to art performances, allows the mapping and interpretation of all the possible theatrical means employed in the configuration of the topple down of a statue as a social performance, extending its lenses to the display and archival of survival remains in an institutional context. In the last decades, community and identity crises have faced museums, putting into question their definition and societal relevance. Here, curatorial practices come to the fore in the reassemble and recontextualization of the performance of the past. Thus it holds museums accountable for how these curatorial statements are displayed.
The interdisciplinarity found in the case study at stake is seen as significant to foment the insights this research aims to reach. As argued, both performative and archaeological dimensions of vandalism are, ultimately, social and cultural constructions of reality. Its study is considered essential for enriching our experience with past-present narratives and the formation of contemporary society."
Erfgoed voor alle beschaafde mensen. De wederopbouw van Ieper na de Eerste Wereldoorlog als basisvoorbeeld voor toekomstig post-conflict herstel van cultureel erfgoed,"['Snoek, Maaike']","['Plets, G.F.J.']",2022-10-19T00:00:35Z,NL,['Cultuurgeschiedenis; Eerste Wereldoorlog; Ieper; Cultureel Erfgoed;'],Cultuurgeschiedenis van modern Europa,"Hoewel het lijkt alsof de binnenstad en grote markt van Ieper al eeuwen dezelfde uitstraling heeft, is dit niet het geval. Een groot gedeelte van de twintigste eeuw hebben delen van deze markt namelijk in puin gelegen. De bevolking van Ieper heeft bijna een halve eeuw gedaan over de wederopbouw van de Lakenhallen van de stad na de complete vernietiging van het gebouw en de rest van de stad na de Eerste Wereldoorlog, waardoor het nu lijkt alsof er nooit schade aan de stad is geweest. Schijn bedriegt echter. De opzet van het project is grotendeels vormgegeven door de Vlaamse architect Jules Coomans in samenwerking met de burgemeester van Ieper, René Colaert. In het onderstaande werk wordt de opzet, uitvoering en voltooiing van die wederopbouw werkzaamheden uiteengezet en getoetst aan de theorie van Sultan Barakat in zijn werk ‘Necessary conditions for integrated approaches to the post-conflict recovery of cultural heritage in the Arab World’ (2021). In dit artikel noemt hij vijf noodzakelijke voorwaarden die bij moeten dragen aan het herstel van een samenleving of stad na een gewelddadig conflict. Hierbij focust Barakat zich vooral op gebieden in Noord-Afrika en het Midden-Oosten (MENA) maar door zijn theorie te toetsen aan een andere situatie met andere omstandigheden, zoals die in Ieper na de Eerste Wereldoorlog ruim honderd jaar geleden, kan worden gekeken in hoeverre de theorie van Barakat steekhoudt buiten de MENA-gebieden. In hoeverre voldoet Ieper aan de voorwaarden die Barakat stelt in zijn artikel? Wat zowel in het werk van Barakat terugkomt als uit de bronnen geraadpleegd voor deze scriptie is een sterke lokale verankering: de wederopbouw moet met lokale bewoners en instellingen worden aangegaan om te voorkomen dat de wederopbouw slechts een leeg omhulsel is en het onderliggende conflict niet kan worden opgelost."
Pro- and anti-vaccination arguments in the online  vaccination discourse on Twitter,"['Merts, Jacintha']","['Stok, Marijn']",2022-10-18T15:00:45Z,EN,"['Vaccine, vaccination, anti-vaccination, anti-vaxx,  pro-vaccination, pro-vaxx, proponent, vaccine hesitancy, herd  immunity, vaccine damage, Twitter, tweets, belief, attitude,  health, freedom']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Background. Vaccinations help prevent the spread of diseases
and save healthcare costs. Herd immunity exists at a high level 
of vaccine coverage and improves individual and community 
health and can be jeopardized by anti-vaccination movements. 
According to literature, anti-vaccination proponents generally 
base their arguments on beliefs and mistrust while provaccination proponents rely on science. Both pro- and antivaccination movements impact the online vaccination discourse 
and can influence vaccine-related decisions. Understanding the 
arguments used by Twitter users can combat the online antivaccination movement and increase willingness to vaccinate, 
resulting in herd immunity and improved health outcomes.
Methodology. A vaccination decision-making framework is 
created to visualize various arguments used in vaccination 
debates. This framework is based on qualitative studies from 
literature and used as a coding scheme for vaccination tweets. 
Prior to this research, a selection of 2,000 tweets was gleaned 
from database containing 85,000 tweets. These selected tweets 
were coded manually in Excel by six coders in various categories 
including pro-vaccination, anti-vaccination and hesitant. Any 
doubts were discussed among the coders. Then, these pro-, 
anti- and hesitant vaccination tweets were coded top-down on 
content, substantiated by bottom-up codes. Solely the pro- and 
anti-vaccination tweets were coded in NVivo based on the 
aforementioned vaccination decision-making framework.
Finally, in data analysis the pro- and anti-vaccination arguments 
were compared to each other. 
Results. In pro-vaccination, the most mentioned themes were 
preventive health beliefs, risk, health freedom, media, 
reliability, vaccine effectiveness and social experiences. In anti-
vaccination, the most mentioned themes were vaccine safety, 
trust in government and social experiences As expected, provaccination arguments are more based on science while antivaccination arguments are more focused on beliefs and 
mistrust. Several themes were unmentioned, implying that 
Twitter users value them less than expected in literature 
studies. 
Discussion. Differences in outcomes between this research and 
the literature can be explained by country, tweet selection, the 
time period of the tweets and study population. Strengths of 
this research include the representation of reality, inter-coder 
reliability in Excel, an interdisciplinary approach and the jointly 
analysis of pro- and anti-vaccination tweets. Limitations of this 
research include the lack of inter-coder reliability in NVivo, little 
variation and validity in the (amount of) tweets, the difficulty of 
interpretation of tweets and the fact that the current COVID-19 
pandemic might have changed the attention, willingness and 
hesitancy towards vaccines. Further research would include a 
more explorative analysis on the influence of Twitter on vaccine 
decision-making.
Conclusion. In line with the literature, the arguments in provaccination tweets are majorly based on science and the antivaccination tweets are more based on beliefs, attitudes and 
mistrust."
The moderation of neuroticism on the relationship between nature exposure and working memory,"['Grootveld, Jonna']","['Gerritsen, L.']",2022-10-19T00:00:28Z,EN,['Nature exposure; working memory; neuroticism; nature walks; stress reduction theory; SRT; attention restoration theory; ART; cognitive function'],Clinical Psychology,"This study aimed to investigate the effects of different times of nature exposure on working memory and if neuroticism would moderate this relationship. It is already known that nature has positive effects on well-being. For instance, it may improve one’s immune system and decrease anxiety and rumination. With the growing urbanization and other factors such as long work hours that lead people to visit greenery less, it is promising to see if nature exposure improves people’s cognitive function. It has been proposed by the Attention Restoration Theory (ART) by Kaplan that directed attention resources may be replenished by natural stimuli, as they do not require much cognitive control. The Stress Reduction Theory by Ulrich on the other hand, suggests that nature reduces stress levels and in turn replenishes cognitive function. As persons scoring high on neuroticism tend to experience stress and negative emotion more easily, it could be so that nature exposure has fewer positive effects for this population. The results showed that nature had a positive effect on working memory scores, unless of the duration of the exposure. This finding suggests that short exposure to nature already replenishes higher-order attention functions. Neither neuroticism led to significant differences. Also, weather circumstances did not lead to different outcomes. These findings can correspond with the ART, suggesting that natural stimuli do not demand much cognitive control, and in turn, replenish directed attention resources. However, from colleagues, it has been known that nature had a positive effect on positive affect. So, the SRT could also be suitable through a possible mechanism of affect. Future studies are needed to confirm a causal relationship and a suitable theoretical background."

Based on literary studies and ethnographic fieldwork, I argue that two interrelated processes related to EU border and migration management can be witnessed:  An “internationalisation of migration management as a form of transnational governmentality” and “a local turn” in the execution of migration management since 2021. Through describing these processes and explaining the mechanisms that enable them, this thesis sheds light on the general process of EU border externalisation and its consequences on migration flows in the Western Balkans and on the state of BiH."

The present research assessed the extent to which local interprofessional practice around the facilitation of informal care was influenced by three ‘relational factors’ (clarity about professional roles, shared goals, and effective communication) and by two structural characteristics of the collaboration (formality of the collaboration and the specific professions included). These conditions are empirically related to outcomes of interprofessional collaboration.
Existing data were analysed, collected by two Dutch Knowledge centres with expertise in Long Term Care (Vilans) and Social Care (Movisie) to evaluate their joint Programme ‘In for Informal Care’ which aims to improve local collaboration around informal care. Data consisted of 20 evaluative interviews and surveys among 180 health care and social care professionals who participated in the programme. The analysis confirms the importance of the three relational factors for collaboration around informal care. Currently, these three conditions are not fully met, and activities of the participants were aimed at meeting these necessary conditions. In addition, no formal collaboration exists between relevant professionals and coordination of activities is often challenging. Coordination is influenced by relational factors as well as the structural characteristics of the collaboration. 
The results provide insight into the necessary conditions for successful collaboration and into some important facilitators and barriers. Deliberate action of municipalities and organizations in Health and Social care is needed to explicate and negotiate professional roles and shared aims among professionals, to discuss any threats to professional identity imposed by the new demands, to create the conditions for effective communication, and to facilitate coordination of activities between all relevant professionals."

people have doubts about vaccination and choose to 
delay or refuse vaccine uptake even though vaccines are 
readily available, is one of the greatest threats to global

into the vaccination discourse to get a better 
understanding of why people refuse vaccination. This 
study aims to examine the sentiments that are expressed 
in the online vaccination discourse and to research the 
differences in sentiments between the pro-vaccination 
majority and the anti-vaccination movement. Dutchlanguage vaccination-related messages were collected 
from Twitter ranging from January 2012 until June 2019 
and categorised which resulted in 57 anti-vaccination 
tweets and 354 pro-vaccination tweets. A sentiment 
analysis and qualitative content analysis was conducted. 
Both anti- and pro-vaccination tweets contained strong 
subjectivity and polarity scores, thus tweets on both 
sides of the discourse were strong in sentiment and no 
meaningful difference was found. Anti- and provaccination adherents both used more negative feelings 
than positive feeling words in their tweets. The 
sentiments in both anti- and pro-vaccination tweets 
related to a strong sense of in-group identity. Sentiments 
expressed in tweets posted by anti-vaccination adherents 
related to the presence of reactance. These findings 
increase insight into the relevance of social identity and 
reactance in the decision-making of anti-vaccination 
adherents and suggest that more attention should be 
paid to the vaccination discourse on social media 
platforms such as Twitter. More insight into the online 
vaccination discourse could improve the understanding of 
how vaccine hesitancy develops and spreads which is 
needed to effectively counter vaccine hesitancy"
The Mental Wellbeing of Women living with HIV in South Africa: the Ndlovu Cohort Study,"['Klein, Nora']","['Wit, John de']",2022-10-18T15:00:43Z,EN,"['HIV, mental wellbeing, women, South Africa, Ndlovu cohort study']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: Prior research has shown that women in South Africa are more vulnerable to 
HIV infection due to gender inequalities. Additionally, people living with HIV (PLHIV) are 
more likely to suffer from mental illnesses than people who do not live with HIV. 
Furthermore, HIV-related stigma is considered to be a risk factor for mental illness among 
PLHIV. The socioeconomic position as well as relationship status also influence the mental 
health of PLHIV, and specifically women. This research will clarify the interplay between sex 
and mental health outcomes while analyzing whether sex causes differences in education, 
employment, and relationship status, which in turn may cause differences in HIV-related 
stigma which altogether may affect the mental health outcomes of PLHIV in South Africa.
Methods: Using data from the baseline questionnaire of the Ndlovu cohort study conducted 
in Moutse area, South Africa, this study performs a serial multiple mediation analysis on 855 
PLHIV following the four-step model by Baron & Kenny (1986).
Results: No serial multiple mediation was observed. Relationship status is the only 
mediator between sex and mental health as the beta coefficient of sex decreased from B = -
.080 (p =.011) to B = -.149 (p <.001).
Conclusion: The findings indicated that women living with HIV are more likely to be in an 
unstable relationship and that it may increase mental health issues. As in patriarchal systems 
an unstable relationship may come with other disadvantages caused by gender inequalities, 
there may be many more reasons for increased mental health issues among women living 
with HIV. Therefore, it is important to continue research on this topic and implement 
policies and interventions to alleviate the mental burden on women living with HIV in South 
Africa."

white, middle-class fathers. Research on ethnic and class diversity within fatherhood ideals and 
framing is sparse. This research is focused on the framing of fatherhood in Dutch newspapers

what types of masculinities were found in the news articles. 60 newspaper articles were 
collected from databank LexisNexis and analysed in QSR Nvivo 12.6. Four ideal types of 
fatherhood were distinguished and only the involved father was clearly represented in the 
newspapers articles. Regarding masculinity types, predominately the neotraditional type of 
masculinity was represented in the newspaper articles. It appears that there is a tension between 
the involved father and the neotraditional type of masculinity whereas the breadwinner role is 
central to this concept. Furthermore, work culture, managers and the company are key aspects 
for fathers to use the birth leave or not. In other words, the workplace plays an important role.
The results showed that there was little to no diversity within the articles in terms of ethnicity 
or class."
Intentions to vaccinate and follow guidelines against COVID-19 in the Netherlands in light of the 21st century’s first global pandemic: The determining role of protection motivation and micro and macro framing,"['Losacco, Francesca']","['Stok, Marijn']",2022-10-24T14:00:47Z,EN,['vaccine hesitancy; protection motivation; micro-macro perspectives; threat and coping appraisal'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Introduction of the new COVID-19 vaccinations presents a critical opportunity to effectively tackle the pandemic. However, high vaccination uptake and preventive measure compliance are crucial to successfully reduce COVID-19 transmission. While previous studies have illustrated a presence of international COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, there remains little research into underlying determinants. This study aimed to provide insight into potential determinants behind vaccination and preventive health intentions by investigating the role played by motivation and perceptions of the self in relation to larger society. Findings aim to pave the way for effective pandemic planning and targeting strategies. 

This study investigated the role played by protection motivation and micro and macro perspective framing upon intentions to vaccinate and follow measures against COVID-19 in the Netherlands. An experimental design was employed by manipulating the threat of COVID-19, called the threat appraisal, and effectiveness of the new vaccines, called the coping appraisal. This was to determine which condition is associated with the highest vaccination and preventive health behaviour intentions. The study collected 895 responses through online surveys and analysed the findings through a full factorial design analysis. 

	The study demonstrated that a high coping appraisal linked to high intentions to get vaccinated. Effects of the threat and micro – macro manipulations did not have statistically significant effects on vaccination intentions or intentions to follow measures. Similarly, the coping appraisal manipulation did not have a statistically significant effect upon intentions to follow measures. However, additional analyses showed that higher intentions to vaccinate and to follow measures exist amongst people aged between 51 and 60 years old compared to those aged 30 and under. The analyses furthermore showed that higher intentions to vaccinate and follow measures existed amongst those with a more politically left than right orientation. Higher intentions to vaccinate additionally existed amongst employed people compared to unemployed people, those who had received secondary, university and other higher education compared to those who had only completed primary school, and Christians compared to Muslims and non-religious individuals. Lastly, higher intentions to follow measures were expressed by women than by men. The study concluded that a high coping appraisal is associated with higher intentions to vaccinate. This suggests importance of ease of vaccination and measure compliance."

Simultaneously, it becomes clear that providing adequate professional support for this group is challenging. In the period 2029-2021, K2 initiated the ‘Learning Trajectories’, aimed to provide knowledge and skills to professionals to improve support to vulnerable people in becoming self-sufficient. This study evaluated the extent to which the Learning Trajectories in De Bilt, the Utrechtse Heuvelrug, Zeist and Noord-Limburg succeed in accomplishing this. Influence of the Learning Trajectories was examined directly on the attitudes, social norms, perceived behaviors and indirectly on the intentions of professionals to provide the needed support. Furthermore, the role of bureaucratic and organizational environments on the application of the intentions was investigated. A qualitative research design was handled. Between mid-April and half of May 2021, fifteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with professionals that participated in the Learning Trajectories. Findings show the Learning Trajectories positively changed attitudes, perceived behavioral and intentions of professionals to provide support related to decreasing stress of vulnerable people, working integrally with other professionals and providing tailor-made support to the client. Social norms and intentions towards establishing a meaningful professional-client relationship were not influenced, as the Learning Trajectories did not focus on these factors. Bureaucratic and organizational environments hinder providing adequate support. In conclusion, the Learning Trajectories are effective in improving professional support to vulnerable people in becoming self-sufficient. Presentations, peer mentors , actors and casuistry meetings enhanced knowledge and skills, thereby increasing intentions towards adequate support. Determining the effective elements provides insights for similar interventions. Ultimately, this will improve professional support. However, effectiveness is hindered by bureaucratic and organizational environments. Future research is necessary on this relationship.

LHBT en de katholieke kerk: Onderzoek naar de praktijk van pastores in Nederland,"['Boeschoten, Pieter']","['Kennedy, James']",2022-11-15T00:00:36Z,NL,['LHBT; homoseksualiteit; queer; katholieke kerk; katholieke leer; theologie; religie; Nederland; Nederlandse cultuur; LGBT; homosexuality; catholic church; catholic teaching; doctrines; theology; religion; the Netherlands; Dutch culture;'],Neerlandistiek,"In deze scriptie wordt onderzocht hoe katholieke pastores in Nederland omgaan met LHBT in de praktijk. Zowel de katholieke kerk als de zichtbaarheid van LHBT zijn belangrijke onderdelen van de Nederlandse cultuur, maar soms lijken deze zaken tegenover elkaar te staan. In interviews vertellen zeven pastores hoe zij zich verhouden tot LHBT in de kerkelijke praktijk en tot de katholieke leer. De geïnterviewden zijn pastoraal werkers, priesters en diakens die pastorale functies hebben in parochies door heel Nederland.

In de inleiding wordt de verhouding tussen de rooms-katholieke kerk en LHBT in Nederland toegelicht. Er wordt vervolgens ingegaan op de discussie rond LHBT in de christelijke theologie. Hierbij licht ik de argumenten van pastor John McNeill toe, een voorvechter voor homo-acceptatie in de katholieke kerk tijdens de Gay Liberation Movement, en leg ik uit hoe veel van deze argumenten later zijn uitgebreid en uitgewerkt. Daarnaast bevat de inleiding een beschrijving van de onderzoeksmethode.

In hoofdstuk 1 geef ik een kleine introductie in het katholieke geloof en de katholiek leer. In dit hoofdstuk zal ik uitleggen wat de betekenis is van de Bijbel, de traditie en het leergezag voor LHBT en welke discussie erover is. In paragraaf 1.1 komt Bijbelexegese aan bod, waarbij ik mij beperk tot het verhaal van Sodom en Gomorra, het scheppingsverhaal, de brieven van Paulus en het verhaal van David en Jonathan. Paragraaf 1.2 gaat over de traditie en het leergezag. Hierbij komen verschillende documenten uit het Vaticaan aan bod, maar de nadruk ligt op de Catechismus van de Katholieke Kerk.

Hoofdstuk 2 en 3 bevatten de resultaten van het onderzoek. In hoofdstuk 2 vertellen de pastores wat ze tegenkomen in de praktijk, en hoe ze daarmee omgaan. Hoofdstuk 3 gaat dieper in op hoe deze praktijk zich verhoudt tot de katholieke leer. Hierbij ligt in paragraaf 3.1 de focus op ervaringen met mensen en hoe dat hun kijk op de leer heeft gevormd. In paragraaf 3.2 wordt er gefocust op religieuze overtuigingen. In paragraaf 3.3 zoom ik in op de discussie over de leer, en welke uiteenlopende standpunten daarin genomen worden.

In de conclusie categoriseer ik de verschillende verhalen van de pastores en schets ik de grote lijnen van de verschillende manieren waarop er over LHBT gedacht wordt. Er zijn grote verschillen hoe men zich verhoudt tot LHBT in de katholieke kerk, maar geen van de pastores wil LHBT’ers uitsluiten. We kunnen concluderen dat pastores LHBT’ers welkom willen heten op grond van twee typen argumenten. Het eerste type is het pastorale argument. De pastores vinden dat ze pastoraal moeten handelen naar iedereen, en dus ook naar LHBT’ers. De argumenten zijn bijvoorbeeld vergelijkingen met andere ‘zonden’, waar mensen ook niet op afgerekend worden. De leer staat dan niet in de weg om pastoraal te handelen naar LHBT’ers. Wat pastoraal handelen betekent voor de praktijk verschilt. Het andere type argument gaat juist wel over de leer. Sommige pastores verzetten zich actief tegen de leer. Een voorbeeld van dit type argument is dat volgens sommige pastores LHBT hoort bij Gods schepping en dat het ontkennen of afwijzen daarvan, het afwijzen is van Gods schepping. Bij de meeste pastores komen beide typen argumenten naar voren."
Vreemdeling of nieuwkomer. Hoe door middel van taal het plenaire debat over inburgering in de Tweede Kamer tussen 15 maart 2017 en 17 maart 2021 vorm kreeg en hoe deze in verhouding stond tot het maatschappelijk debat.,"['Gijzen, Lisa']","['Besamusca-Douwes, Emmeline']",2022-11-15T00:00:39Z,NL,['Inburgering; integratie; tweede kamer; discours; debat; politiek; maatschappelijk; text mining; discoursanalyse; identiteit'],Neerlandistiek,"Nieuwkomers in Nederland moeten inburgeren, omdat de overheid het belangrijk vindt dat zij kunnen 
participeren. Op het inburgeringsexamen is in de Nederlandse samenleving veel kritiek. De vragen in 
het examen over de ongeschreven gedragsregels worden bijvoorbeeld normatief en etnocentrisch 
genoemd. Omdat Nederland een parlementaire democratie kent, zou het politieke debat een 
weerspiegeling moeten zijn van het maatschappelijke debat. Om te onderzoeken hoe het politieke 
debat over inburgering eruit ziet en hoe dat zich verhoudt tot het maatschappelijke debat, staat in dit 
onderzoek de volgende vraag centraal:

Hoe ziet het plenaire debat over inburgering eruit in de Tweede Kamer tussen 15 maart 2017 
en 17 maart 2021 en hoe verhoudt zich dat tot het maatschappelijk debat?

Uit eerder onderzoek bleek dat de voorwaarden voor een succesvolle integratie ter discussie staan. 
Waar eerst het aanleren van een nationale identiteit centraal stond, ervaart men dat sinds de 21e eeuw 
steeds meer als problematisch (Broeders, Kremer en Meurs, 2008; Dagevos en Grundel, 2013; De Hart, 
2019b; De Hart, 2019c; Leerssen, 2015). Integratie, dat volgens Smeets en Steijlen (2006) uit vier 
dimensies bestaat – de structurele, de culturele, de interactieve en de identificationele – kan volgens 
Broeders, Kremer en Meurs (2008) het best bereikt worden door te investeren in het proces van 
identificatie in plaats van het aanleren van een identiteit.

Middels het taalgebruik van de partijen in de plenaire debatten, is onderzoek gedaan naar de uitingen 
over inburgering en de visie die daaruit blijkt. Taal construeert namelijk de werkelijkheid (Van den Berg, 
2004). Patronen in het taalgebruik hebben vaak als onbewust gevolg dat ze verwachtingen creëren van 
de werkelijkheid en dat deze verwachtingen ook waargemaakt worden.

Uit het onderzoek bleek dat er in de plenaire debatten, met als onderwerp Migratie en integratie, vooral 
veel gesproken werd over immigratie in haar algemeenheid en over de vraag wie er wel en niet in 
Nederland mag blijven. Inburgering stond in veel mindere mate centraal. Wanneer het wel over 
inburgering ging, stonden ook daar de formele aspecten hoger op de agenda dan de inhoud. Het ging
dan vooral om het integratieprobleem en de vragen van het onderdeel Kennis van de Nederlandse 
Maatschappij werden als nutteloos ervaren. De voornaamste oplossing die werd geboden is het herzien 
en het aanpassen van dit onderdeel.

Al met al was de constatering dat er tussen het maatschappelijk en het politiek debat een missing link
is, in aanvulling op de twee missing links van Te Velde (2008). Het politieke debat sluit dus niet naadloos 
aan op het maatschappelijke debat. De conclusie kan echter niet als absoluut ervaren worden, omdat 
het corpus relatief klein was. Volgend onderzoek, met meer data, zou dit moeten uitwijzen."
The role of lifestyle in socioeconomic inequities in physical limitations in activities daily living among elderly in the Netherlands,"['Witsmeer, Sophie']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2022-11-15T00:00:41Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: Physical limitations (PL) in activities daily living (ADL) significantly predict the need for assistance, caregiving, nursing home placement, and health care utilization. Therefore, it is important to reduce the socioeconomic inequities in PL in ADL for elderly. The current study is focused on socioeconomic inequity in PL in ADL and the role of lifestyle behaviours, namely diet, exercise, and smoking.  

Methods: The data of a large-scale postal survey, for the longitudinal GLOBE study, among a stratified sample of the adult population (age 25–75 years) of Eindhoven and surrounding cities in October 2004 (N = 4785; response rate 64.4%) is used. In the current study participants above 65 are included. One participant was excluded because there was missing data for gender (N = 1046). A mediation analysis was conducted to see if diet, exercise, and smoking mediate the relationship between PL in ADL and the socioeconomic status (SES) of elderly in the Netherlands. 

Results: SES had a significant negative relationship with PL in ADL (b=-.032, 95% CI [-.061, -.002], t= -2.113, p= .035). Exercise had a negative significant relationship with SES as well as PL in ADL. A partial mediation is present. For exercise as mediator the total effect is -.045. Smoking had a significant relation with SES, but no significant relation with PL in ADL. Diet had no significant relation with SES or PL in ADL. 

Conclusions: Elderly with a higher SES had fewer PL in ADL than elderly in a lower SES. Elderly in a higher SES exercise more which leads to fewer PL in ADL. More research about lifestyle factors that mediate the relationship between SES and PL in ADL of elderly is needed. There is also a need for more research on the explanations for the differences in lifestyle factors across elderly in different socioeconomic groups."

Facilitators in the collaboration between the secondary care and the sport sector in order to promote physical activity","['Smit, Eline']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2022-11-15T00:00:46Z,EN,"['Prevention, neighbourhoud sports coach, collaboration, facilitators']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Participating in regular physical activity has positive effects on physical, mental and social health. Guidance towards sports activities is needed because existing sports promotion programs hardly reach the target group. A key role for promoting physical activity and guidance towards sports/exercise programs is ascribed to the neighborhood sports coaches (NSCs). Intersectoral collaboration (ISC) between the healthcare sector and the PA sector, is expected to improve the health of individuals and increase awareness of the health implications of policy decisions and organisational practice within and among these different sectors. The starting point of this research is the Health Alliances (HALL) framework, which identifies factors that facilitate the success of alliances. 
	To gain understanding of the facilitators of intersectoral collaboration between lifestyle projects in hospitals and neighbourhood sports coaches to endorse an active lifestyle of patients, a qualitative methodology was used in conducting in-depth interviews with secondary health care professionals and sport professionals [N=10]. The findings of this paper show that an organizational focus on ISC was crucial for the creation and sustainability of an ISC. Also, training secondary health professionals is important in ensuring the referral of patients to a NSCs. A wish for the future concerning the ISC was a national communication platform, where professionals from the medical sector and PA sector can find each other. 
	The main implication of this study, is that it can be seen as an expansion of the existing research on the ISC between secondary health projects and the PA sector. In addition, the facilitating factors can serve as an incentive for hospitals and NSCs to start an ISC or improve the existing ISC. Future research should explore the most effective ways of NSCs to communicate with patients and organizations who offer PA activities, in order to effectively refer people who could advantage of a better lifestyle"
Youth and Informal Mentoring: The Mediating Role of Shared Decision-Making on Youth Resilience,"['Tesch, Luisa']","['Weinberg, D.W.']",2022-11-15T00:00:44Z,EN,"['Resilience, Shared decision making, mediation, informal mentoring']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Background The study of resilience seeks to understand how some young people grow up in adversity end up doing better than their peers in similar circumstances. Factors in the social environment may support resilience in young people from multi-problem families. For young people in youth care having an informal mentor, rather than care as usual, may increase youth resilience, through increasing their quality of relationship with adults and their perception of shared decision making (SDM). Aim The aim of the study is to explore the mechanisms that lead to resilience in a sample of young people in youth care. The possible mediating effect of SDM on the relationship between having an informal mentor (compared to care as usual) and youth resilience was examined. Additionally, for participants with a mentor, SDM was examined as a mediator between the quality of the relationship between mentor and youth resilience. Methods Data from the GRIP project was used. Participants were 67 adolescents in youth care with a multi-problem family background aged 10 to 18 (treatment group with a mentor, n = 39 and care as usual group, n =28). Results were collected using self-report questionnaires: CYRM-12 to measure youth resilience, PARA to assess relationship quality (mentor group only) and SRS to determine shared decision-making. Two mediation analyses were conducted. Results Analysis suggest that young people who have a mentor have higher SDM which partly explains why they have higher resilience. There was no mediation effect of SDM on the link between relationship quality between the mentor and the young person and resilience. Conclusion Findings support the idea that young people from multi-problem families with informal mentors have higher resilience because they feel more involved in decision making. This suggests informal mentors can play an important role in the social system for such young people."

A qualitative approach to explore the service-users' perspectives on antipsychotic medication and its role within the personal recovery framework,"['Tromp, Daniel']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-11-16T00:00:37Z,EN,[],Geneeskunde,"Background: Personal recovery, as defined by the CHIME framework (connectedness, hope, identity, meaning and purpose, and empowerment), is becoming prominent in mental health care policy. The service-users’ value placed upon antipsychotic medication within the personal recovery framework is unclear. 
Aim: Insight into the individual’s perspectives on antipsychotic medication is needed to gain a holistic understanding of the implications of antipsychotic therapy and its interaction with the personal recovery framework. 
Method: Using the Psychiatry Story Bank’s database: participant-guided stories were used, collected through open, semistructured interviews. Narratives of 11 participants with a psychotic disorder were analysed using a thematic analytic approach within a phenomenological-constructivist framework. 
Results: (1) The role of antipsychotic medication varies in different situations and is dependent on the service-users’ needs and circumstances. (2) Service-users desire a holistic approach to treatment with antipsychotic medication as part of a comprehensive treatment package, including the support from professionals. (3) Side effects can have potential lifedisrupting consequences; service-user’s perceive medication to be ideal in the case of negligible side-effects. (4) Stigma is experienced both inside and outside the mental health services, leading to feelings of devaluation. 
Conclusion: This study highlights the great variety in experiences related to antipsychotic medication. Interactions with the personal recovery framework were identified, posing both openings and barriers to processes of personal recovery. In order to strive for personal recovery, it is essential to put emphasis on the service-users’ own specific set of needs and circumstances."
The effect of spatial frequency on faster detection of emotional expressions in visual search,"['Lang, Wenkai']","['Stuit, Sjoerd']",2022-11-16T00:00:39Z,EN,"['emotional expressions, emotion detection, visual search, anger superiority effect, spatial frequency']",Applied Cognitive Psychology,"Facial expressions are adaptive social and communicative tools. In some early investigations of expression detection, both anger superiority effect and happiness superiority effect were reported. Several attempts were made to resolve the contradictory reports of emotion superiority effects in visual search and a well-supported explanation is that preferential detection of emotion can be attributed to simple visual features of faces. The current research focused on the spatial frequency (SF) of facial expressions to test if the reported inconsistencies are related to SF differences between the expressions. To do so, emotional faces were manipulated at the level of SF content by replacing original Fourier magnitude spectrum and four kinds of faces containing new SF information were created as stimuli. An online visual search task was conducted to examine preferential emotion detection. The results revealed the anger superiority effect for faces containing only main SF features that separate emotional expressions, faces with average magnitude spectra per expression category, or faces with 1/f noise frequency. However, ASE did not reveal when main SF features that separate emotional expressions were removed from faces. Such findings suggest that SF content can produce the emotion superiority effect when it can provide emotion-related important information in the detection of emotion."

Nevertheless, emotion regulation goals describe the preceding motives that individuals pursue to experience the desired emotions. Although previous research yielded promising results, a dearth of studies persists concerning the examination of emotion goals in relation to potential influencing factors and specific social circumstances. The present dissertation intends to investigate the relationship between narcissistic personality and the emotion regulation goal to experience sadness when reconciling with a romantic partner. Additionally, this work discusses whether sex moderates the main relationship. 
Method: Therefore, full-age participants (N = 53) who were in a relationship and residing in the Netherlands completed an online self-report survey. This questionnaire included a narcissism instrument, an emotion goal questionnaire, and gathered demographic information. 
Results: However, no significant results were obtained through a moderated regression analysis. Nevertheless, when inspected with caution, a weak negative trend might be noticeable. 
Conclusions: Although neither for the relationship between narcissism and the emotion goal of sadness nor for the moderation through sex differences any significant indications could be found, this study still provides valuable insights into emotion goal dynamics. Hence, the current research analysed relevant findings and produced promising contributions to the relatively young scientific discipline of emotion regulation goals."

These methods include heuristics with provable guarantees to come as close as possible to the optimal solution in polynomial time. Nonetheless, one of the most important methods to solve ∃R-complete problems is called gradient descent. Curiously, there was no attempt yet to solve the Art Gallery Problem with gradient descent. By aiming to maximise the area seen by the guards in the Art Gallery Problem, we get a continuous cost function, which allows us to compute the gradient. Using the gradient and other heuristics inspired from neural networks, we try to solve the Art Gallery Problem practically using gradient descent. Specifically, we aim to use the library CGAL. Implementations show how feasible this approach is. We visualise the results and discuss the performance of the algorithm on different input shapes and sizes."

From all measured leadership types only servant leadership was significantly related to two of the wellbeing aspects, namely engagement and burnout. In the qualitative phase it was found that public servants experienced social isolation as a result of the intense homeworking situation.

Protein interactions can be studied by a variety of high- and low-resolution methods. Native MS, an MS based technique where proteins native conformation and interactions are conserved, is a valuable tool to identify and quantify protein interactions. Unlike other methods, native MS does not require labelling for identification and qualification of different species in a sample, which makes it suitable for the analysis of proteins that are extracted from patient material. Additionally, native MS is particularly useful when analysing heterogenous samples. This review focusses on recent innovations to extent the native MS toolbox for the study of protein interactions. The showcased innovations, which are both online and offline, allow for extended usage of native MS, for example for the analysis of (thermo)dynamic properties. Also sample preparation and fragmentation innovations are discussed. Although innovation is rapid and there seems to be no limit, we believe that the current native MS toolbox can be exploited for the functional analysis of heterogenous samples, for example caused by post translational modifications or a mix of competitive binding partners."
Microbial biodegradation of the “unbreakable” fluorine-carbon bond,"['Kamp, Tom van de']","['Wosten, Han']",2022-11-17T00:00:38Z,EN,"['fluorine, microbes, degradation, defluorization']",Environmental Biology,"Fluorinated molecules have been widely used in many industrial sectors. The most produced are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). These molecules are used for coatings to repel stain, grease and water in textiles and kitchen appliances. However, because of their specific molecular properties and the strong C-F bond they are extremely persistent. As a consequence, they accumulate in nature and in drinking water, which is harmful to humans and the environment in general. Current treatment techniques like granular activated carbon (GAC) and reverse osmosis (RO) are extremely expensive and have limitations. Therefore, other mechanisms need to be developed. One of these might be microbial bioremediation. In this thesis bacterial and fungal mechanisms are discussed that are involved in degradation of fluorinated molecules. These mechanisms have great potential for bioremediation of PFASs. However, it also shown that most PFAS species cannot be fully biodegraded by one organism or enzyme. Thus, this thesis also investigated other mechanisms like the use of catalyzed H2O2 propagation (CHP) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). It can be concluded that the future of PFAS bioremediation will be in using mixtures of organisms and / or enzymes. CHP will be one of the most important mechanisms as it can completely degrade PFOA."

The Social Effects of Nature-Inclusive Agriculture Farmers on Their Neighbors’ Attitude Towards NatureInclusive Agriculture,"['Windey, Emma']","['Runhaar, Hens']",2022-11-18T00:00:47Z,EN,['Nature-Inclusive Agriculture; Legitimacy; Knowledge Diffusion; Willingness to adopt; Neighbors'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Biodiversity in the Netherlands is decreasing rapidly and its primary driver is agriculture (Kleijn et al., 2020). In an attempt to slow this trend, the Dutch government published a vision for Nature Inclusive Agriculture(NIA) as the future of farming (Ministerie van Economische Zaken, 2014). However, the uptake of NIA remains low (Vermunt et al., 2022). As a result, it is relevant to understand what factors improve its uptake among Dutch farmers. Literature indicates that social factors are important for the uptake of new practices among farmers. The influence of social norms in the wider agricultural network on individual farmers has been well-studied (E.g.:Case, 1992; Kuhfuss et al., 2016; H. Liu & Ruebeck, 2020; X. Liu et al., 2014; Munasib & Jordan, 2011). However, there is an academic lacuna concerning how early adopters influence the attitudes towards NIA among their local social network. This has led to the research question: How do early adopters of NIA influence the attitude towards NIA practices among their neighboring farmers? This was divided into three sub-questions focused on understanding the NIA farmers’ influence on legitimacy, knowledge diffusion, and adoption interest among their neighboring farmers. Legitimacy and knowledge are important components in understanding the farmers’ attitudes towards NIA. Furthermore, both are prerequisites for increasing the adoption of NIA. 
Due do the lack of previous research, the theoretical framework was built using a range of theoretical concepts. This included concepts such as ‘good farming’ and communities of practice for the sub-question about legitimacy. The bounded normative influence(BNI) framework and boundary spanners for understanding knowledge diffusion, and characteristics important for adoption. The research aimed to empirically verify the theoretical framework. The research followed a case study design, focusing on farmers that received long-term land leases from Staatsbosbeheer(SBB) in exchange for turning their farm nature-inclusive. Data was collected through interviews. 
The results suggested that the NIA farmer's influence is limited in their local environment. This is due to the limited personal acceptance of NIA by neighbors. Furthermore, knowledge diffusion from NIA farmers to neighbors was found to be surface-level. This is because the NIA farmers and conventional neighbors learn in different social networks. Lastly, barriers such as lack of additional land or compensation limited adoption interest among neighbors. However, though the results point to a limited impact of NIA farmers on their neighbors’ attitudes towards NIA, the results also point to the influence of NIA farmers on adoption in their wider network. Overall, the theory proved useful for the legitimacy-related research question. The BNI framework used for understanding knowledge diffusion was modified to include a wider set of circumstances. Lastly, the data was unable to provide significant insight into the theory used for adoption interest. However, the research was able to produce policy recommendations for the Dutch government to enhance NIA uptake."
Temperate Mesophotic Soundscape Diversity and Pollution,"['Stocker, Joëlle']","['Garcia Mayor, Angeles']",2022-11-18T00:00:45Z,EN,['Temperate Mesophotic Ecosystems; Soundscape; Acoustic Diversity; eDNA; Species Richness; Oxygen Minimum Zones'],Sustainable Development,"Temperate Mesophotic Ecosystems have both economic and ecological importance, however, they are currently understudied and scarcely protected, leaving them vulnerable to anthropogenic and environmental disturbances. In recent years, novel methodologies have facilitated the study of these ecosystems. One of these methods is acoustic monitoring, which can measure the diversity and health of ecosystems and can reach depths and species that are not easily accessible using other methods. Several acoustic indices have been developed to measure diversity using the soundscape, however these have mostly been used in terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we analysed the soundscape of two mesophotic ecosystems in the central coast of Chile to assess the reliability of acoustic indices in marine ecosystems by comparing them with diversity measures based on environmental DNA (eDNA). In addition, the effects of the emergence of Oxygen Minimum Zones (OMZ) on the soundscape and acoustic indices was explored. 

To this end, first fish sounds from the soundscape were characterised and counted. Next, from the eDNA data, species richness was calculated and based on the acoustic data, eight indices and a soundscape metric, Sound-Pressure Level (SPL), were measured for two frequency bands. From this, a principal component analysis was performed. The first principal component was subsequently used for further analysis. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted to compare the indices and soundscape to the eDNA data and study the effect of hypoxic conditions on the acoustic indices and SPL.

It was found that there was substantial difference between indices, showing that there is a lot of variability in what they measure. Furthermore, there were similarities in the diversity based on the eDNA and some acoustic indices, and in particular a combination of indices reflected the species richness well. Both sites showed significant variability, with a higher diversity observed near a Marine Protected Area (MPA). Moreover, similar results were found in terms of number of sound-producing species and number of signals detected in the soundscape, both being higher in Algarrobo. Finally, the results showed that there was no significant difference in the results of the indices between oxygen categories."
Developing an inclusive multiplayer rhythm game for visually impaired children,"['Potamianos, Evangelos']","['Hauptmann, Hanna']",2022-11-22T00:00:36Z,EN,['visually impaired children; inclusive play; accessibility; collaboration; social interaction; multiplayer games; rhythm games; game performance; game experience'],Human-Computer Interaction,"Visually Impaired (VI) children face difficulties in their relationships, especially within groups. Moreover, it is likely for them to be marginalized and discriminated at school. Therefore, they lack social skills, since friendships create context for developing these skills. Inclusive multiplayer (computer) games can consist of a safe space for the VI children to share a playful experience with their peers and friends, even if they are sighted. However, there is a lack of these games for the VI audience. This thesis aims to cover that research gap, and provide BongoBeats: Tap with me; an inclusive multiplayer rhythm computer game for VI children in order to assist them to collaborate with their peers. The game was tested in Bartim´eus school; a special school for VI children, with 16 participants, who played in teams of two. Through the experiment, collected quantitative data were collected regarding the teams score, and qualitative data through interviews and observations regarding the game performance, the teams collaboration, and the game experience of the players. Additionally, two expert interviews were conducted in order to collect more in depth feedback regarding the game and possible next steps. In this thesis, it was found that the VI children generally enjoyed the inclusive rhythm multiplayer computer game and collaborated very well, in teams of two. Furthermore, it is suggested for future research on this topic, to provide enough and discrete audio feedback, and to offer a variety of choices in levels and songs/genres within inclusive rhythm multiplayer computer games for VI children. Further research is needed to ensure that the VI children can play the game also with and against their sighted peers, and to monitor the collaboration and the equality between them."
A Behemoth from the Deep: The Discovery and Synthesis of Maitotoxin.,"['Prestifilippo, Gino']","['Wennekes, Tom']",2022-11-21T00:00:34Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Maitotoxin is a unique molecule that is not only the largest known secondary metabolite
that is not a polymer or protein, but is also one of the most potent toxins known to date,
with an LD50 of 50 ng/kg.

First isolated from Gambierdiscus toxicus in 1977 by Yasumoto et al., its structure was
determined in 1993 by Yasumoto et al., and its stereochemistry in 1996 by Kishi et al.
and Tachibana et al.. Although in 2006, it was called into doubt when Gallimore &
Spencer (2006) argued that, based on biosynthetic theories, the stereochemistry was
assigned incorrectly. Following this disagreement, Nicolaou et al. set out to prove that
the originally-proposed structure was correct and undertake the total synthesis of
Maitotoxin as a whole.

This paper discusses how Nicolaou et al. settled the structural dispute in 2007 and
further looks at how the other fragments of Maitotoxin were synthesised during an
eight-year-long synthesis project that was unfortunately cut short in the end due to a
lack of funding. Finally, a plan for connecting the synthesised fragments is proposed
that would allow for the completion of the Maitotoxin ring system."
"The Curious Case of r/Cringetopia: An investigation into the dynamics of cringe, community, and reddit","['Milenovic, Aleksandra']","['Mul, Elize de']",2022-11-19T00:00:35Z,EN,['Cringe; Community; Reddit; Case; Radicalisation; Online Dynamics'],New Media and Digital Culture,"This thesis utilizes a playful “murder-mystery” writing style to academically examine the “death” of a subreddit dedicated to cringe content, r/cringetopia, through the power dynamics of cringe, community, and platform. As these dynamics are considered as media elements involved in facilitating an individual to go down the “alt-right pipeline”, a journey which results in problematic radicalisation, their disruption in a comparatively innocuous research object like r/cringetopia provides ample opportunity for their examination. Each dynamic in question has its own independent theoretical background and process by which it produces certain norms, and through examining the dynamics through the subreddit’s demise, it sheds light on how the play and interplay between them emerges. To accommodate for the notion of productive power involved, a multimodal discourse analysis was selected as the methodology to examine how the dynamics constituted and were constituted by how reddit, community and cringe content were implicated throughout r/Cringetopia’s downfall. The outcome of the analysis revealed that in this instance, the dynamics between community and platform were tightly interwoven together in characterising the downfall, while the dynamic of cringe worked relatively independently due to the construction of its dynamic. Reflecting on the outcome of this thesis provides a further understanding of these dynamics separately and together and carves out space for future research."

Bach; Bach; studentencultuur; studenten; Utrecht; USKO; orkest; koor; cultuurspreiding; identiteit; protestgeneratie; jongerencultuur; cultuurparticipatie'],Cultural History of Modern Europe,"Er gaat in de academische literatuur grote aandacht uit naar de protestgeneratie en de conservatieve reactie. Er is echter weinig aandacht voor de jongeren die niet aan de voorhoede van de veranderingen stonden. Deze scriptie onderzoekt daarom de manier waarop de ‘middenmoot’ van jongeren werd beïnvloed door de grote veranderingen van de jaren zestig. De casus hiervoor is het Utrechts Studenten Koor en Orkest, en hoe de identiteit van het USKO als muziekvereniging veranderde onder invloed van de veranderingen in de samenleving, op het gebied van democratisering binnen het gezelschap, de rol van het USKO als studentengezelschap en muziekgezelschap en het repertoire.
Democratisering in het USKO vond wel degelijk plaats, maar voltrok zich vooral aan het einde van de jaren zestig en het begin van de jaren zeventig. Daarnaast was democratisering binnen het USKO slechts een subtiele verschuiving die een lichte echo was van de ophef in de wijdere buitenwereld.
Het USKO kende meerdere identiteiten als gezelschap voor jongeren, een gezelschap in een studentenwereld, en als muziekgezelschap. Deze drie zaken botsten in de eerste helft van de jaren zestig: het USKO zette zich af tegen de traditionele studentencultuur door middel van haar identiteit als muziekgezelschap, maar kon als gevolg daarvan de opkomende jongerencultuur niet accepteren. In de tweede helft van de jaren zestig veranderden de verhoudingen: klassieke muziek spelen en dansfeesten organiseren binnen dezelfde vereniging sloten elkaar niet langer uit door het veranderde fatsoensideaal. Hierin was de vervanging van de schakelgeneratie door de protestgeneratie van groot belang.
De positie van Bach binnen het USKO bleek eind jaren zestig minder onwankelbaar dan het ooit leek, door de bemoeienis van het Koördinerend Orgaan Studenten Muziekgezelschappen Utrecht (KOSMU) met het USKO-repertoire. Dit leidde er enerzijds toe dat de bijzondere positie van Bach alleen maar sterker werd herbevestigd, terwijl dit anderzijds ook een afname van de hoeveelheid uitgevoerde Bachwerken betekende.
De veranderingen van de buitenwereld en de uitersten in dit veranderingsproces hadden invloed op het USKO, maar de veranderingen zelf werden slechts geleidelijk doorgevoerd en leidden zeker in het begin van de jaren zestig tot worstelingen voor de werkcommissies en besturen. Langzaam maar zeker bewoog het USKO mee met de tijd. Dit laat een fenomeen zien dat niet veel in de academische literatuur behandeld is: de middengroep van jongeren in de jaren zestig veranderden niet net als hun meer zichtbare leeftijdsgenoten plotseling en met ophef en revolutie, maar bewogen geleidelijk mee."
Accelerating development of Dutch thermal energy cooperatives,"['Mesman, Justus']","['Harmsen, Robert']",2022-12-01T01:01:23Z,EN,['Heat transition; thermal energy; energy cooperative; energy community; district heating; systemic barriers'],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"The Introduction discusses the importance of transitioning towards a low-carbon heating system. Thermal energy cooperatives that develop district heating systems are identified as a socio-technical innovation system with high potential to increase public acceptance. This research aims to aid the development of thermal energy cooperatives in the Netherlands through resolving systemic problems, by identifying successful practices in Denmark and Germany. 
The Theory expands on the characteristics of district heating systems and examines current literature on (thermal) energy cooperatives. The theoretical framework on ‘Systemic barriers’ is proposed, which can identify problems that hamper the development of innovation systems. Finally, the institutional contexts of the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany are described. 
The Methods section describes the qualitative research design. 10 case studies were conducted, of which four in the Netherlands, four in Denmark, and two in Germany. The data collection includes documents and 17 semi-structured interviews. Also, the method for data analysis is explained. 
The Results present the practices from Denmark and Germany to overcome the identified systemic barriers in the Netherlands. Multiple systemic barriers were identified, and thermal energy cooperatives are found to be strongly influenced by the environment in which they develop
The Discussion compares the findings of this research with findings from other scientific studies and found that studying energy cooperatives from a socio-technical perspective is useful. Also, limitations are given in relation to recommendations for future research. 
The Conclusion gives recommendations to policymakers, municipalities, public banks, and cooperative organizations. The following practices were found in Denmark and Germany and are recommended for application in the Netherlands:
1.	Low-interest and long-term loans from public banks with municipalities as guarantee were found to be highly favorable in Denmark and Germany. Those will support Dutch cooperatives to improve the business case and be realized. 
2.	Standardized heating contracts and cost-based pricing could overcome regulatory barriers, improve trust of consumers towards district heating and increase transparency in the heating sector. 
3.	Thermal energy cooperatives should lobby collectively at the national government to establish favoring regulations and increase legitimacy.  Workshops and lectures should be aimed at governmental organizations to increase awareness. 
4.	Municipalities should take cooperative district heating initiatives seriously and provide them with collaboration, support, and subsidies. 
5.	To increase professionality within thermal energy cooperatives, Energie Samen or other cooperative organizations can support on administrative, financial, and technical aspects. Such cooperative organizations could operate multiple cooperative district heating systems themselves."
Optimizing the Univentricular Heart: the Potentials of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell Therapy for patients with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome,"['Appels, Ymke']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-12-06T00:00:35Z,EN,['Mesenchymal stem cells; Hypoplastic left heart syndrome; therapy; pediatrics'],Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a congenital heart disease in which the left side of the heart is highly underdeveloped, hindering left-sided systemic circulation after birth. The condition is rare and accounts for only 9% of all congenital heart diseases but is fatal when left untreated. A three-stage univentricular palliative intervention, in which the right ventricle is tuned to sustain systemic circulation, has changed the prognosis of this condition. However, this univentricular circulation cannot be maintained indefinitely, as the right ventricle physiologically is not built to drive systemic circulation, which often leads to cardiovascular complications such as heart failure and, subsequently, complications such as arrhythmias. Potentially, (stem) cell-based therapies could enhance proper ventricular function to a state more suitable for systemic circulation. This review will discuss the potential therapeutic role of mesenchymal stromal cells in patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The morphological differences between the left and right ventricles are significant and must be considered when designing treatments for right ventricle dysfunction. Thus, the intrinsic differences between the two ventricles and the subsequent cellular mechanisms involved in this pathophysiological condition will be a topic of interest in the first part of this review. The paradigm of how mesenchymal stromal cells act in the injured myocardium has been shifted from a mechanism based on cellular engraftment and differentiation towards the cardiac lineage to one primarily based on the paracrine effect. Several preclinical studies will be discussed, including the different disease models for hypoplastic left heart syndrome that laid the groundwork for clinical application. Based on recent literature, we will shed light on the mesenchymal stromal cell secretome setting up cellular pathways that could cause the elucidated therapeutic effect, highlighting reducing reactive oxygen species (-mediated damages) in the myocardium involved in the right ventricular failure. The timing and route of administration are important factors in the effectiveness of therapy and will also be reviewed here. We will conclude with our view on these stem cell-based therapies' most effective application strategies. This review will thus provide an overview of the various ways mesenchymal stromal cells can be a valuable cell source for infants suffering from hypoplastic left heart syndrome to affect right ventricle dysfunction and improve longevity and quality of life."

This research is conducted in close collaboration with Stichting Studeren en Werken Op Maat which is an organisation that focuses on facilitating sustainable careers for Young Professionals with a distance to the labour market. In this process, the job coaching procedure they provide could be beneficial to attain this goal. The present study is therefore focused on the role of this job coaching procedure in achieving a sustainable career. Furthermore, it was investigated whether the person-job fit mediated this relationship. The data of this mixed-method study were collected by means of interviews and surveys which were analysed thoroughly. The results present that the person-job fit is not mediating the relationship between the job coaching procedure and career sustainability. However, it does play a significant role in achieving a sustainable career. Furthermore, regarding the quantitative results, the only relevant positive relationship is between the frequency of job coaching and work productivity. Contrarily, both the Young Professionals and the job coaches indicated they perceived the relationship between job coaching and the person- job fit to be positive. Next to that, an indirect relationship was identified with the indicators of career sustainability."
Effects of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation in the Theta Frequency on Associative Memory consolidation,"['Kop, Rosanne']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-12-02T00:00:34Z,EN,['Transcranial alternating current stimulation; theta-frequency; associative memory;\nconsolidation'],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Neural oscillations in the theta frequency range (4-8 Hz) are thought to underlie effective
communication between brain regions subserving associative memory (e.g., prefrontal-hippocampal
circuitry). Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation
technique that may entrain endogenous theta oscillations. Application of tACS during memory
encoding has been shown to modulate associative memory encoding; however, few studies have
investigated whether and how associative memory consolidation is affected by tACS at theta frequency
(i.e., theta-tACS). Using an interleaved EEG/tACS approach, we have evaluated electrophysiological
(i.e., frontal-midline theta power) and behavioral (i.e., memory task performance) effects of frontal
theta-tACS, applied during memory consolidation. In a counter-balanced cross-over design, 30
participants (50% F, mean age 24 years) received 20 minutes of either sham tACS or active tACS (5 Hz,
2 mA peak-to-peak) during the consolidation phase of an associative memory task. Results showed no
significant difference between stimulation conditions on our outcome measures. Our study provides
no evidence of an effect of frontal theta-tACS on associative memory performance or frontal-midline

Droogte in de Achterhoek | Een onderzoek naar de aanpak van een sluipende crisis met een focus op temporaliteit,"['Delden, Hannah van']","['Vis, Barbara']",2022-12-08T01:00:48Z,NL,['Sluipende crises; langetermijnbeleid; droogte; kwalitatieve casestudy'],Bestuur en beleid,"Crises worden gekenmerkt door dreiging, urgentie en onzekerheid. Ze kunnen voor komen in acute of in sluipende vorm. De sluipende crisis, waarbij de temporele factor anders ligt dan bij een acute crisis, wordt vaak minder urgent geacht, waardoor een treffende aanpak uitblijft. Over het treffend aanpakken van een sluipende crisis is relatief weinig bekend binnen de literatuur. Het is interessant om te onderzoeken of het creëren van langetermijnbeleid kan helpen bij de aanpak van een sluipende crisis, vanwege het vergelijkbare temporele aspect: gericht op een ruime tijdshorizon. Het ontwikkelen van langetermijnbeleid is geen gemakkelijke opgave, maar niet onmogelijk. Vier factoren die het ontwikkelen van dergelijk beleid bevorderen worden besproken in dit onderzoek: electorale zekerheid, zicht op winsten van het beleid, institutionele capaciteit en framing. Mogelijk kan er bij de aanpak van een sluipende crisis worden geleerd van de ontwikkeling van langetermijnbeleid. Dit vraagstuk staat centraal in dit onderzoek. Door middel van een kwalitatieve casestudy is gekeken in hoeverre inzichten over het creëren van langetermijnbeleid kunnen helpen bij de aanpak van een sluipende crisis. 
Deze vraag is onderzocht aan de hand van de casus ‘droogte in de Achterhoek’. Droogte in de Achterhoek kan worden beschouwd als een sluipende crisis. De aanpak krijgt vorm via een samenwerking tussen 19 partijen, bestaande uit onder andere provincie, gemeenten, waterschap en verschillende belangenorganisaties. 
Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat twee van de factoren die van invloed zijn op het creëren van langetermijnbeleid zeer relevant zijn (of minstens kunnen zijn) voor de aanpak van droogte in de Achterhoek: framing en capaciteit. Framing wordt niet bewust ingezet, maar er wordt bewust gewerkt aan beeldvorming en bepaalde woorden worden bewust gekozen of weggelaten. Bij capaciteit speelt in de Achterhoek voornamelijk het tekort aan goed personeel. De andere twee factoren bleken (op dit moment) minder relevant voor de Achterhoek. Electorale (on)zekerheid lijkt nog nauwelijks een rol te spelen omdat droogte (nog) niet gepolitiseerd is. De kans is echter groot dat het politieke karakter wel toeneemt de komende tijd, waardoor de factor ook relevant wordt. Vooruitzicht op winsten speelt in dit onderzoek een kleine rol, doordat binnen deze context de kans op winsten behoorlijk groot lijkt te zijn en de factor niet als een knelpunt wordt beleefd. De analyse van het onderwerp geeft wel aanleiding om te verwachten dat het onderwerp bij een andere sluipende crisis belemmerend kan werken.
Uit dit onderzoek komt ook naar voren dat bij de aanpak van deze sluipende crisis momentum een grote rol speelt en dat het inkleuren van toekomstbeelden kan helpen om droogte aan te pakken. Ook blijkt het nuttig om een lange termijnblik te gebruiken bij de aanpak van een sluipende crisis. Door te richten op een ruime tijdshorizon wordt de kans op een eenzijdige focus op de korte termijn verkleind. Inzichten over het creëren van langetermijnbeleid kunnen dus nuttig zijn voor de aanpak van een sluipende crisis: de aanpak van droogte in de Achterhoek."
The Association and Contribution of Gender-related Characteristics on Prevalent Chronic Kidney Disease in women and men in a multi-ethnic population,"['Vosters, Taryn']","['Kamphuis, Carlijn']",2022-12-08T10:00:38Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: Differences in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) between women and men have previously been reported. While biological explanation factors have been explored, research on sociocultural factors has been lacking. This paper investigates the influence that gender-related characteristics may have on the prevalence of CKD in women and men in a multi-ethnic population.
Research question: To what extent do gender-related characteristics contribute to CKD stage 1-5 and 3-5 in women and men aged 18-70 years in a multi-ethnic population. It will be investigated (1) which (if any) categories of gender-related characteristics are associated with the prevalence of CKD in women and men in a multi-ethnic population. And (2) to what extent do these gender-related characteristics contribute to the burden of prevalent CKD.
Methods: Cross-sectional analyses were performed on data from the Helius Study, across women and men and various ethnic groups. Poisson Regression was used to determine whether significant associations were present between CKD Outcomes (eGFR & ACR) and the gender-related variables 1) Time spent on Housework, 2) Primary Earner Status, 3) Employment Status, and 4) Occupational Segregation. Further Population Attributable Fractions were calculated to estimate the contribution of gender to prevalent CKD.
Results: Associations were found for CKD 1-5 and doing high amounts of housework in women, as well as all categories of employment status. In men, being unemployed showed a significant association in both CKD Outcomes. Being the primary earner proved significantly higher prevalence in women and men and CKD. Associations were mostly consistent across ethnic groups. Estimated contributions ranged between 13-54% and were attenuated by potential mediators.
Conclusion: The findings show that several gender-related characteristics are associated with CKD and that gender contributes to prevalent CKD in women and men in a multi-ethnic population. Further research should be conducted to determine target groups and develop precise interventions."
Greenhouse gas emission coverage and reduction potentials of scope 3 emissions in car manufacturing,"['Smeets, Jelle']","['Harmsen, Robert']",2022-12-08T01:00:52Z,EN,['Corporate climate action; car manufacturing; greenhouse gas emission coverage; scope 3 emissions; emission reduction potential; electric vehicles'],Sustainable Development,"In the car sector, total greenhouse gas emissions are dominated by indirect emission sources across 
complicated car supply chains. All indirect emissions fall under scope 3 of the GHG Protocol reporting 
standards and can be divided over upstream and downstream activities. Corporate reporting of these 
scope 3 emissions, however, is generally low, complicating possible estimations ofreduction potentials 
for this emission category. Therefore, this Master’s thesis assesses the current ambition of major car 
companies on reducing scope 3 emissions and the current state of their announced reduction targets. 
We investigated the current target landscape until mid-2022 and the total emission coverage of these 
targets in car supply chains. In addition, we conducted an in-depth analysis of upstream reduction 
strategies from the car companies’ sustainability reporting and calculated potential emission 
reductions based on electric vehicle (EV) targets in five of the leading global car markets until target 
year 2030. Quantification of reduction potentials from upstream steel and EV battery strategies was 
limited because of data availability and the lack of upstream targets from car companies. The low 
coverage of upstream scope 3 emissions further resulted in a maximum of 15% of potential uncovered 
emissions in car manufacturing. In contrast, downstream scope 3 emissions were covered more 
extensively through multiple reduction targets and the continuous updates of company EV sales 
targets. Under most recent EV targets, we found significantly higher targeted EV shares in comparison
to national policies defined under the Stated Policy Scenario (STEPS). Integrating increased EV uptake
in the calculation model resulted in reductions of 64, 77 and 90 Mt of CO2 for China, the US and the EU 
respectively, whereas Japan and India achieved low reductions of 3 and 1 MtCO2. In conclusion, more 
upstream reduction targets and overall transparency of supply chain innovations are required for an 
optimal coverage of scope 3 emissions and quantification of reduction potentials. Furthermore, we 
recommend better uptake of corporate EV targets in national policies to align with the rapid EV 
development. Although car companies showed limited upstream coverage, we argue that their 
downstream targets can provide an example of better national policies towards decarbonization of the 
car sector in this decade."
Transgender people of color: double injustice?,"['Umuhire, Sandrine']","['Bos, Jaap']",2022-12-08T10:00:35Z,EN,['transgender; transgender people of color (TPOC); white transgender people; race/ethnicity; gender identity; intersectionality; double injustice; America'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Introduction: Despite the number of laws that should minimize the disadvantages of transgender people in America, discrimination is still a problem among this group. Several studies show that transgender people in America experience more discrimination against their gender identity compared to cisgender people. Especially, transgender people of color (TPOC) face the highest level of discrimination compared to white American transgender people in every area of life. The aim of this study is to determine whether TPOC in America are structurally disadvantaged in areas of housing, employment, healthcare and police violence and therefore experience (double) injustice, because of their race/ethnicity and gender identity, compared to their white counterparts. An intersectional approach is used to examine the following research question: Do transgender people of color in America experience double injustice compared to their white counterparts and how does that impact their lives?
Methods: This research consists of a literature search and a quantitative study based on secondary data. The secondary data is an extensive survey of transgender discrimination based in the United States performed by the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) and the National LGBTQ Task Force (n=6456). A MANOVA analysis was used to compare the groups on multiple correlated dependent variables; employment, housing, healthcare and police violence, with race (white versus non-white transgender people) as independent variable. 
Results: TPOC face more discrimination than white transgender people in America in healthcare, employment and housing and are more at risk of experiencing police violence.
Conclusion: Results suggest more research is needed to continue examining the disparities in discrimination experienced by TPOC using an intersectional approach. With more research, understanding and acceptance there can be more prevention, education and outreach to TPOC."
A Closer Look at Parental Phubbing: Examining Different Contexts of Parental Phubbing on Adolescent’s Phone Use and the Potentially Moderating Effect of Age,"['Siemelink, Suzanne']","['Weinberg, D.W.']",2022-12-08T10:00:41Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"Introduction: Adolescents, and their parents, are heavy phone users. Excessive phone use is associated with a variety of mental health problems, and is thus a serious public health concern. Adolescent behaviors are partly learned in the home environment, so this study considers the role of parental phubbing behavior (parents who are using their phone during social interaction with their children) in adolescent phone use behavior.  The study considers three different phubbing contexts: phubbing during a conversation, during a meal or a during fun activity and examines the potential moderating role of the adolescent’s age.
Method:  This study used data from The Digital Family Project which studied adolescents aged 9-19 years old in Utrecht (n = 266). A correlation, regression and moderation analysis has been conducted for each phubbing context separately.
Results: The study shows that parental phubbing during a conversation has a small positive effect on adolescents’ mobile phone use, but no such effect for the other phubbing contexts. There was no moderation by age, such that the association between parental phubbing and phone use did not depend on adolescent age.
Discussion: These findings show that parental phubbing during a conversation correlated with slightly higher adolescent phone use. Further research could investigate the causal direction of this effect. The finding that age did not moderate this association should be interpreted in the light of the fact that this study took place during Covid times where adolescents were spending relatively more time with their family and less with their peers."
"Anti-cancer mechanisms of the most used drugs worldwide: old drugs, new insights","['Slobbe, Gijs van']","['Moret, Ed']",2022-12-09T01:01:05Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Despite recent therapeutical improvements, cancer remains the second leading cause of death. Therefore there is an emerging need for novel cancer treatments. Development of novel anti-cancer drugs to fulfill the need for novel treatments is expensive, takes a long time and goes along with a low change of gaining marketing authorization. An alternative cheaper and faster approach to fulfil the need of new anti-cancer drugs is drug repurposing. The worldwide most used drugs could be potential candidates for drug repurposing since their intensive use provides extensive safety data. Therefore, mechanisms that clarify anti-cancer activity of eight of the most used drugs worldwide and the drug classes where they belong to were investigated in this study. Literature review showed that the drug gabapentin and the drug classes statins, renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, selective betablockers (BBs), dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), biguanides and protein pump inhibitors (PPIs) showed potential anti-tumorigenic effects in vitro and in vivo. The anti-cancer effects were established by targeting of several cancer hallmarks including: sustaining proliferation, induction of invasion and metastasis, avoiding immune destruction, induction of angiogenesis, deregulation of cellular energetics, genome instability and resisting cell death. Beside the drug effects on cancer hallmarks, it was shown that some drugs induced the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition, the drug classes statins, RAS inhibitors, selective BBs, biguanides and PPIs showed combinational effects with conventional anti-cancer drugs, which increases the changes of successful drug repurposing since drugs have higher changes to get authorized as repurposed drugs if they will be combined. Overall, anti-cancer mechanisms were identified for all the investigated drugs. These mechanisms support suggested anti-cancer activity of the investigated drugs and therefore it was concluded that the drug gabapentin and the drug classes statins, RAS inhibitors, selective betablockers, dihydropyridine CCBs, biguanides and PPIs have the potential to be used for cancer drug repurposing. Since the drug classes statins, RAS inhibitors, selective BBs, biguanides and PPIs showed combinational effects with conventional treatments, these drug classes were especially considered as potential agents for cancer drug repurposing."
"Does Evidence-Based Medicine Serve Everyone? Representation, Reward and Risk In Phase I Clinical Trials","['Babcock, Ashton']","['Besamusca, Janna']",2022-12-09T01:01:00Z,EN,[],Social Policy and Public Health,"Evidence-based medicine is a vast industry created around supporting the testing of new
therapies before they are prescribed in the general population. Previous researchers have been
concerned with the representativeness of these trials, citing concerns of external validity for
female patients and racial minorities. However, Phase I trials, where the therapy is tested on a
small group of healthy volunteers, have not been studied as extensively. Recent work suggests this
group of participants may be disproportionately Black and Hispanic in the United States, reflecting
a phenomenon of serial participation. These participants are often unfairly disadvantaged in the
labor market, often facing unemployment, and are attracted to Phase I participation for the
payment. These findings have not been replicated with a systematic review, as the original
researchers relied on self report data, recruiting at trial centers themselves. This methodology is
prone to selection bias, as it relies on permission. The present study was a systematic review of
publicly available Phase I trials with the goal of clarifying factors which affect female enrollment as
well as determining if enrollment by race is affected by whether or not the participants receive
therapeutic benefit. A total of 300 articles reporting on 384 trials were included in this analysis. I

"Compounding Disasters, Disaster Vulnerability and Disaster Management: A Case Study of Breast Cancer Patients in Puerto Rico","['Mazur, Sophie Mazur']","['Bailey, Ajay']",2022-12-16T10:01:05Z,EN,"['Disaster Vulnerability; Puerto Rico (P.R.); Social Determinants of Health (SDH); Disaster Management (DM), Specialized Cancer Care; Health Inequity']",Sustainable Development,"BACKGROUND: Puerto Rico (P.R.) faces particular and exacerbated vulnerabilities from climate change-induced disasters. These types of disasters are increasing, becoming stronger and more destructive due to unnatural human activities. The increase in exposures, vulnerabilities, and health risks, leads to increased stress on health systems worldwide but disproportionately affects countries where health inequities exist. Most recently, Hurricane Maria, the earthquake sequence, and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the collapse of the healthcare system and the exacerbation of health inequities in P.R. Research shows that disaster management (DM) can help communities, families, and individuals prepare for disasters. However, current DM strategies are mainly focused on short-term health risks (such as immediate injuries and trauma, and acute infections), whereas the long-term impacts (e.g., risk of complications of specialized care and interruption of cancer treatment) remain overlooked. Disasters can significantly interrupt health services and lead to increased psychological distress, particularly in medically fragile populations. Women have been identified as more vulnerable to disasters; therefore, breast cancer patients face a “double jeopardy” to disaster risk due to their gender and illness. Therefore, this research will investigate DM from the Social Determinants of Health (SDH) perspective, two concepts often studied separately, giving a more comprehensive picture of the needs of vulnerable populations after disasters.

METHODS: A qualitative approach through media analysis, stakeholder interviews, and a case study focus group discussion was conducted to understand the relationship between health inequities and DM. It explored how current DM strategies in P.R. can create, and reinforce existing inequities, specifically for breast care patients after disasters.

RESULTS: The myopic and traditional perspective of DM is insufficient when health inequities exist, and therefore, there is an urgent need to broaden DM to incorporate the SDH perspective to mitigate health inequities. The results show that key barriers to DM implementation are (1) lack of preparedness, (2) top-down implementation, and (3) lack of data and transparency. Specifically for vulnerable populations, such as breast cancer patients, this results in inadequate access to healthcare, loss of electricity, and heightened psychological stress. Ultimately leading to lower survival rates and long-term adverse health outcomes.

CONCLUSION: The disasters exposed how current DM strategies are inadequate for mitigating long-term health outcomes. Therefore, a broader (bottom-up, inclusive, and community-level) perspective of DM prioritizing vulnerable populations and existing health inequities is imperative. Further research should be conducted to determine specific actions and recommendations for P.R. to facilitate this integration."

sought to determine which usability problems casual users face in Trifacta Wrangler
when executing three data structuring tasks that are required for report creation.
Furthermore, the aim was to identify how technical skill influences the usability
problems they face.
A usability test was conducted with 8 participants working in Sales, Marketing,

asked to fill in a survey inquiring about their technical skill and to fill in the System
Usability Scale rating their interaction. As a result of categorizing identified usability
problems according to the User Action Framework, it was found that most usability
problems belonged to the planning and translation phase of the interaction cycle.
Contrary to previous research, participants’ Excel skill influenced their capability
to plan interactions negatively. The System Usability Scale revealed that this might
be related to learnability as a usability criterium. In line with previous research,
one participant with prior SQL experience recovered from the most severe planning
issue due to their knowledge of programming concepts.
It can be said that to improve the self-service level of casual users, understanding
their planning of data structuring tasks is crucial. Further research is needed to verify
these findings by identifying tools and technologies used by a larger sample of casual

Impact of Climate Change on Summertime Air Quality in the Netherlands,"['Knauf, Johanna']","['Velders, Guus']",2022-12-16T10:00:49Z,EN,['Climate Change; Air Quality; Ozone; Nitrogen; Particulate Matter; Modelling; WRF; EMEP; HadGEM2-ES; Emissions'],Climate Physics,"Air quality depends both on the emission of air pollutants and on local meteorological conditions. Climate change could therefore affect air quality on local to global scales through changes in meteorology. This study aims to determine the regional impact of climate change on summertime air quality for the Netherlands and to compare it to the effect of air pollutant emission reductions. The focus is on changes in ozone, fine particulate
matter, and ammonia concentrations.

By nudging a weather model (WRF) with the output of a high climate change scenario (HadGEM2-ES RCP8.5), high resolution meteorology fields are obtained for a recent (2008-2017) and future (2050-2059) climate. It is shown that in this scenario climate change leads to a 2.5-fold increase in the number of stagnant days and to an increase in the daytime mixing layer height in the simulated summer period.

Simulations are performed with these two meteorological datasets and two emission datasets. The emissions are based on reported air pollutant emissions from 2008-2017 and on a maximum feasible reduction scenario for 2050 (ECLIPSE V6b MFR). Different combinations of the meteorology and emissions are then used as input for a nested chemical transport model (EMEP4NL). For a high future climate change scenario the simulations show an increase of 11% in the daily maximum 8-hour mean of ozone and a decrease of 6% in daily mean ammonia and of 25% in daily mean fine particulate matter concentrations in the Netherlands. Emission reduction measures alone lead to a decrease of 20% in ammonia and of 48% in fine particulate matter concentrations and to a shift in the ozone formation regime and local increases of ozone in urban areas. The combination of climate change and emission reduction measures reinforces the reductions in ammonia (-28%) and fine particulate matter (-59%) concentrations. For ozone, climate change has a detrimental effect on the benefit of emission reduction measures, but emission reduction measures half the mean effect of climate change on ozone concentrations in the Netherlands."

Regenerative medicine has the potential to create new therapies for USD using advanced organ-on-a-chip (OOC) models. Parameters must be optimized in OOC to create in-vivo-accurate models, and this study investigates the role of flow intermittent in culturing urethral cells with physiological phenotypes.
Methods: Porcine urethral epithelial cells (pUECs) and human buccal mucosa cells (hBMCs) were cultured, and one medium was optimized to support them both. The cells underwent flow experiments in which they were subject to constant, intermittent, or no shear stress. Some of these cells were fluorescently stained for zonula occludins-1 (ZO-1), as well as other markers, and imaged, while the others were processed for use in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. SEM images made from pig penile tissue were analyzed along with fluorescent cell images for alignment to flow and elongation. Statistical analysis was performed for comparison between different shear stress conditions.
Results: Intermittent flow led to significantly more elongated pUECs than those under constant flow or in tissue and significantly less aligned cells than in tissue. hBMCs were not quantified. 
Conclusions: Intermittent flow alone does not induce physiological morphology in pUECs. Functional metrics are needed before drawing further conclusions. Comparison to hBMCs should be done, and other parameters for recapitulating the native urethra should be considered for future iterations of the in-vitro urethra model."

mitigation of coastal erosion and protection against coastal disturbances and extreme weather events. 
These forests are however continuously under threat of degradation as the result of direct human actions

degradation and continue providing these ecosystems services, mangrove forests are able to expand or 
migrate. A major factor influencing their capacity to do this is their ability to influence sediment dynamics 
and consequently stimulate sedimentation. This review therefore aimed to show the ways in which 
mangroves facilitate this process. Here we start by describing the functional anatomy of mangroves for 
sediment trapping, together with the conditions necessary for mangrove forest migration. Once these 
theoretical foundations are established, we highlight a number of experimental studies, both in field and 
lab settings that have aimed to uncover the biophysical properties of mangroves that underlie sediment 
trapping, as well as remote sensing studies that describe the influence of sediment capture on mangrove 
forest migration in various geographical contexts. Subsequently, we describe how this experimental and 
remote sensing data has been used to create several models that are able to predict how mangrove 
ecosystems will develop under the influence of various bio-geomorphological factors. Next, we note some
Building with Nature projects that have intended to restore degraded mangrove forests by applying the 
acquired theoretical knowledge of sediment trapping. We then envision the future of mangrove forests,
where their survival is influenced by both environmental factors and human (in)actions. In summary, we 
note that comprehensive understanding of mangrove forests and the complexities regarding their 
context-dependence, in combination with sustainable usage are crucial in ensuring that these forests are

They are characterised by a highly acidic lumen which contains hydrolases. They are mainly responsible for the degradation of macromolecules and for providing cellular building blocks in times of stress using the autophagy or endolysosomal pathways. However, the function of lysosomes extends beyond its function in degradation, several novel functions have recently been ascribed to lysosomes. A lot of research in lysosome dynamics has been done in non-polarized cells. The dynamics of lysosomes is less established in polarized cells, such as neurons. Neurons are highly compartmentalized and pose spatially extended neuronal cytoplasm. The dependence of neurons on optimal lysosomal function is especially important since lysosome disfunction is linked to several neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we describe the roles played by lysosomes in neurons and how they maintain cellular homeostasis. We will focus on transport and regulation of lysosomes and how this is special for highly polarized cells. Furthermore, we discuss non-degradative functions of lysosomes in neurons. And finally, how lysosome disfunction contributes to neurodegenerative diseases."
Improving Rare Disease Diagnosis with BERT,"['Marcel Santoso, Marcel']","['Kenna, Kevin']",2022-10-26T00:00:54Z,EN,['rare diseases;bert;transformer;encoder;machine learning;diagnosis'],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"A rare disease is an illness that affects less than one in every 2,000 individuals. There are more than 6,000 recognized rare diseases in the European Union. Collectively, rare diseases affect thirty million people in the European Union. Many doctors do not have sufficient experience and knowledge to diagnose such a diverse and rare group of diseases. As a result, rare disease patients often wait for years before receiving a definite diagnosis. Electronic health records of diagnosed patients can guide the diagnosis process of current and future rare disease patients. However, extracting relevant clinical information from millions of EHRs is challenging, especially when most diagnosis information is recorded in unstructured texts. Different clinicians may use different terms to describe the same disease and symptoms. Additionally, contexts, such as negation and cues for familial history, may affect diagnosis interpretation. BERT is one of the current state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models that have been shown to understand linguistic contexts and perform NLP tasks well. This review aims to explore how BERT can improve rare disease diagnosis by processing clinical notes in EHRs. The ability of BERT to learn contextualized embeddings from data helps it to identify important words for rare disease diagnoses, such as symptoms and clinical signs, reliably. Additionally, BERT can also predict the most probable diagnosis given all information recorded in clinical notes. This information can help doctors restrict their diagnosis search space and expedite the diagnosis process of rare diseases. The use of contextualized embedding also allows BERT to be trained with imperfect labels in the fine-tuning phase. This skips the need to use labeled rare disease datasets for BERT fine-tuning process. BERT shows potential to be used in diagnosis support. However, class imbalance and limited training data for certain diseases must be sorted to improve BERT performance further."

Many are however
declining in size due to the impact of human activities in estuaries. One example of such an impact is a
change in the balance between sedimentation and erosion in the Oosterschelde due to the presence of a
storm surge barrier, which has led to ongoing erosion of the salt marshes in the Oosterschelde basin. In
this study a model that simulates salt marsh development was adapted to investigate whether and how
wave barriers could counter the erosion of salt marshes. For this, the model was expanded with a wave
model. Wave energy was found to interact with every aspect of marsh development ranging from
sedimentation to vegetation growth. An increasing cover of the marsh by wave barriers had a non-linear
effect in reducing wave impact leading to increased marsh development. This highlights that a partial
cover of the marsh by barriers provided sufficient wave protection, and increase heterogeneity of the
landscape and of biomass, which could optimize niche variability and hence biodiversity. Grazing of
marsh vegetation resulted in lower creek complexity. It is hypothesized that this is because vegetation
traps less sediment leading to increased topographic smoothing, reducing habitat heterogeneity. The
size of barriers could be of importance considering marsh restoration as a large coverage of the marsh
by barriers resulted in lower biodiversity and flow rate. This study highlights the potential of wave
barriers to prevent marsh erosion as well as manage habitat complexity, facilitating a diverse marsh

Methods: This study was cross-sectional in its design. Drug users (n=410) completed questionnaires based on Treatment Demand Indicator as defined by the EMCDDA, after requesting a service or entering an inpatient or outpatient treatment setting (n=11) in Luxembourg throughout the year 2019. The study sample was described with regard to their socio-demographic characteristics and drug consumption patterns using descriptive statistics. Subsequently, a two-step cluster analysis was conducted to identify drug users with different levels of harm exposure based on their drug consumption patterns. Thereafter, the relevance of the identified clusters was assessed regarding various predisposing, information and awareness socio-demographic factors using ANOVA and Chi-square analysis.
Results: The study revealed three groups who differed on their levels of harm exposure based on age at first illegal drug consumption, polysubstance use, mode of consumption, frequency of consumption and overdose. With regards to predisposing, awareness and information factors, the three groups differed significantly on age, judicial situation, professional situation, living situation and age at the end of education. A higher level of drug exposure was associated with a more precarious judicial situation and an earlier ending of schooling. 
Conclusions: The results of this study support the idea that groups of drug users with different levels of harm exposure exist. These differences in harm exposure should be taken into account to increase the effectiveness of proposed interventions. Moreover, the study reveals the significance of predisposing and awareness factors, as some socio-demographic characteristics act as protective factors including age, a more stable professional situation and living situation as these factors differed significantly among the three levels of harm exposure."

determine what resolution strategy will be adopted. A survey has been conducted in The 
Netherlands (N=775), including an experimental manipulation element regarding the green

Breast tumor detection, classification and treatment response monitoring currently rely on combinations of invasive biopsies and imaging procedures that use contrast agents, which increase the patient risks and discomfort. Diffusion MRI (dMRI), as a non-invasive and contrast agent-free imaging method, could be considered a viable alternative approach. Conventional dMRI methods already possess a role in breast cancer protocols, due to their contribution to the sensitivity and specificity of tumor diagnosis and assessment. This role however has remained purely a supplementary one, due to their low capability to resolve sub-voxel tissue heterogeneities that yield low specificity. Novel diffusion imaging techniques that claim microstructural imaging capabilities, could only recently be clinically investigated, after advancements in MRI software and hardware. By providing microstructural information and measuring biochemical properties on cellular scales, the hypothesized higher specificity of the obtained diffusion-based parameters could expand the clinical role of dMRI in breast cancer. This hypothesis is investigated in this review article, by presenting a compilation of findings from studies that report on breast tumor microstructure obtained by either conventional or microstructural dMRI methods. In an attempt to explore the feasibility of dMRI becoming a stand-alone breast cancer approach, the clinical value of the microstructural findings reported in each method is highlighted."

Levelling the playing field: The influence of municipal commissioning on care services in the social support act,"['Vandezande, David']","['Hoogenboom, Marcel']",2022-10-24T15:00:19Z,EN,"['Social support act, client satisfaction, care services']",Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: In 2015 the procurement of services in the social support act became the responsibility of the Dutch municipalities. New mechanisms were introduced, like client level competition and,  dialogue in the procurement. The influence of these mechanisms on the number and size of suppliers, contract duration, client satisfaction and how these are interrelated is researched. 
Methods: Quantitative data from all municipalities (n = 253) is used and data from ten specific municipalities (n= 10). First, the larger sample is analysed using quantitative methods followed by cluster analysis for the ten specific municipalities.
Results: The results show that client satisfaction increased between 2020 and 2017.
Next, dialogue-based procurement leads to longer contracts and higher client satisfaction and the number of suppliers has increased while their size has decreased. The cluster analysis indicates that this effect is strongest in smaller municipalities with shorter contract duration. In the larger municipalities, only the number of suppliers grew. 
Discussion: The results and literature show that a dialogue-based method leads to longer contracts and better quality of care. The client satisfaction increased between 2017 and 2020. This was unexpected but, larger municipalities had a higher score than smaller ones, which is in line with the literature. Finally, client level competition caused a large increase in the number of suppliers and a decrease in size which is also related to the size of the municipality and contract duration. Conclusions: If municipalities take the size of their municipality into account and work together with suppliers this leads to longer contract duration and higher client satisfaction.

Framework for integrating scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to reveal signatures and trajectories of immune cells,"['Schieler, Carlotta']","[""Kind, Jop's""]",2022-10-25T00:00:28Z,EN,['Integration; neural networks; multi-model; immunology; single cell'],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"Studying the dynamics and epigenetic signatures of immune cells is important to understand the differences in immune response of individuals. Vast amount of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data are available and computational tools exist to integrate these two data modalities. However, most computational tools are performing poorly when both measurements were done on parallel samples and lack keeping all the dynamics in the data after integration. Thus, to use the already existing data, we propose a framework designed for trajectory and comparison analysis. For integration we build on an already published neural network-based tool scDART and propose improvements in construction of the gene-activity matrix similar to MAESTRO to provide higher accuracy. In addition, we suggest implementation of further downstream analyses such as differential gene and accessibility analysis and gene set enrichment analysis specifically picked for immunological comparison studies."
The Moderating Role of General Multicultural Attitudes on the  Relation Between General Teaching Self-Efficacy and Attitudes  Toward Culturally Responsive Teaching,"['Post, Marieke']",[],2022-10-24T14:00:51Z,EN,['Culturally Responsive Teaching; teachers’ attitudes; self-efficacy; multicultural attitudes; culturally responsive attitude; shared  culture attitude; national culture attitude.'],Educational Sciences,"This explanatory quantitative survey research investigated to 
what extent teachers’ general multicultural attitudes reinforces

Krijnen et al. (2021) constructed a questionnaire, the Cultural 
Responsive Teaching Attitudes Scale, assessing three attitudes: 
cultural responsive ( = .78), shared culture ( = .82), and 
national culture ( = .82). A factor analysis explored the validity 
of the questionnaire. Teaching self-efficacy consists of student 
engagement, instructional strategies and classroom management 
and was measured by Ohio State Teacher Efficacy Scale ( = .88) 
(Tschannen-Moran & Hoy, 2001). Furthermore, teachers’ general 
multicultural attitudes are the teachers’ views toward cultural 
diversity and were measured by the Dutch Multicultural Ideology 
Scale ( = .68) (Arend-Thót & Van de Vijver, 2003). A 
moderation analysis was performed with the scores of primary 
school teachers excluding (N = 162) and including multivariate 
outliers (N = 168). The analysis (including outliers) had a 
significant interaction term for culturally responsive attitude and 
shared culture attitude. The analysis (excluding outliers) 
presented teachers with high self-efficacy did not need positive 
multicultural attitudes to have the culturally responsive attitude, 
while teachers with low self-efficacy needed high multicultural 
attitudes to have this attitude."

Organic proxies for the reconstruction of surface oceanographic conditions were used, notably organic-walled dinoflagellate cyst paleo-assemblages and biomarker proxy TEX86 for sea surface temperature reconstruction. This proxy-combination was applied on the sedimentary Core U1534 (IODP Expedition 382). The dinoflagellate cysts reflect a notable change from a S. antarctica- to N. labyrinthus-dominated assemblage, indicating a clear transition from glacial to interglacial conditions but with relative cold and dynamic waters related to the Subantarctic Front. However, the TEX86-based sea surface temperature reconstruction displays a mirrored trend to the general warming pattern of MIS 11, with a cooling trend (from ~13°C to 6-8°C) during the transition into MIS 11 and stable cool temperatures throughout most of the interglacial, but a sharp rise at the later stage of MIS 11 (ca. 30,000 years after the termination). A potential explanation is suggested by the enhanced transport of cold water via the Subantarctic Front into the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (commonly referred to as the cold water route). This appeared to subdue interglacial warming in the Falkland Region, until the cold water route weakened during the later stage of MIS 11, allowing a delayed warming of sea surface water in the region. 
The study helped to understand changes in the position and strength of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and provided an insight into the connectivity of cold, pacific-sourced subantarctic water via the Subantarctic Front into the Southern Atlantic Ocean during and towards a previous warm climate interval."
KPN’S LIAISON MANAGEMENT TEAM STRIVES FOR INNOVATION - How a small team of primarily interns is making an impact in a large company,"['Vries, Vincent de']","['Roelfsema, Hein']",2022-10-25T00:00:45Z,EN,['Innovation; KPN; Liaison; LMT; Business; Startups; Start-ups; Scaleups; Scale-ups; deals'],Science and Business Management,"“We love innovations, we love scale-ups”: Liaison Management Team.
KPN is market leader in the field of internet and telephony and have become so big by continuing to 
innovate the latest developments. Within the strategic plan of KPN they have included that they keep 
the focus on innovation through KPN ventures and the Liaison Management Team (LMT). Through 
partnerships with disruptive start-ups and scale-ups, KPN can stay ahead of the competition and 
continue to make an impact in a changing society. This report will shed insight how KPN and the LMT 
is functioning as a business, analyses what the biggest bottlenecks are regarding innovation, proposes 
and argues those solutions and gives some recommendations.
As an intern within the LMT, I am responsible for identifying opportunities to innovate, suggesting 
start-ups that could help with this, following up on the follow-up steps and ensuring that all involved 
stay up-to-date. To this end, the various departments, here referred to as hunting grounds (HGs), are 
divided among the various working interns within the LMT. Through collaboration with the business 
owner (BO), the person responsible for innovation within the HG, we arrive at possible connection 
points for the LMT during discussions. It is important for the survival of this team that the LMT 
continues to make an impact in the form of new innovations through collaborations with start-ups. 
Recently, the number of interns working has become somewhat fewer resulting in less impact being 
made. This report examines where the most gains can be made now that will allow the LMT to make 
even more impact. 
First of all, the problem was further explained by means of the five whys method. This led to 
hypotheses that were tested by means of a questionnaire to the BO’s we spoke to. In addition, a 
previously used questionnaire from last year was also used. Based on the results of both surveys, the 
problems were identified. From this, the following problems emerged that the LMT could benefit for 
when solved: First of all, the LMT needs to be seen more as a (real) part of KPN. Due to the image of 
the interns and not always providing the right connecting parties, not everyone takes the LMT 
seriously enough. This is also evident in that BO’s see the LMT primarily as fun inspiration and a way 
to have more time for other tasks. In the recommendation section some ideas and solutions are 
proposed that will result in a more professional team like consisting of more permanent employees. 
Secondly, the LMT needs to make sure that they know more about what is going on with the HG and 
BO and vice versa that the BO also knows how things are going at the LMT. For an intern it takes lots 
of time to get a feeling of how the business is really run. By having a list with all the platforms and 
products that are in place with additional information would definitely help the LMT in finding 
opportunities. Transparency is also an important part of innovation and is extensively explained."
Feasibility of cone beam computed tomography with invertible recurrent inference machines,"['Vrakidis, Konstantinos']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-10-25T00:00:52Z,EN,"['adaptive radiotherapy, cone beam computed tomography, image reconstruction, deep learning']",Medical Imaging,"Introduction: Online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) relies on high-quality in-room volumetric imaging. Conventional linear accelerators (linac) are generally equipped with onboard orthovoltage cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems. Due to their suboptimal image quality, however, their use is limited to patient positioning tasks. Deep learning-based methods can potentially generate synthetic-CTs (sCT) directly from CBCT projection data, and enable CBCT-based online ART to be brought to conventional treatment delivery systems. Designed for solving inverse problems, invertible recurrent inference machines (iRIM) can be considered a suitable candidate for this task. To this end, the feasibility of using iRIM frameworks for CBCT image reconstruction is examined in this work.

Materials & Methods: 2D and 3D iRIM models were implemented and trained on datasets composed of CBCTs from sixty-two head and neck patients who underwent head and neck image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT). In the 2D models, the CBCT inverse problem was approximated as a parallel-beam CT, while in their 3D counterparts, a CBCT geometry was emulated. In parallel, trainings using sparse CBCT data were performed on both 2D and 3D models by applying two-fold and four-fold reductions in acquisition angles. Utilizing the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) as a metric, the performances of the trained models were evaluated and subsequently compared using the paired Mann-Whitney U test.

Results: The 2D and 3D iRIMs respectively achieved SSIMs (mean ± std) of (0.96 ± 0.02) and (0.94 ± 0.04) in the case of the complete CBCT acquisitions. The two-fold and four-fold reduction in acquisition angles yielded (0.94 ± 0.04) and (0.93 ± 0.05) for the 2D iRIM, and (0.93 ± 0.05) and (0.92 ± 0.05) for the 3D iRIM, respectively. In all cases, the performances of the 2D iRIMs were superior to their corresponding 3D ones, with the differences not being found significant.

Conclusion: iRIMs can be used for CBCT reconstruction in 2D and 3D cases, even for undersampled acquisitions. This makes iRIM an excellent candidate to obtain high-quality CT-grade reconstructions from CBCT data, and potentially bring online ART to conventional clinical linacs."
Nonlinear tides and river flow of estuarine networks,"['Riet, Kris van der']","['Swart, H.E. de']",2022-10-28T00:00:56Z,EN,['tides; estuary; estuarine network; 2DV; tidal asymmetry; M4; analytical model; nonlinear; river flow; Rhine-Meuse'],Climate Physics,"Tides are important for the mixing and transport of sediments, salinity and nutrients in most
estuaries around the world. Therefore, a precise understanding of the tides in estuaries is
needed to predict changes over time. This research focuses on hydrodynamics and specifically
on the mechanisms that result in nonlinear tides in networks of interconnected channels, which
are known as estuarine networks.
To investigate this, a 2DV semi-analytical idealised model was developed that solves the
hydrodynamics in estuarine networks. Here, two different networks were examined. First,
the model was applied to an idealised three-channel network and subsequently the model was
extended to the Rhine-Meuse estuarine network in the current state. Next, two scenarios
are examined, studying the effect of respectively opening one of the Haringvliet sluices and
2-meters of sea-level rise on tides.
The results demonstrate that the model has been successfully applied to both networks.
A comparison with observations for the Rhine-Meuse network showed good agreement for
the linear tides (M2). A fair agreement was found for the nonlinear tides (M4). Here, the
divergence of excess mass due to Stokes drift and no-stress condition have been proven as the
most dominant mechanisms for the internal generation of nonlinear tides in this system. In
addition, the externally forced M4 tide was found to be a factor of 5-15 stronger than the
internally generated M4 tide.
Quantification of tidal asymmetry within the Rhine-Meuse has indicated that this system
exhibits particularly flood dominant behaviour for both the water level and current velocity.
Duration asymmetry showed strong flood dominance leading toward the middle part of the
estuary, followed by a decrease in the river part. Even stronger asymmetry was found
for the velocity asymmetry throughout almost the whole system. Mixed behaviour was found
for the flood-to-ebb ratio, with still predominantly flood dominant behaviour in most of the
channels. It was also discovered that velocity asymmetry increases with the depth of the
channels and the flood-to-ebb ratio decreases with depth. This emphasizes the importance of
a 2DV model.
Concerning the two scenarios, the opening of one of the Haringvliet sluices demonstrated
generally a slight increase in M2 and M4 elevation amplitudes and a combination of a slight
increase/decrease for the current amplitudes, depending on the position in the network. The
sea-level rise scenario revealed overall less impact on the tides than opening one of the Haringvliet sluices. Especially in the Haringvliet, an increase in M2 elevation amplitude was found
for this scenario. The M4 elevation amplitude increased particularly in the Nieuwe Maas. The
M2 current amplitude showed an overall minor increase in the network, whereas for the M4
current amplitude a combination of both minor increases/decreases was found."
A mutagenesis study of the antibiotic plectasin and the implications on its mode of action against MRSA,"['Weijde, Mick van der']","['Weingarth, M.H.']",2022-10-28T00:00:58Z,EN,['Plectasin; NMR; ITC; MIC; Mutagenesis'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"The threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is becoming a greater threat to the world’s healthcare. To combat AMR, there is a need to search and develop novel antibiotics. Plectasin is such novel antibiotic. It targets lipid II (LII), which is often referred to as the ‘Achilles heel’ of the cell. LII is an indispensable for the bacterium’s survival. It is the major building block for the bacterial peptidoglycan network and once disturbed, leads to rapid cell death. Plectasin is a cysteine-stabilized αβ defensin and a derivative of plectasin, NZ2114, is a triple mutant that has dramatically increased activity against methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus, one of the most dangerous drug-pathogen combinations. The three mutations (D9N, M13L, Q14R) in NZ2114 however do not overlap with the suggested LII binding site, and no rationale why these mutations increase the efficacy against MRSA could be found thus far.
Here, we investigated the effect of the three mutations on the efficacy of plectasin against MRSA, MSSA and Staphylococcus simulans using a combination of solution NMR, bacterial killing assays, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments. We found that mutations D9N and Q14R drastically increase plectasin’s activity against MRSA. The D9N mutation causes many chemical shift perturbations (CSP), specifically in the anionic patch and β-loop region that bind Ca2+ and W8 and F35 which are suggested to bind the sugars of LII. Mutations M13L and Q14R do not cause CSP in the Ca2+ binding site, but do cause CSP in the α-helix, which is responsible for oligomerization of plectasin."

contains the molecular structure, classification information and metabolites of compounds used in
human and animal medicinal, food, tobacco, and cosmetic products. Using GSRS, five sub-studies
were performed each investigating a pre-selected SA-ADR relationship. For four sub-studies, the SAADR relationship was described in former studies. For the fifth sub-study, a newly discovered
potential SA-ADR relationship was investigated. For each study, a GSRS search was performed, and it
was extracted if a specific drug-ADR combination was reported disproportionally in VigiLyze, the
global database for Individual Case Safety Reports of the WHO, and in addition the summary of
product characteristics (SmPC) was checked. 

First it was shown that the GSRS database could indeed be queried to find relevant structures
containing a number of pre-selected SAs. It was also shown that, based on a specific RM, GSRS
contained sufficient information to highlight drugs that formed similar RMs or contained parts of the
RM in their original structure. Thirdly, the possibilities of searching for drugs containing structural
varieties within one drug class were investigated and this showed the mediating effects of a
substituent on the occurrence of ADRs. This analysis showed the potential usability of the GSRS for
future PV research.
Additionally, it was demonstrated that GSRS could be used to find drugs with diverse therapeutic
indications containing a pre-selected SA. Looking at the SmPCs and reporting rate for the results,
2
signs of the involvement of this SA in the development of Steven-Johnson syndrome and
methemoglobinemia were displayed.
Finally, a possible relationship between a SA that was discovered by looking at the reason behind the
retraction of two fluoroquinolones and the ADR QT prolongation was described. The drugs
containing the SA showed, with one exception, a high reporting rate for QT prolongation, whereas
drugs that did not contain the SA did not.
Implications
This study shows that the GSRS database is a suitable tool for identifying drugs containing a SA. It
can help PV research by finding structurally related drugs in pre- and postmarketing stages."

The primary motivation for the researcher to start this research is to invalidate a common yet hazardous belief about the fundamental nature of this predicament - that the violence is simply a result of tribal or race tensions. At the same time, the research also aims to advance the current understanding of violent conflicts' dynamics in South Kivu. By delving into the activities of actors in alliances that produce communal violence against the Banyamulenge, the research aims to explore the realms where actors sustain violence that benefit self-serving interests and satisfy private agendas. Hence, the study applies alliance theory as a theoretical framework to explain inter-group and intra-group dynamics that have shaped the region's violent landscapes for the past few years. With primary and secondary evidence gathered through NGO reports, local news, and prior literature, this research seeks to analyze the actual situation and modify the theoretical framework critically. By the end of the study, this investigation reveals that the private agendas of armed actors and allies in South Kivu are essential to constituting the harsh reality in question and clarifying the logic of violence."

In surface sediments, SSTs based on Uk’37 are often 2–4°C colder than mean annual values, whereas SSTs based on TEX86 are generally 2–6°C warmer. Uk’37 is known to be prone to biases towards the production season of alkenones, a non-linear temperature response to temperatures >24°C and resuspension of alkenones when exported to the sea floor. TEX86, on the other hand, can be biased by the input of isoGDGTs produced by non-Thaumarchaeota or Thaumarchaeota living in the deep sea. This study assesses sources of bias in these proxies in the Mediterranean Sea by using sediment traps moored in the Bannock Basin at 500 m, 1500 m and 2500 m depth, collecting alkenones and isoGDGTs in a near-continuous time serie between 2008 and 2011. The data show that SST estimates based on Uk’37 underestimate mean annual values by 4°C in the upper trap and 6°C in the middle and lower trap. This colder bias is caused by the bias towards the production season of the alkenones, proved by the high alkenone fluxes in winter. SST estimates based on TEX86 overestimate mean annual values by 8-9°C at each sediment trap. This warmer bias is a result of isoGDGT contributions by Group I.1b Thaumarchaeota and deep-water dwelling Thaumarchaeota, proved by [Cren’]/([Cren] + [Cren’]) ratio values of >0.04 and the [GDGT-2]/[GDGT-3] ratio values of >5, respectively."

Person-centred care plays an equally important role in paediatric healthcare, particularly in potential additional communicative difficulties for paediatric patients to convey their wishes. Implementation of the questionnaire ‘’We would like to know you!’’ aims to support person-centred care for paediatric patients. This study investigates the user experience of the questionnaire and the extent to which it supports person-centred care from the perspective of the healthcare professional. 
Method: A retrospective interview content analysis was conducted, using a qualitative narrative research method. Healthcare professionals were interviewed according to a topic list. 
Results: Eleven healthcare professionals were interviewed, including doctors, nurses and educational workers. The questionnaire’s overall use indicated a low level of application, partly due to its’ early stage of implementation and the choice to approach only new patients. However, the majority of those utilizing the questionnaire found it practical in use, providing additional information in either getting to know their patient, facilitate contact or as a way of being alerted of children or topics in need of additional attention during consultation. 
Conclusion: Based on these findings, the questionnaire could contribute to supporting more person-centred care. However, when primarily approached as a tool to improve efficiency in healthcare, person-centred care could be diminished. Future research is recommended on a larger group of participants, further identifying the various ways the questionnaire is utilized to support its’ aim of more person-centred care."

I pose the research questions: How might queer and disabled networks and practices of care change the lived understanding of care in conditions of Western neoliberal capitalism? How can acts of care be acts of resistance? How does queer and disabled subjects’ exclusion from hegemonic chrononormativity challenge prevailing capitalist notions of linear progression and acceleration of time? How can care be re-thought and transformed by living in queer and crip temporalities? Answers to these questions are traced through in-depth conversations with queer and disabled people. My interlocutors’ experiences of care expose and are contingent on the utilization of care as a biopolitical technique of governance under conditions of Western neoliberal capitalism. Under these conditions, care needs and capacities of marginalized subjects are systemically and intimately disregarded and disavowed. This caring research inserts itself as a project that scrutinizes and enriches the current normative understanding of care by figuring it through and in its complex and reciprocal entanglements with multi-layered facets of disability and queerness. Non-normative care offers productive grounds for resistance against harmful chrononormative prescriptions of productivity and progress, hegemonic standards of normativity that debilitate marginalized subjects, and systemic and personal uncaringness. I analyze care in relation to theoretical discourses within critical disability studies (Freeman, 2007, 2010; Kafer, 2013, 2021; McRuer, 2006; Samuels, 2021) and queer studies (Keeling, 2019; Muñoz, 2009, Halberstam, 2005; Edelman, 2004) that criticize life and care under conditions of systemic and interpersonal violence and oppression, by grappling with concepts such as interdependence (Clare, 2017; Piepzna- Samarasinha, 2018), debility (Shildrick, 2015), kinship (Hill Collins, 1995; Weston, 1997), resilience (Bracke, 2016; Butler, 2016) and resistance (Ahmed, 2014).

Affective Language Processing: Language-driven Evaluation of Character Affect in Morally Loaded Narratives,"['Kloostra, Li']","['Berkum, Jos van']",2022-12-08T00:00:38Z,EN,['affect; embodiment; emotion; facial electromyography; morality; psycholinguistics'],Linguistics,"Research has shown that the valence of emotional linguistic stimuli is reflected in corrugator supercilii
(‘frowning muscle’) activation, which can be measured using facial electromyography. But in a larger
context, the corrugator response may be additionally affected by emotional evaluation, i.e., how we
feel about some emotion. An earlier study from 2019 found that descriptions of moral characters
experiencing negative emotions elicited substantially more corrugator activity than positive emotions,
thus reflecting valence, but they found no effect of valence for adjectives describing immoral
characters. The authors therefore suggested that both mental simulation of word valence and moral
evaluation may drive corrugator activation, e.g., mentally simulating ‘angry’ activates the corrugator
and ‘happy’ relaxes it, whereas evaluation may elicit relaxation for both moral-positive and
immoral-negative stories. This is based on the idea that good people deserve good things and bad people
deserve bad things. More research was needed to corroborate the existence of these two effects
opposing each other. This current study therefore used the same narratives but with an additional
task that requested participants to explicitly judge the behavior with a rating task. This was
hypothesized to increase their tendency to evaluate what they read and subsequently change the net
result that the postulated two effects should have. Critically, we expected more frowning for bad
people experiencing positive emotions than negative emotions since bad people feeling good should
be seen as very unfair. However, this is not what we found, and our study in fact replicated the findings
from 2019: a null result of valence for adjectives describing immoral characters and a large valence-based effect for adjectives describing moral characters. Surprisingly, we did find the expected
evaluation-based pattern in responses on an exploratory task where we asked participants to rate the
fairness of every narratives’ ending. Finally, we found preliminary evidence that a person’s attitude
towards justice, i.e., their preference or desire for morally good people being rewarded and morally
bad people being punished, as a personality trait may modulate the effect that morality and valence
have on their corrugator responses."

Vision transformers are a top-performing architecture in computer vision, with little research on their use for pain assessment. In this thesis, we propose the first fully-attentive automated pain assessment pipeline that achieves state-of-the-art performance on direct and indirect pain detection from facial expressions. The models are trained on the UNBC-McMaster dataset, after faces are 3D-registered and rotated to the canonical frontal view. In our direct pain detection experiments we identify important areas of the hyperparameter space and their interaction with vision and video vision transformers, obtaining three noteworthy models. We also test these models on indirect pain detection and direct and indirect pain intensity estimation. Our indirect pain detection models underperform compared to their direct counterparts, but still outperform previous works while providing explanations for their predictions. We analyze the attention maps of one of our direct pain detection models, finding reasonable interpretations for its predictions. We find the models to perform much worse on pain intensity estimation, showing the limits of the simple approach chosen. We also evaluate Mixup, an augmentation technique, and Sharpness-Aware Minimization, an optimizer, with no success. Our presented models for direct pain detection, ViT-1-D (F1 score 0.55 ± 0.15), ViViT-1-D (F1 score 0.55 ± 0.13), and ViViT-2-D (F1 score 0.49 ± 0.04), all outperform earlier works, showing the potential of vision transformers for pain detection."

To include robustness into the objective of a local search approach, an efficient way to quantify the robustness of a solution is required. Since exact computation of the robustness of a schedule is complex and simulation is computationally expensive, the need for surrogate robustness measures arises. Therefore, we evaluated several existing and new proposed robustness measures on their ability to estimate the true robustness, with the aim of creating stable baseline schedules bounded by a deadline. We compared the estimates of the robustness measures with the results of a Monte Carlo simulation by reporting their Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients for various notions of robustness and several processing time probability distributions. Furthermore, we implemented a local search algorithm which uses the robustness measures to evaluate the quality of the schedule. We showed the effectiveness of robustness measures as indicators of true robustness and their practical application in generating stable baseline schedules."

Decentral routing strategies for public transportation,"['Waardenburg, Lisanne']","['Akker, Marjan van den']",2022-12-07T01:01:16Z,EN,[],Computing Science,"In case of large disturbances in public transportation networks, there often is little information available for central dispatching. Moreover, high frequency systems may use decentral dispatching. We consider a local dispatching strategy, where a cyclic order is assigned to the lines. This order determines which route the next vehicle to depart will take and the timetable determines when this will be.
It has been proved this system stabilises to the normal schedule, when all lines are operated with the same frequency. When looking at arbitrary frequencies, deciding whether a timetable can be operated with a certain number of vehicles is NP-complete in the strong sense.
The goal of this thesis is to consider variations, e.g. star networks or frequencies that are multiples of each other and see if these are NP-complete as well or if we can prove stabilisation results. In case of stabilisation we would also like to know how fast it stabilises. Finally we will consider the stabilised situation to see if we can deduce properties for the stabilised system."

equine housing systems","['Eicher, Puck']","['Elte, Yteke']",2022-12-15T01:00:53Z,EN,['paard; paarden; welzijn; gedrag; housing; horses; welfare; animal behaviour; huisvesting; diergeneeskunde; ecologie; ecology; behavior; ethological needs.'],Environmental Biology,"Abstract 
The present literature review provides an overview of welfare improvement possibilities for
individually and group housed horses. The three most important equine ethological needs are used to
identify why and how housing can be adjusted to be more fitting to a horses’ nature. These three needs
find their origin in the horse’s evolutionary history, and they comprise of foraging, locomotion and
social contact. Individualstable box housing remainsthe most used housing system today even though
this type of housing is considered unsuitable for horses. Group housing on the other hand has less
drawbacks than solitary housing. To remedy equine welfare in individual housing, several adjustments
to the husbandry and environment are suggested. Welfare improvement possibilities were identified
by performing a structured literature review. Environmental enrichment trough the addition of toys in
the stable environment only has a limited effect on equine welfare. Providing several types of high 
quality, low energy roughage forage of a suitable amount has more potential in aiding a horse in 
fulfilling the need to forage. To help a horse fulfil the need for locomotion, daily free exercise and daily 
forced exercise are recommended. However, more research is needed how much locomotion is 
minimally needed to truly fulfil this need. The same goes for social contact. It is not known how much 
social contact is needed minimally for a horse to reach a state of good welfare. Placing grill bars, mirrors 
and providing sightlines to other horses are proposed to enable a horse to have more social contact. 
Opening a window in the stable wall on the other hand is not in the interest of improving equine 
welfare. Musical enrichment, although not fitting to one of the above-named ethological needs, also 
shows promising effects on equine welfare. However, more research into this type of enrichment is 
necessary. 

Layman summary 
Welzijn van dieren die wij als mens houden is in de laatste jaren steeds een belangrijker punt van 
discussie in de maatschappij en de wetenschap. Deze literatuurstudie focust op het identificeren van 
mogelijkheden om welzijn van paarden die gehuisvest zijn in individuele stallen of in groepsverband te 
verbeteren. Paarden zijn in de loop van de evolutie aangepast aan een leven in een sociale groep, 
levend van voedsel met een laag energie- en hoog vezelgehalte. Afhankelijk van de kwaliteit van het 
voedsel leggen wilde paarden grote afstanden af om aan voldoende energie te komen.
Gedomesticeerde paarden hebben nog steeds dezelfde behoeftes als wilde paarden. Daarom zijn de 
belangrijkste natuurlijke behoeften van het gedomesticeerde paard: sociaal contact, bewegen, en 
ruwvoer zoeken/eten. Individuele huisvesting van paarden kan beperkend zijn op deze 3 vlakken. 
Groepshuisvesting heeft meer potentie om te voldoen aan de 3 behoeften, alhoewel het verschilt per 
groepshuisvesting of er ook daadwerkelijk aan wordt voldaan. Verrijking in de vorm het plaatsen van 
speelgoed en objecten in stallen heeft maar een beperkt effect op het welzijn van paarden. Het voeren 
van een goede kwaliteit en gepaste kwantiteit ruwvoer aan de andere kant, heeft meer potentie om 
een paard te helpen om in zijn behoefte van ruwvoer te voorzien en zo welzijn te verbeteren. De beste 
methode om een paard dit aan te bieden is via een slow-feeder. Wanneer een paard geen of niet 
genoeg ruwvoer mag eten is de tweede beste optie het aanbieden van een speelgoed object met een 
eetbare factor. Met het type vloerbedekking in stallen kan ook welzijnswinst behaald worden. Stro is 
het geschiktst gebleken om paarden te helpen in hun behoefte te voorzien. Om paarden genoeg te 
laten bewegen is het aan te raden om een paard dat op stal staat elke dag vrij en gedwongen te laten 
bewegen. Het is echter nog niet bekend hoeveel beweging nou echt minimaal nod"
The role of germline heterozygous LZTR1 variants in pediatric cancer predisposition,"['Bosse, Djoeke van den']","['Kuiper, Roland']",2022-12-15T01:01:02Z,EN,[],"Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology","Cancer is caused by various mutations in the DNA which can occur spontaneously during life, called somatic mutations, or which can already be present in the DNA at birth, called germline mutations. The presence of germline mutations which can cause cancer means that someone has a predisposition to cancer. We can identify whether patients have a cancer predisposition by sequencing the DNA of their healthy cells. In this sequencing data we can look for mutations in well-known cancer predisposition genes, but sometimes interesting mutations appear in genes for which we do not yet know if they result in cancer predisposition. An example of such unknown mutations are mutations in the leucine zipper-like transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1) gene. We have recently identified multiple different mutations in LZTR1 in the germline of children with different types of cancer. We see these germline mutations more often in children with cancer than in healthy people. It is not yet known whether these germline LZTR1 mutations can result in cancer development in children, and thus whether it is a cancer predisposition gene in children. To investigate this, we have created cell lines where the LZTR1 protein is absent, to mimic the presence of a germline LZTR1 mutation in a patient, as well as cell lines where the LZTR1 protein is still present. We performed RNA sequencing on these cell lines and compared the results with each other, to see what the effect of the removal of LZTR1 is on the gene expression. We looked at individual genes as well as whole signaling pathways to see which genes and pathways are higher or lower expressed when LZTR1 is absent, and whether we can link these genes and pathways to cancer development. Thus far, we cannot draw any conclusion from this analysis because the sample size is too small to determine significant changes in gene expression. Besides the cell lines, we have also collected data from children with cancer and a germline mutation in LZTR1. We compared this patient data to a cohort of patients with the same tumor type but without the germline LZTR1 mutation, to see which genes and pathways are higher or lower expressed in the tumors due to the LZTR1 mutation. We have performed this comparison for one tumor sample, which is, again, too small to get significant results from the analysis. Lastly, we wanted to compare the results from the cell lines to the results from the patient data. The aim was to look at the genes that are higher or lower expressed in the cell lines without the LZTR1 protein and see if these specific genes have also changed expression in the tumor samples of the patients. To perform this comparison in the future it is necessary to identify more cell clones with and without the LZTR1 protein and perform RNA sequencing on them, to be able to draw conclusions on significant changes in gene expression caused by the absence of LZTR1."
Antimicrobial Resistance: Is It A One Health Issue?,"['Kardomatea, Nafsika']","['Willems, R.J.L.']",2022-12-15T01:01:04Z,EN,[],One Health,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) constitutes a serious threat to public health by rendering bacteria, previously susceptible to antimicrobials, resistant to their effects. Recent reports indicate that a considerable amount of human deaths is associated or even directly attributable to antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections. Bacteria can become resistant because of spontaneous mutations or horizontal acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) from exogenous sources. Horizontal transfer of ARGs can occur via mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids, transposons or bacteriophages and this way, interspecies dissemination of ARGs can occur. Use of antimicrobials constitutes a well-described driver of AMR because it applies selection pressure on bacteria. Importantly, high amounts of antimicrobials are being used in livestock, which has caused concern on potential inter-host zoonotic transmission of AMR strains or ARGs. However, there are scarce evidence indicating transmission of AMR can happen between humans and animals, especially using robust methodologies. In this review, 19 papers employing whole-genome sequencing are presented on the basis of providing robust evidence (or not) of inter-host AMR transmission. In high-income countries (HICs), no or very limited evidence were identified. Comparably, more studies reported such events in upper-middle income countries (UMICs) and lower-middle income countries (LMICs), possibly because of a higher use of antimicrobials and closer contacts between humans and animals. Horizontal transfer of ARGs via MGEs appeared to play an important role in these events. Future studies should follow longitudinal, systematic sampling across both sectors to shed more light into the frequency and speed of this occurrence globally."
Consistent interpretation of air pollution related OMICs data; A case study in environmental epidemiological research,"['Boven, Bjorn van']","['Portengen, Lützen']",2022-12-15T01:00:50Z,EN,['Euretos; Artificial Intelligence; Air pollution; OMICs data; Environmental Epidemiology'],Toxicology and Environmental Health,"Environmental epidemiological research is conducted to study the different factors that cause (the distribution of) diseases within the population and is performed worldwide. Wherein the exposure to different types of air pollution is a global concern. In most cases, performing epidemiological research results in sets of genes or so called biomarkers, special molecules which can indicate or predict specific health outcomes. In environmental epidemiology these signals (genes or biomarkers) are mild and complex to get hard evidence. While performing research, researchers are looking for conformation of their data; does my data match the results from other researchers? However, like a  farmer, who would be expected to select only the ripest and healthiest fruits. Causing an observer who sees only the selected fruit may thus wrongly conclude that most, or even all, of the tree's fruit is in a likewise good condition. The same could, and probably should not, happen in research. By ‘cherry picking’ the results that confirm your obtained data, could lead to conformation biases and give a misrepresentation of reality. Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven tools could provide a powerful tool in this type of data rectification.  These artificial intelligence programmes can examine, observe and predict possible relations between experimental derived data. In epidemiology a variety of AI tools are implemented in different types of research. However for this study we used an AI tool which is already implemented for pharmaceutical research. The Euretos Knowledge Platform (EKP) is used in cancer research and other disease and drug research. In the pharmaceutical research field, the programme has been recognized on one of the leading companies and used by world leading pharma, biotech and academic institutions such as AstraZenica and Johnsen & Johnsen (Janssen). The main objective of this study was to see if the EKP can improve the environmental epidemiological research and provide us with new insights in this field of biology. 
We used the EKP to look into relations between the exposure of air pollution, the effected genes and relations to different health outcomes. We defined the genes associated to different types of air pollution (e.g. ozone, nitrogen oxides particulate matter (fine or ultrafine particles)) combined with the 5 different health outcomes (Asthma, COPD, Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, acute myocardial infarction and CVA). For this study we used the EKP to organize relation maps, to give a better representation of the relations between the different genes. Figures, like Fig. 3, help us to give insights on the different relations. 
In the end, the programme showed different relations between the air polluted related genes and the different health outcomes. Next to this, the EKP could perform useful pathway analysis. An type of analysis that helps researchers gain insight into gene lists. This method identifies biological pathways that are enriched in a gene list more than would be expected by chance. However, the programme was programmed to work for drugs and disease research. A scientific field in which more information is available. The lack of curated (organized) epidemiological data, limited the programme to work optimal. More available data and some minimal changes could make the EKP feasible for widespread use in different fields of research."
Liposomal encapsulation of levodopa to improve current Parkinson's disease treatment,"['Knol, Maarten']","['Caiazzo, Massimiliano']",2022-12-15T01:00:59Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease known. PD is characterised by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) due to the formation of Lewy Bodies (LB). LB disturb essential cellular pathways and induce neural cell death, resulting in dopamine (DA) deficiencies which manifests itself in (non-)motor symptoms including tremors, rigidity and loss of smell. At the time of writing, no treatment exist that cures or slows down the progressivity of PD. Current treatments aim at the delivery of L-3,4-dihydrophenylalanine (L-DOPA), a DA precursor, to the brain. L-DOPA is generally taken orally as this is convenient for patients, but is poorly taken up systemically, resulting in inefficient drug delivery. Moreover, rapid enzymatic and oxidative conversion of L-DOPA systemically cause a low half-life (50 minutes), leading to the need of high and frequent drug intake. As PD progresses, the SNpc lose the ability to store L-DOPA which further increases the need of excessive L-DOPA intake. As 1% of the administered L-DOPA reaches the brain, the majority is present systemically resulting in severe side effects including dyskinesia.
To improve current treatments, L-DOPA is encapsulated in liposomes to protect against rapid degradation, lead to sustained drug release, lower the systemic concentration and result in increased (indirect) targeting. The preparation, characterisation and L-DOPA loading of the liposomes have been formulated by previous students. This report continues on the project by demonstrating the L-DOPA retention kinetics in liposomes in relevant biological media to mimic in vivo. These retention studies have been performed with an innovative method, based on the biotin and streptavidin interaction.
The retention kinetics in blood plasma demonstrated the presence of a burst release in the first 2h of incubation in which close to 40% of the original content is released. Incubation of ≥6h revealed a discontinuation in drug release. Retention study in HEPES buffered saline (HBS) (pH 6.5) revealed a smaller burst release of 27% in the first 2h, followed by a 1%/h drug release, indicating the cruciality of blood components on liposomal drug release. Unfortunately, the retention studies performed in whole blood were unconclusive as molecules closely resembled L-DOPA were present in measured samples, making the quantification of solely L-DOPA unattainable. Moreover, the results concluded that applying HBS or dialyse cassettes for retention studies can be used to create an initial indication, but no in vivo retention kinetics can be derived due to the lack of protein corona formulation.
In conclusion, the liposomal encapsulation of L-DOPA is promising for future treatments as pharmacological properties including half-life and sustained drug release are improved. Moreover, the use of the biotin-streptavidin method has shown to be advantageous in predicting the drug retention kinetics in vivo. Yet additional research is needed to improve the method."

So far, studies examining the relationship between hypertension and HIV and ART status are cross-sectional and lack longitudinal associations.
METHODS: A longitudinal analysis was performed on data from the Ndlovu Cohort Study, South Africa, comparing data from HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals collected annually across a 3-year follow-up period. Linear mixed models were used to estimate trends in systolic and diastolic blood pressure by sex over time according to HIV and ART status. RESULTS: Data was analysed from 1364 participants with a median age of 39 years (SD ± 12.8); 557 (40.8%) were HIV-positive and 764 (56%) were female. A total of 432 HIV-infected individuals were taking ART medication, of whom 78.8% measured an undetectable viral load of <50 cp/mL. The baseline hypertension prevalence (≥140/≥90 mmHg ) was 20.4% in HIV-negative participants and 10.2% in HIV-positive participants on ART, which increased to 38.7% and 26.6% respectively after 36-months of follow-up. After multivariable adjustment, use of ART medication, but not HIV status, was associated with an 8.41 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure [P=≤0.001]. Sex-stratified analysis showed classic CVD risk factors were a specific concern for HIV-positive males.
CONCLUSIONS: South Africa is faced with a high overall burden of uncontrolled hypertension. There is a need for population-level prevention of factors associated with hypertension and CVD risk, with emphasis on improving health-seeking behaviours in men."

current societal issues, but most of them fail to reach the market due to lack of investments.
While it is widely known that start- and scale-ups are in need of financial resources, the influence
of different financing methods (venture-, corporate- and angel investors) on the potential success,
is not identified so far. This research investigates the used type of financing method and
compares it to the success of start- and scale-ups. For the theoretical framework, the resourcebased view and the VRIN-model are used to develop an instrument to assess the success of a
company.

Method: using the Techleap database, 360 start- and scale-ups were assessed. These start- and
scale-ups all received funding and provided enough information. A start- and scale-up
assessment method was created to generate a success score, that includes the resource-based
view and the VRIN-model. After splitting the data into two datasets (one including startups, the
other one including scale-ups), a logistic regression was performed. Besides this, three different
robustness tests were performed.

Results: the findings show that corporate capital or the combination of corporate- and angel
investors have a negative effect on the success of startups, compared to the use of merely venture
capital. For scale-ups, the use of all three finance methods have a positive effect on the success
of the business, compared to using only venture capital. However, the impact on the corporate
success is considerably small. Besides the finance methods, the amount of employees working
at the organization shows to have positive impact on the success of the business. Considering
some additional control variables. startups profit mainly from sustainability, a CSR policy and a
commercialized product, while participation in a contest and the CSR policy is positively related
for scale-ups.

Discussion/Conclusion: while there is some relation between some of the finance methods and
the success of the start- or scale-up, the impact is considerably small. The (additional) control
variables have a positive relation to the success score as well. There are two main contributions
of this research. First, it develops the start- and scale-up assessment method, which can be used
by investors to estimate the expected success of an organization. Second, while there is already

important for paleoclimate reconstructions. The distribution and ages of landforms in the modern landscape
can provide understanding of patterns and processes of glaciation during the past. This study contributes to
an enhanced understanding of Svalbard’s deglaciation by investigating Synndalen, a deglaciated valley on
Svalbard with two well constrained ice-marginal landforms. Here, the Late Glacial and Holocene deglacial
history of Synndalen are reconstructed based on its geomorphological evolution. A detailed geomorphological
map is presented based on in-field and remote geomorphological mapping and a spatiotemporal framework of
glacial events is constructed based on absolute and relative dating methods. Radiocarbon ages of three marine
bivalve molluscs are presented, ranging between 10251 and 10532 14C yrs BP, and have been calibrated to
11.3-11.7 cal. ka BP. These ages provide a minimum age constrain for the deglaciation of the Synndalen
valley-mouth.
This study shows that Synndalen’s deglaciation has been interrupted by two readvances. A minor retreat and
advance cycle at the valley-mouth resulted in the formation of an end moraine and is considered to have
been mainly dynamically driven. Very approximate age constraints constrain this advance to the Younger
Dryas interstadial, although the importance of further research is emphasized. A readvance at the valleyhead formed another moraine and adds to the increasing number of identified Early Holocene readvances on
Svalbard.
As the climate on Svalbard during the Early Holocene was warmer than at present, reconstructions of cryospheric responses can serve as a potential analogue for future climate warming."
Effect of the Covid-19 Pandemic on the Drinking Behaviour of Dutch Adolescents with Different Socioeconomic Backgrounds,"['Maurer, Josephin']","['Weinberg, D.W.']",2022-12-22T00:00:34Z,EN,['adolescents; socioeconomic position; drinking behaviour; Covid-19 pandemic'],Social Policy and Public Health,"Background: Alcohol use among adolescents is a global health concern, which is associated with a higher prevalence of alcohol dependence later in life and can affect development. However, different socioeconomic groups seem unequally affected by alcohol consumption, with lower socioeconomic groups experiencing more significant harm from alcohol consumption. With the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, these differences have the potential to be aggravated even further. The current study examined the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic on the drinking behaviour of adolescents in different socioeconomic groups in the Netherlands. 
Method: Longitudinal survey data from the Youth Got Talent study was used. Participants (N=1650) were 16 years or older and attended vocational schools in the Netherlands. Logistic regression analyses assessed associations between socioeconomic position and drinking behaviour (binge drinking and drinking frequency) before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. ANOVA analyses were performed to assess the change in drinking behaviour for socioeconomic groups before and during the pandemic. Results: Drinking frequency increased for all adolescents in this sample during the pandemic, while binge drinking decreased. However, no significant relations were found between socioeconomic position and drinking behaviour. There was also no significant change in drinking behaviour pre-and during the pandemic between socioeconomic groups. 
Conclusion: There was no evidence that socioeconomic position influenced adolescents’ drinking behaviour pre-or during the pandemic in this sample. Unequal sample sizes for socioeconomic groups may have affected these results. Therefore, future research is needed that uses equal sample sizes to investigate factors that influence alcohol consumption in adolescents, especially during social isolation. This would help improve policies and interventions that target alcohol consumption in adolescents in the Netherlands."
A Road of One's Own: On the Roles of Mobilities in Feminist Utopian Writings,"['Dries, Iona van den']","['Bagchi, Barnita']",2022-12-17T01:00:56Z,EN,['utopia; utopianism; mobilities; feminist utopia; comparative literature; feminist utopian writings; women writers'],Comparative Literary Studies,"A key to utopia’s relevance and fascination lies in its dual function as critique of society and hopeful imagining of alternatives, as well as the question of how one might reach an unreachable ideal. From this starting point, my thesis combines insights and concepts from utopian, feminist, and mobilities studies with approaches from comparative literature to investigate the role(s) of mobilities in feminist utopian writings. My case studies include the short story “Sultana’s Dream” (1905) and novella Padmarag (1924) by Bengali author Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880-1932) and the novel Iola Leroy (1893) and two speeches, “We Are All Bound Up Together” (1866) and “Woman’s Political Future” (1893), by American author Frances Ellen Watkins Harper (1825-1911). By combining flexible definitions of utopia and utopianism with an intersectional, comparative view on feminism, and distinguishing various types of mobility and their relations, I discuss how Hossain and Harper each present mobilities as sites of oppression and liberation. I argue that mobilities play a vital role in their social dreaming and that mobilities serve as a productive factor for cross-cultural comparison. Feminist utopian writings allow their authors and readers to look beyond (im)possibilities in reality to envision social change. A revaluation of mobilities in these narratives—both in realistic and more utopian spaces—helps distinguish consequences of intersectional oppressions and reimagine them as sites for potential social change. Finally, the writings of Hossain and Harper play an essential role among their other practical utopian projects to communicate social critique and dreams of a better society to readers and thinkers across time and space, broadening perspectives on what is (im)possible."

Despite strict biosecurity measures, farms keep getting infected. Airborne transmission at the wild-domestic interface and between farms is one the routes that is thought to play a role in these introductions. Poultry farms emit large amounts of particulate matter (PM) into the environment that can serve as vectors for (HP)AIV (RNA). Moreover, airborne spread may impose a risk for public health, as some variants of the virus are zoonotic. Current risk assessment models predict risks based on particles with standard aerodynamic diameters, but behaviour of feather (material) and other organic material, and the viability of HPAIV associated with different particles is largely unknown. The aim of this project is to gain insight into the behaviour of and distribution of infectious virus over different particle types and to improve risk assessment models for airborne transmission. Model input parameters will be collected from the literature, laboratory, and field experiments. Current mathematical models will be adapted, parameterized with the collected data, and validated. This model will serve as a tool for policymakers and will allow for improved risk-based control measures to reduce opportunities of HPAIV to be transmitted from wild birds to poultry and vice versa, between poultry farms and to mammalian hosts, including humans."

Once such a nanoparticle has been trapped, I want to subject it to a high frequency alternating electric field and study the particles response to this field in time. Before I can start applying a high frequency alternating electric field, I first want to check for the expected behavior to different
electric fields of which one knows what the response should be. These electric fields lie within the low and middle frequency regime. When both symmetric and asymmetric electric fields within the low frequency regime (f < 10000 Hz) are applied, the results for the measured ingoing electric field and the response of the nanoparticles are similar. However, when the mid frequency regime (10000 Hz < f < 250000 Hz) is reached, the measured ingoing electric field and the response of the nanoparticles start showing different results."

What Do Narcissists Want to Feel? Exploring the Relationship between the Narcissistic Phenotypes and Emotion Goals,"['Chems-Maarif, Ryad']","['Spantidaki Kyriazi, F.']",2022-12-31T01:00:59Z,EN,['narcissism; grandiose narcissism; vulnerable narcissism; emotion goals; emotion regulation; motivation; personality'],Clinical Psychology,"Vulnerability and grandiosity constitute the two main phenotypes of narcissism. Each subtype is associated with different emotional experiences and regulatory processes, which are hypothesized to be underpinned by different motivations. Recently, research on emotion regulation gave birth to a new construct, namely Emotion Goals, which include motivational aspects to the regulation of desired affect. As such, this study aims to explore the correlations between grandiose and vulnerable narcissism and various emotion goals (i.e. what people want to feel). Participants (N = 109) completed measures of narcissism (i.e. FFNI) and emotion goals (i.e. Joy, Fear, Pride, Shame, Guilt, Empathy, Sadness and Anger). Emotions were assessed on how much they were desired, generally and within specific contexts (i.e. collaboration and fight). The results suggest similarities and differences in emotion goals between the two phenotypes. Both grandiosity and vulnerability were associated with a desire to generally feel Fear and Anger, and to feel Joy and Pride in the context of a fight. Still, differences existed in that grandiose narcissism correlated with wanting to feel less Empathy, both generally and in the context of collaboration. On the other hand, vulnerability was associated with the wish to feel Sadness and Guilt generally, and to feel Sadness in the context of collaboration. Such results can inform theoretical and empirical inquiries about the narcissistic personality, and be used by clinicians to better understand the emotional dynamics of narcissistic individuals to foster a working therapeutic alliance and to better address their intrapersonal and interpersonal functioning."
'Less is more?' - The effects of ICT on Dutch student performance examining the PISA,"['Meijer, Pim']","['Grift, Yolanda']",2022-12-31T01:00:57Z,EN,['ICT; Education Outcomes; Home & School; Pisa; The Netherlands'],Economic Policy,"In the limelight of the large-scale investments and dependence on information and

applied to assess the effect on math, reading and science performance of Dutch 15-year

subject and performance level of the student. Generally, ICT availability at schools as well 
as ICT use at home for school purposes shows negative effects on the PISA results of the 
students. While both are significant, the ICT availability at school shows consistent 
negative results across all models but later robustness test shows that most of this effect is 
originated from the bottom-performing students. The results provide relevant information 
for guiding policy decisions for improving the academic performance of students and 
evidence that solely relying on ICT investments do not guarantee a positive impact on

Suspended extrusion-based bioprinting to establish a 3D in vitro model of a neural network to study Parkinson’s disease,"['Vos, Dieuwke de']","['Levato, Riccardo']",2022-12-31T00:00:59Z,EN,"['neural network, bioprinting, disease modelling, LUHMES cells, GelMA']",Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"Parkinson’s disease is a common disorder that affects a rapidly increasing number of people worldwide. In Parkinson’s disease, cells of the central nervous system stop working or even die, resulting tremors, stiffness, balancing issues, rigidity, and many other problems. The disease usually starts in adulthood and progresses over time, but no cure has been found yet. Therefore, it is important to study Parkinson’s to reveal the causes and effects of the disease. Traditionally, we do this in simplified 2D models, which do not properly mimic the 3D environment of cells in the brain, or in animal models, which do not consist of human cells, meaning they cannot properly replicate human diseases. Therefore, in this project, we tried to print a small 3D piece of human brain tissue, as a more life-like prototype version of a disease model that we can use to study Parkinson’s in the future. 3D bioprinting is a relatively new method in medicine to develop human tissue by extruding inks consisting of living cells, called bioinks, in a desired architecture. After the cells are printed, they can proliferate, specialize and mature to form a wide variety of tissues, including bone and cartilage. This tissue can be used for implantation into the body after injury or disease or it can be used in the lab to study disease mechanisms, as in our case.

First, we developed and characterized a support bath consisting of modified gelatin into which a bioink could be printed to prevent the collapse of the printed construct and to keep the cells of the construct in the right place. Since the brain consists of a high number of neurons in a relatively fluid environment, we replicated this by using soft, water-rich materials. Then, we printed with three different bioinks, consisting of cells and additional material to encapsulate the cells for protection and to make the ink flow smoothly out of the cartridge. Because cells generally do not like the printing process and easily get stressed or harmed, sturdy cells from the connective tissue were used to set-up and improve the printing process in the first part of the project. When that was established, embryonic stem cells were used in the second part of the project. They functioned as a precursor for the desired cells making up the construct in the third and last part of the project: neural cells. In this part, we added additional materials to the support bath and bioink to which the cells could bind to stimulate the formation of extensions of their cell body. These extensions are nerve fibers, which are essential for communication between neurons and the establishment of a well-functioning network that allows our central nervous system to perform actions. 

In this project, we showed that the newly developed support bath was suitable for 3D printing of all three cell types and that they survived the printing process well. We can conclude that neural cells bioprinted into the support bath that was reinforced with additional materials, were able to specialize and become neurons. They formed many nerve fibers extending out to each other in multiple directions to form a 3D network. These promising results support a new strategy for printing soft constructs, which may help researchers worldwide to improve disease models, including those for Parkinson’s. These may be applied in research, for drug-testing, and personalized medicine in the future."
CLASSIFICATIONS AND TERMINOLOGIES FOR MAPPING THE INDICATION AND ORPHAN CONDITION IN REGULATORY DOCUMENTS,"['Jadoenathmisier, Keerti']","['Egberts, A.C.G.']",2022-12-21T01:01:31Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Informatie over de regulatoire aspecten van geneesmiddelen wordt op verschillende online platforms gepubliceerd. Zo heeft het geneesmiddelbewakingsorgaan van Europa, de European Medicines Agency (EMA) haar eigen website als voornaamste bron van informatie. Maar, andere instanties publiceren data omtrent geneesmiddelen op hun eigen website. Dit maakt het voor belanghebbenden vaak moeilijk om de voor hun relevante informatie te vinden. Om dit te vergemakkelijken heeft het nationale geneesmiddelbewakingsorgaan van Nederland, het College ter Beoordeling van Geneesmiddelen, in samenwerking met de Universiteit Utrecht een database ontworpen om de belangrijkste regulatoire gegevens van geneesmiddelen samen te brengen op een platform. Dit platform bevat informatie die betrekking heeft op alle door de EMA goedgekeurde geneesmiddelen van 1995 tot heden. Een belangrijke variabel voor de database, is de indicatie of aandoening waarvoor een geneesmiddel is goedgekeurd. Om dit aan de database toe te voegen moet deze informatie eerst gestructureerd worden. Om dit zo efficiënt mogelijk te doen, kan er gebruik gemaakt worden van ziekte classificaties en terminologieën. Er zijn echter verschillende classificaties en terminologieën beschikbaar om ziekten in kaart te brengen. Het doel van dit verslag is om een overzicht te geven van classificaties en terminologieën die het best voor regulatoire doeleinden gebruikt kunnen worden.
De classificaties en terminologieën die wij het meest geschikt achten in deze context zijn ICD-11, SNOMED-CT, MeSH, MedDRA, Orphanet en Disease Ontology. We hebben het ontstaan, doel en de structuur van deze ontologieën besproken en zijn in gegaan op hun voor- en nadelen. Vervolgens hebben we deze ontologieën in werking gezet en beoordeeld of ze geschikt zijn om de indicatie en/of aandoening waarvoor een geneesmiddel goedgekeurd is te structureren. Dit hebben wij gedaan voor de laatste 20 geneesmiddelen die t/m 17 november 2022 een wees aanwijzing kregen. Dat betekent dat deze geneesmiddelen te gebruiken zijn voor zeldzaam voorkomende aandoeningen. We hebben de weesaandoening van deze geneesmiddelen van de website van de Europese Commissie gehaald en de indicatie uit hun Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Vervolgens hebben we in de verschillende ontologieën gezocht naar trefwoorden van de indicatie en weesaandoening en hebben we gekeken naar van hoeveel detail elke ontologie ons kan voorzien.
We hebben gevonden dat elke ontologie verschillende gradaties van detail biedt en dat dit direct gerelateerd is aan hun doel. Zo is MedDRA gericht op het voorzien van informatie omtrent de bijwerkingen van geneesmiddelen, terwijl Orphanet zich specifiek richt op het classificeren van weesaandoeningen. Dit maakt het kiezen van één ontologie om de aandoening of indicatie te structureren nogal moeilijk. Echter, uit alle geteste ontologieën gaf SNOMED-CT ons de meest omvattende beschrijving van de ziekten en voldoende hoeveelheid details. Op basis hiervan en de verschillende andere toepassingen die SNOMED-CT biedt, raden wij SNOMED-CT als meest geschikte ontologie aan voor regulatoire doeleinden."

Depleting microtubules: How low can we go?","['Bobeldijk, Misko']","['Akhmanova, A.S.']",2022-12-31T00:00:52Z,EN,['CLASP; microtubules; nucleation; Ninein; centrosome; golgi'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Microtubules are indispensable components of the cellular cytoskeleton, responsible for maintaining cellular integrity. They are polar structures that form through the polymerization of αβ-tubulin heterodimers. On its own, spontaneous nucleation of microtubules is energetically unfavorable. Despite this, molecular factors like the gamma-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) can promote nucleation. Following their nucleation, microtubules are inherently unstable, constantly fluctuating between phases of growth and shrinkage, termed dynamic instability. An extensive group of regulatory proteins modulates this dynamic instability and collectively form the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). This regulation is required for an array of microtubule-based processes, such as, microtubule-based transport, cell division, and the organization of intracellular machinery throughout the cytosol. One such regulatory MAP, Cytoplasmic-linker-associated proteins (CLASPs) inhibit catastrophe and stabilize microtubules at their growing ends, tether and stabilize free microtubule ends at the Golgi, promote microtubule nucleation at the Golgi, and repair damaged microtubules by incorporating new tubulin heterodimers at damaged-sites. Here, we present CLASP as a more robust regulator of the microtubule network in cells than a microtubule polymerase like chTOG. We show that retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE1) thoroughly depleted of CLASPs have severe reductions in microtubule density and organization. Microtubules in these cells grow slightly faster and have decreased catastrophe frequencies, likely owing to a higher pool of free tubulin and a stable remaining population of microtubules. Furthermore, we report that microtubule nucleation from the Golgi and cytosol are perturbed almost wholly, whereas centrosomal-based microtubule nucleation is reduced in the absence of CLASPs. Moreover, we show a substantial reduction in γ-TuRC, NEDD1, and Ninein, but not Pericentrin, CEP152, CEP192, and CDK5RAP2 localization to the centrosome, yet this does not translate to the robust decrease in microtubule density we observe in the absence of CLASPs. We also present a p53 knock-out based strategy that intriguingly improves the viability of microtubule scarce cells. Removing the centrosome in cells lacking CLASPs reduced the microtubule density even further, which to our knowledge has not been observed before, revealing a critical threshold of microtubule density required for the proper organization and distribution of organelles throughout the cell. "
"Evaluation of post-mortem urine dipstick test and setting up of semi-quantification for benzodiazepines, tramadol, morphine and oxycodone on the LC-MS/MS","['Gill, Iris']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-12-31T00:00:37Z,EN,['dipstick; LC-MS/MS; post-mortem urine; post-mortem blood; toxicology; semi-quantification'],Drug Innovation,"Reliability of Post-mortem urine dIpstiCk test 
Death investigations are conducted by the police, a Public Health Service (GGD) and a forensic doctor to determine the cause of death. In case of a (suspected) unnatural death, post-mortem blood and urine samples, if available, are sent to the pharmacological laboratory of the Erasmus MC for toxicological research. Additionally, a urine dipstick test is used at the crime scene to give a quick indication of the presence of 10 or 12 drugs in the urine. The research question is: How often do discrepancies occur between the urine dipstick test strips of cocaine, MDMA and THC and the toxicological test on blood performed by LC-MS/MS? In this retrospective study, a database was created in Castor EDC in which the results of all previously performed urine dipstick tests and toxicological tests performed on the LC-MS/MS could be gathered. Due to time limitations, only 311 cases were put in this database, of which 164 cases were included for this study. Overall concordance of the cocaine dipstick results with the toxicological test results on blood by LC-MS/MS was 97%, with 3.0% false negative cocaine dipstick test strips (n=5). For MDMA, the overall concordance was 97.6%, with 1.2% false negative (n=2) and 1.2% false positive (n=2) MDMA dipstick test strips. Finally, the overall concordance for THC was 86.0%, with 0.6% false negative (n=1) and 13.4% false positive (n=22) THC dipstick test strips. There was a discrepancy between the urine dipstick test and the toxicological test on the LC-MS/MS on blood in 3.0% of the cases for cocaine, 2.4% for MDMA and 14% for THC. Possible explanations for false negative results are a low drug concentration in urine, consumption of the drug shortly before death and dilution of urine by decomposition fluids. Possible explanations for false positive dipstick results of MDMA and THC are a lower sensitivity of the LC-MS/MS, post-mortem redistribution and formation of amino acids after a high PMI. In the future, the database will be filled with more cases, which will help recognizing patterns of factors that could be responsible for the false negative and false positive dipsticks, also for the other 9 dipstick test strips.

Setting up of semi-quantification for benzodiazepines, tramadol, morphine and oxycodone on the LC-MS/MS
Blood can be sent to the Erasmus MC for a toxicological screening, which can be conducted on two LC-MS/MS systems, called micro 1 and micro 2. Semi-quantification of different analytes has been set up, so that estimations can be made about these concentrations that can be interpreted as either sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, supra-therapeutic or toxic. In this project, semi-quantification for benzodiazepines was set up on the micro 1. Subsequently, semi-quantification for tramadol, morphine and oxycodone were set up on both the micro 1 and micro 2. Plasma was spiked with different concentrations of the benzodiazepines, tramadol, morphine and oxycodone. These samples were then prepared to be measured on the LC-MS/MS. All these concentrations were measured 15 times on the applicable LC-MS/MS system. Responses were calculated for each measurement and relative standard deviations (RSDs) were calculated for each chosen concentration. Calibration curves were made to obtain the equations necessary for semi-quantification. Semi-quantification can be set up for benzodiazepines, tramadol, morphine and oxycodone based on these data, except for oxazepam on the micro 1 and morphine on the micro 2 LC-MS/MS system. In the future, validation must take place periodically for all the different analytes for which semi-quantification has been set up."
Topological Wannier Excitons in Bismuth Chalcogenide Nanosheets,"['Maisel Licerán, Lucas']","['Stoof, H.T.C.']",2022-12-31T01:00:47Z,EN,['Excitons; Topological insulators; Semiconductors; Solid-state physics; Low-energy physics'],Theoretical Physics,"Current optoelectronic technologies depend crucially on insulators and semiconductors, whose response to photoexcitation at room temperature is largely dominated by bound electron-hole pairs known as excitons. While the physics of excitons in regular materials are very well understood, knowledge of their behavior in topological insulators is still severely limited. These novel phases of matter are receiving much attention due to their excellent prospects for energy-efficient electronics, (pseudo)spintronics devices and quantum-information processing. Therefore, a full understanding of light-matter interactions in these materials requires the investigation of physical and topological properties of bulk excitons.

In this work, we analyze the topology and dispersion of bulk Wannier excitons in thin nanosheets of bismuth selenide (Bi₂Se₃), a prototypical three-dimensional topological insulator. We find that excitons inherit the topology of the underlying electronic band structure, quantified by the winding numbers of the constituent electron and hole pseudospins as a function of the total exciton momentum. We also show that every s-wave exciton state consists of a nonchiral doublet of degenerate states with quadratic dispersion for low momenta, as well as a chiral doublet with one linear mode and one quadratic mode. We derive an effective model for the chiral excitons and consider their topological properties. Furthermore, we analyze the many-body screening due to the coherent surface states on the effective bulk electron-hole interaction, and consider the effect of surface plasmons. Our study is backed up by self-consistent numerical calculations and paints a complete picture of bulk excitons in quasi-two-dimensional topological materials with a band inversion at the Γ point. This picture can now in principle be used for the investigation of interactions between excitons themselves and other excitations such as plasmons and photons."
Momento de defender lo conquistado.

This new context is characterized by the presence of a conservative approach that ceases the development of the rights agenda that characterized previous administrations, directly attacking the legalization of abortion.
	To achieve the previous objectives, this thesis offers a theoretical review that examines the challenges that feminist organizations in Uruguay have faced throughout their existence to achieve visibility in the public space. This visibility is considered necessary to problematize private issues so that they can become part of the government's agenda. Additionally, considering that there is a strong presence of expressions against feminist advances on behalf of government representatives, it is proposed to explore the spread of antifeminist discourses in the public sphere and how they affect the presentation of feminist demands and the feminist's public perception itself.
	By conducting semi-structured interviews with feminist activists involved in the defense of sexual and reproductive rights, a new configuration of context is identified that places the feminist movement and its demands on the side of the government's opposition. This new situation enables the generation of discourses and actions with the capacity to impact negatively on the public perception of the feminist movement, limiting its capacity for action. Furthermore, it promotes a series of strategies that the feminist movement has begun to develop in response to conservative reactions. These strategies aim to maintain a public presence to ensure that their demands do not lose visibility, preventing the establishment of biased visions. In addition, a need to establish strategies of contention and care among activists, promoting the intergenerational exchanges of experiences, is identified."
Functional characterization of centriolar proteins CEP120 and SPICE1,"['Vreman, Tessa']","['Akhmanova, A.S.']",2022-12-31T00:00:48Z,EN,['centrosome; centriole; CEP120; SPICE1; in vitro reconstitution; microtubules'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Animal cells have a cytoskeleton that gives them their shape and structure, just like the skeleton does with a whole organism. The cytoskeleton consists of three components: actin filaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules. All three components have a slightly different function, but we will focus on the microtubules in this study. As the name says, microtubules are small, hollow tubes. They are formed by the protein tubulin and stretch throughout the cell to form a network. Besides their structural function, microtubules are also important in intracellular transport. The microtubule network is organized by a small structure called the centrosome. This centrosome is located near the nucleus of the cell, and from there, the microtubules extend through the whole cell. 
The centrosome is formed by two centrioles that are arranged perpendicularly. Centrioles are cylinders built from microtubules and centriolar proteins. The centrioles are approximately 500 nm long in human cells. Centriolar proteins are proteins that are located at the centrioles and perform their function there. The structure of the centrosome is crucial for the microtubules to be able to grow and form the network as they should. Besides the centrosome's normal function in the cell, it also has a role in mitosis. During cell division, the centrosome is duplicated and the two centrosomes form the mitotic spindles that help divide the genome evenly over the two cells. If there is a problem with genome distribution, this can lead to issues with the newly formed cells or even cancer. There are also diseases that are caused by poorly or non-functioning centrosomes, and more specifically, problems with the centriolar proteins. Because issues with the centrosome can have disastrous results, it is vital to understand their function better. A better understanding of the centrosome could help treat diseases caused by issues with the centrosome.
After each cell division, the centrosome needs to be duplicated because each daughter cell only receives one centrosome consisting of two centrioles. For a new centrosome to form, two new centrioles need to grow from the two existing centrioles. This duplication happens during a process called centriole biogenesis. It is important that this process goes well since two functioning centrosomes are crucial for further cell divisions and the functioning of the daughter cells. The centrosomal proteins mentioned before are also involved during centrosome biogenesis. The centrosome cannot assemble and thus function properly without the centriolar proteins. However, there are many different centriolar proteins and not for all of them, their role in centriole biogenesis is uncovered. In this study, we look at two centrosomal proteins called CEP120 and SPICE1. Of these two proteins, the function in the centrosome is not entirely clear yet. With different experimental techniques, we will try to elucidate the role of CEP120 and SPICE1 in the centrosome. We used the fluorescent proteins GFP and mCherry to visualize the two proteins of interest. In this way, we can observe them under a microscope and analyze their behavior. We found effects and interactions of CEP120 and SPICE1 that could be important in centriole biogenesis."
MGTCOM: Community Detection in Temporal Multimodal Graphs,"['Dmitriev, Egor']","['Chekol, Mel']",2022-12-31T00:01:04Z,EN,['community detection;representation learning;dynamic networks'],Computing Science,"Community detection is the task of discovering groups of nodes sharing similar patterns within a network.
With recent advancements in deep learning, methods utilizing graph representation learning and deep clustering have shown great results in community detection.
However, these methods often rely on the topology of networks (i) ignoring important features such as network heterogeneity, temporality, multimodality and other possibly relevant features.
Besides, (ii) the number of communities is not known a priori and is often left to model selection.
In addition, (iii) in multimodal networks all nodes are assumed to be symmetrical in their features; while true for homogeneous networks, most of the real-world networks are heterogeneous where feature availability varies.
In this paper, we propose a novel framework (named MGTCOM) that overcomes the above challenges (i)--(iii). MGTCOM allows to discover dynamic communities through multimodal feature learning by leveraging a new sampling technique for unsupervised learning of temporal embeddings. Importantly, MGTCOM is an end-to-end framework optimizing network embeddings, communities, and the number of communities in tandem.
In order to assess its performance, we carried out an extensive evaluation on a number of multimodal networks.
We found out that our method is competitive against state-of-the-art and performs well under the inductive setting."
The Role of Ninein in the Regulation of Microtubule Organization at the Centrosome,"['Sandron, Arianna']","['Akhmanova, A.S.']",2022-12-31T00:00:54Z,EN,['ninein; centrosome; microtubules; nucleation; anchoring'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Many fundamental cellular processes, such as the transport of intracellular cargos and the segregation of mitotic chromosomes, depend on the spatiotemporal regulation of microtubule networks. Specific subcellular compartments, named Microtubule Organizing Centers (MTOCs), are involved in this crucial and delicate function by controlling microtubule nucleation and anchoring. The centrosome represents the major MTOC of eukaryotic cells, and it is composed of a pair of orthogonal centrioles surrounded by the highly dense and protein-rich pericentriolar material (PCM). The PCM proteins can interact directly and indirectly with nucleating complexes and with newly made microtubules, thus promoting nucleation and ensuring microtubule anchoring. In which way many of these proteins fulfill these functions is, however, currently poorly understood. Further studies are therefore needed in order to elucidate more precisely the dynamics of centrosomal microtubule organization.
In this project, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology and Knock-Down via RNA interference to investigate the role of Ninein, a protein resident on the mother centriole, in the regulation of microtubule organization. Ninein is known to be essential for proper anchoring of microtubules, but the mechanism underlying its role are still not known. Whether Ninein can cover a role in microtubule nucleation remains as well to be determined.
We show that Ninein localizes to the centrosome through its C-terminal domain and that its depletion severely impairs the normal microtubule density at the centrosome. Importantly, we demonstrate  that Ninein and γ-tubulin do not interact, and that γ-tubulin levels at the centrosome are not affected by Ninein’s depletion. We found that the late stage of microtubule regrowth, but not the early one, is impaired in the absence of Ninein. Finally, we demonstrate that CLASP2 levels at the centrosome are dramatically decreased in Ninein Knockout cells, and that Ninein binds to the C-terminal domain of CLASP2 trough a coiled-coil domain located in the 601-1050 amino acidic region.
In conclusion, by providing information about the contribution of Ninein to the processes of  microtubule nucleation and anchoring, our work helped to gain new insights in the regulation of microtubule organization at the centrosome."

One of its consequences, sea-level rise, impacts coastlines all over the world leading to mass displacement of people in coastal regions. Around 10 per cent of all people live in coastal areas less than 10m above sea level1. In the Netherlands, a housing crisis is ongoing, and space on land is limited. To tackle these problems simultaneously, floating houses might be a good solution. 

Moreover, buildings tend to degrade rather than enhance the natural environment, contributing to climate change and biodiversity loss. The goal of this research is to design the most sustainable student homes in the Netherlands, on a boat. This project will act as a prototype of a scalable concept, which can be applied in coastal regions in the Netherlands and internationally. 

Sustainability reaches further than minimising harmful environmental effects, therefore the project seeks to go a step further by aiming to deliver a positive contribution to its natural surroundings. This is called ‘regenerative design’. The central question is what factors a prototype for floating housing would need to make the local natural environment thrive. 
For the design, a 67-meter-long inland vessel is used as a case study. It is situated in a highly urbanised region prone to flooding due to rising sea levels. The focus group is students. As a method, first, examples of other (floating) buildings are studied. Lessons from these projects form the basis for further research, and the design. For the design inspiration is taken by applying biomimicry. This is a discipline that takes inspiration from nature and biology to develop new ideas and innovations. 

Four system functions from the reference projects that further guide the research are regulating water, increasing biodiversity, storing energy & balancing temperature, and material usage. Focus is especially on the first and the second of these system functions. 

While the level of regenerativity can still be increased, the design poses an example of what is possible with today’s technologies. The design does sketch a clear vision of what the system could look like, which is a major contribution to bringing the design into reality. Lastly, the impact of a good example should not be underestimated. It can steer other developments in the neighbourhood or other coastal regions into a more sustainable or regenerative state and therefore have a higher impact than the local environmental impact of the project alone."
A retrospective analysis of anaesthesia-related morbidity and mortality in horses in a University teaching hospital in the Netherlands,"['Boessen, Laurens']","['Grauw, Janny de']",2022-12-31T00:00:34Z,EN,['anaesthesia; equine; mortality; morbidity; risk; factors; horse'],Equine Health Care,"Objectives: To establish the anaesthesia-related (=AR) mortality and morbidity rate, and the factors influencing them, of all horses undergoing standing sedation (for surgical or diagnostic imaging procedures) or undergoing general anaesthesia in a Dutch equine academic teaching hospital. Furthermore, to determine whether the AR mortality and morbidity rates changed during the past years, compared to previous results from the same hospital and to international published figures.

Study design: A retrospective observational single-centre study.

Research population: In total, 3074 horses anaesthetised or sedated for standing procedures between September 2013 and September 2019.

Methods: All patient information and details of the case were retrieved from patient records. This included presence of potential pre-defined risk factors, as well as occurrence of AR morbidities within 7 days post-anaesthesia and AR mortality status at 7 days post-anaesthesia. For various subsets of the population, AR mortality and morbidity rates were determined. Chi-squared tests and Wald tests were used to establish multivariate logistic regression models to analyse potential risk factors associated with overall AR mortality, overall AR morbidity, AR mild trauma, AR myopathy and AR gastro-intestinal morbidities (e.g. post-anaesthetic colic).

Results: The combined (surgical and diagnostic procedures under general anaesthesia or during standing sedations) overall (elective and non-elective cases) AR mortality and morbidity rates were 0.8% and 4.8%, respectively. Restricting the analysis to the combined (surgical and diagnostic procedures under general anaesthesia or during standing sedations) elective group solely, percentages decreased to 0.2% and 3.2%, respectively. When the elective group was further restricted to procedures involving general anaesthesia (either surgical cases alone or together with diagnostic cases), the percentages were 0.2% and 3.8%, respectively. For the combined (surgical and diagnostic procedures under general anaesthesia or during standing sedations) non-elective procedures, the percentages are 2.5% and 9.6%, respectively. 
Multivariate logistic regression models for the combined (surgical and diagnostic procedures under general anaesthesia or during standing sedations) elective group resulted in significant risk factors for the overall AR morbidity and for two of the three most frequent AR morbidities identified in this study (AR mild trauma and AR gastro-intestinal morbidities).
Multivariate logistic regression models for the combined (surgical and diagnostic procedures under general anaesthesia or during standing sedations) non-elective group resulted in significant risk factors for the overall AR morbidity and for two of the three most frequent AR morbidities identified in this study (AR mild trauma and AR myopathy).

Conclusion: The data suggests a decrease in AR mortality over the past 6 years, compared to both previous data from this clinic and to internationally reported percentages. While AR morbidity may seem to have increased, this is likely due to the different definitions used for some morbidities (especially AR mild trauma) and in this light may actually be lower than the rates previously published by other studies. Further research to refine risk factors (e.g. body condition score instead of body weight) is important so that the AR mortality and morbidity risks can be reduced even further over the coming years. Most importantly, universally accepted definitions of complications and uniform methods to establish outcome need to be drawn up in order for future studies to be less heterogeneous and more directly comparable."
Real-time imputation of missing predictor values in clinical practice,"['Nijman, steven']","['Debray, T.P.A.']",2022-12-23T01:01:01Z,EN,['missing data; clinical; individual risk prediction; disease trends; personalized healthcare; imputation; multiple imputation'],Epidemiology Postgraduate,"The identification of individual patients at risk of disease has become an integral part of recent trends towards a more personalized healthcare system. A healthcare system that is personalized allows us to administer the most applicable treatment to an individual patient given their risk profile and, in turn,  make our healthcare much more efficient. To that end, clinical prediction models are situated as prime candidates to assist clinicians with accurate risk estimates. By harnessing the information captured in various patient or disease related properties, these risk prediction models are able to chart a likely path that a disease might take (i.e., prognosis) or identify whether a specific disease is likely present in individual patients (i.e., diagnosis). 

Recent efforts to computerize the use of various clinical prediction models in clinical practice have provided clinical decision support systems (CDSS) that are already usable in clinical practice. These CDSS already allow clinicians to potentially inform  their clinical decision making by providing individual risk probabilities. However, because currently available risk prediction models require complete information to generate predictions, these models are severely hampered whenever any patient or disease properties are missing. Luckily, the ample guidance that exists on the handling of missing data provides useful stepping stones to develop flexible or missing data handling techniques usable in real-time clinical practice.

The development of several imputation methods for missing predictor values in real-time were presented previously. In a case-study with a real-world empirical data set for cardiovascular risk prediction, the accuracy of two common imputation methods which were adjusted for use in real time clinical practice were compared. These consisted of conditional modeling imputation (CMI, where for each predictor a separate multivariable imputation model is derived) and joint modeling imputation (JMI, where we assume all predictors are normally distributed and use the observed patient information to generate imputations for each missing predictor).  These methodologies were compared with a method which is often used in practice: mean imputation (where missing values are replaced by the sample mean). Congruent with expectations, simulations found that both JMI and CMI are generally to be recommended in terms of imputation accuracy. As JMI was generally faster and less complex, it was deemed more promising.

This previous study evaluated these novel imputation methods strictly on their imputation accuracy in terms of their root mean squared error. In this study we continue with the more promising imputation method (i.e., JMI) and evaluate it using common evaluation methods for prediction models (i.e., discrimination and calibration of the model predictions). We specifically focus on the use of additional, or auxiliary, variables (i.e., variables not part of the prediction model), elaborate further on the idea of imputation model updating and make a comparison with the often-used method mean imputation. In summary, the use of JMI is found to be most beneficial when estimated in local data and with the use of these auxiliary variables. Its added value is most prominent whenever the missing predictors are correlated with other observed (auxiliary) variables."

Therefore, we propose a conceptual framework for organizations to assess their business process management (BPM) initiative for LCDP suitability. The framework is developed through a study of literature, a focus group, and expert interviews, resulting in 18 factors to be considered by organizations. An evaluation using fictitious use case analyses showed that the model was well-received, especially with regard to its completeness and operationality.

Usage of passive air samplers in exposure assessment – a look at pesticides,"['Stoker, Joeri']","['Hoek, Gerard']",2022-12-23T01:01:02Z,EN,['Passive air samplers;pesticides;models;exposure;risk assessment'],Toxicology and Environmental Health,"The increasing amount of chemicals used around the globe has also increased the risk of disease through exposure to these compounds. A subcategory are pesticides, which are the subject of this study. The focus on monitoring pesticide exposure through food and/or occupational risk leaves exposure through inhalation understudied. Therefore a risk assessment is performed for residents of rural areas in the Netherlands, living near agricultural fields treated with pesticides. To monitor air concentrations of pesticides two main methods are available: Active and Passive air samplers (AAS & PAS). AAS allow for precise measurements but have disadvantages in cost, ease of deployment and noise. PAS do not suffer from these disadvantages however the measurements are still imprecise. The cause is that the precise sampling rate (R) of the PAS has to be estimated. This study utilizes three methods to extrapolate PAS measurements towards ng per cubic meter of air. I) A set value of R = 4, II) windspeed-derived individual sampling rate per PAS, and III) a linear model using environmental conditions. The results of predicted concentrations of each method were compared and varied in precision. For pendimethalin the methods resulted in a r-squared of; I) 0.18, II) 0.18, III) 0.40. The chlorpropham results were; I) 0.31, II) 0.31, III) 0.71. Taking environmental conditions like temperature and humidity into account does show promise. This can enable future research to build further on these kind of models and allow for more accurate estimations using PAS."

Oceanic and Atmospheric Controls on Decadal Ice Shelf Basal Melt Variability around the Amundsen Sea,"['Janzing, Joren']","['Wal, Roderik van de']",2022-12-24T01:00:49Z,EN,['Antarctica; Amundsen Sea; Ice shelves;  Ocean; 1940s; Decadal variability;'],Marine Sciences,"Warm ocean waters are driving the rapid ice loss around the Amundsen Sea, Antarctica. Decadal variability
in melt and on-shelf heat transport is thought to be controlled by zonal shelf break winds and Pacific sea
surface temperatures, leading to the hypothesis that a strong El Ni ̃no in the 1940s initiated the present-day
glacier retreat. This report investigates the controls on decadal melt variability by analysing simulations
from a regional ocean model for the Amundsen Sea. This model was forced by an ensemble of 20 global
climate model simulations for the years 1920 until 2014.
Ice shelf basal mass loss has a strong connection with heat advection in seabed troughs in the simula-
tions. Averaged over the ensemble, zonal shelf break winds and the El Ni ̃no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are
weakly correlated with basal mass loss. Individual members show a large spread, likely related to regional
factors such as the Amundsen Sea Low and local factors such as sea ice and shelf water properties. Variability
in baroclinic flow and salinity at the western shelf break suggest that melt could be sensitive to freshwater
fluxes from ice shelves and sea ice. The occurrence of a large melt event in the 1940s depends on these
factors. Finally, simulations with an advanced grounding line have minimal influence on decadal variability.
Since ocean boundary conditions are fixed, the internal variability in the model is thus atmospherically forced.
The results underscore the importance of using a model ensemble and long time scales when modelling this
system. Furthermore, the limited influence of large scale atmospheric forcing on melt makes accurate future
projections more difficult. Further research is necessary to disentangle internal feedbacks and forcings."

Voor een lange tijd is het aangenomen dat intelligentie een eigenschap was die uniek is voor de mens. Echter, wanneer er in de natuur gekeken wordt zien we vele voorbeelden van intelligentie. Hierdoor wordt er onderzoek gedaan naar de evolutie van intelligentie bij dieren zodat we kunnen ontdekken hoe intelligentie is ontstaan. Dieren die veel onderzocht worden zijn de zeer intelligente primaten, waardoor de meest gangbare hypotheses zijn ontworpen rond primaten. Aangezien primaten ook zeer sociaal zijn wordt er gedacht dat naast omgevingsfactoren er ook sociale factoren zijn die correleren met de evolutie van intelligentie en wellicht ten grondslag liggen hieraan.
De resultaten van onderzoek in primaten zijn niet altijd eenduidig wanneer ze worden toegepast op andere dieren, waardoor meer onderzoek nodig is. Recentelijk zijn vogels betrokken bij het onderzoek naar de evolutie van intelligentie, aangezien deze ook zeer intelligent kunnen zijn. Kraaiachtigen zijn een groep vogels die zowel intelligent zijn, en daardoor relevant voor het beantwoorden van de onderzoeksvraag, en sociaal, waardoor de goed te vergelijken zijn met o.a. primaten. Hiernaast hebben ze in hun evolutionaire geschiedenis deels gelijke ecologische omstandigheden meegemaakt als primaten, maar hebben ze anders opgebouwde hersenen. Door het vergelijken van de huidige omgevingsfactoren en hoe ze werken op het brein hopen we zaken te identificeren die wijzen op een drijvende factor voor de groei van het brein welke intelligentie kan ondersteunen.
Uit dit onderzoek in vogels komen, net als bij primaten, tegenstrijdige antwoorden. Verschillende omgevingsfactoren en sociale factoren correleren met cognitief vergevorderd gedrag, terwijl ze in andere, vergelijkbare onderzoeken geen steun vinden. Het verkrijgen van een eenduidig antwoord wordt vermoeilijkt door het meten met verschillende standaarden wanneer het gaat om de mate van ontwikkeling van het brein. Ook worden er vaak hele onderzoeken gedaan toegespitst op één vraag in slecht één soort, waardoor er uiteenlopende methodes ontstaan die vergelijken moeilijk maken, en waarbij relevante (omgevings)factoren onvoldoende worden meegenomen. Ook kan het mogelijk zijn dat er wordt gekeken naar gedragingen die geen goede afspiegeling zijn van de onderzoeksvraag of op een manier die niet ecologisch relevant is voor het dier waardoor het, bijvoorbeeld, de opdracht niet goed kan volgen.
Om verwarring tegen te gaan is het nodig om een methode te kiezen die past bij de vraag en te vergelijken is met ander onderzoek. Zo is er bijvoorbeeld veel bewijs dat bepaalde regionen van het brein van vogels specifiek zijn ontstaan voor bepaalde intelligentie relevant voor de soort, wat interessant is om specifiek te meten in plaats van alleen een klassieke aanpak die naar de grootte van het hele brein kijkt. Welke maatstaf er het best gevoerd kan worden is nog niet bekend. Wel is bekend dat het verzamelen van gedetailleerde, uitgebreide brein-morfologische, ecologische, sociale en cognitieve gegevens van vele individuen behorend tot vele soorten duidelijkheid kan opleveren. Hierbij is het aan te raden gebruik te maken van uitgebreide, soortgelijke cognitieve testen die tussen diersoorten vergeleken kunnen worden. Deze gedetailleerde gegevens kunnen met geavanceerde statistische modellen geanalyseerd worden om patronen te ontdekken op verschillende niveaus en een duidelijker antwoord te krijgen over de evolutie van intelligentie."
Huntingtin lowering therapies targeting RNA in Huntington’s Disease,"['Flapper, Jip']","['Hol, Elly']",2022-04-13T00:00:48Z,EN,['Huntington’s diseas; huntingtin protein; Targeting huntingtin RNA; antisense oligonucleotides; RNA interference; small molecule modulators'],Drug Innovation,"Huntington’s disease is characterized by a progressive deterioration of motor, behavioural and cognitive functioning. The disease is a dominantly autosomal inheritable neurodegenerative disease caused by a genetic mutation in the DNA encoding for the huntingtin protein. An extended CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene causes a gain of toxic properties of the huntingtin protein. Various cellular mechanisms do not function adequately, thereby progressively worsening the performance of multiple cellular pathways. Various animal studies have shown an therapeutic effectiveness of lowering mutant huntingtin levels, resulting in reduced downstream pathogenic effects. Reducing synthesis of mutant huntingtin can be achieved by targeting huntingtin RNA at a post-transcriptional level. Being close to the proximal cause of Huntington’s disease, together with the current ongoing human trials, makes RNA targeting currently the most relevant method for therapies applicable in the near future. Huntington’s disease patients express the mutant huntingtin as well as the wild-type huntingtin protein. Huntingtin lowering therapies can be designed in two specific ways. Firstly, the allele-selective approach, specifically targeting the mutant huntingtin. The second is in an non-allele specific manner, targeting both the mutant huntingtin and the wild-type huntingtin. The non-allele specific manner raises theoretical risks concerning normal cellular functioning after reduction of wild-type huntingtin levels, but has less limitations for effective targeting of mutant huntingtin RNA. Several reports suggest that lowering both mutant huntingtin and wild-type huntingtin is tolerable up to a certain range, resulting in an overall beneficial effect for Huntington’s disease patients. The methods that are efficient in modulating the translation at a post-transcriptional level, either allele selective or non-selective, include antisense oligonucleotides, RNA interference and small molecule modulators. The sequence specific targeting of antisense oligonucleotides allow for specific targeting of mutant huntingtin at pre-RNA level. Repeated intrathecal injection are required for a maintained therapeutic effect. Advantages of antisense oligonucleotides consist of relatively low invasive administration, ability for discontinuation of treatment and broader target range at the pre-RNA level. Disadvantages include need for multiple administrations and inability to spread to deeper brain structures. RNA interference targets RNA at a more downstream location compared to antisense oligonucleotide, reducing the range of possible targets in the processed RNA. RNA interference therapies are most commonly delivered using a viral vector after direct administration into deeper brain structures. Viral vector delivery enables a one time administration of the therapy, but posses a risk due to the inability to discontinue the treatment. The local delivery to the highly effected deeper brain regions could posses a major advantage. The oral availability and widespread action of small molecules make them an attractive approach, however a greater risks of possible off target effect is present. The advanced development and seemingly positive risk-benefit profile indicate that therapies targeting RNA for huntingtin lowering have great potential to be therapeutically beneficial for patients in the near future."
The Cancer Drugs Fund of England: improving access to innovative drugs or bypassing HTA informed decision-making?,"['Brinkhuis, Francine']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-04-13T00:00:40Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"In the UK, the number of new cancer cases grows strongly each year, and its performance on cancer survival is significantly lower than in comparable countries. Even though a considerable amount of new cancer drugs is being developed, many end up not being reimbursed by the National Health Service (NHS), as they are often determined not to be cost-effective, meaning that they do not demonstrate sufficient added benefit to the healthcare system in relation to the price that is set by the pharmaceutical industry. This has resulted in cancer patient groups in the UK to strongly criticize the methods of NICE, which is the agency that carries out these evaluations.

In 2011, the UK government established the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) in England to address these issues. With the former system of the CDF, all drugs that were not recommended by NICE for routine use in the NHS were eligible for funding, which was subject to a considerable amount of criticism; patients suffering from other diseases felt excluded, the fund overspent its budget, it did not collect data on the effectiveness of the funded treatments, and pharmaceutical companies were given an alternative way to market their expensive drugs that were determined not to be cost-effective. In 2016, the fund was reformed and introduced clearer entry and exit rules. In this renewed system, promising drugs that were associated with too weak clinical evidence to be recommended for reimbursement, were funded for a set period of time, while simultaneously the pharmaceutical company could submit supplementary evidence to proof its effectiveness. Additionally, a financial control mechanism was set up to prevent the fund from overspending its budget. Throughout its existence, the fund has helped over 168,000 patients to get access to a cancer treatment.

Some other countries in the UK and in Europe have employed similar policies to the CDF; England’s neighboring countries Wales and Northern Ireland, for example, have recently introduced policies that allow access to the same drugs that have an arrangement through the CDF, whereas Scotland established a fund that reimburses drugs for rare diseases on an individual basis. We advocate countries that wish to introduce a similar funding policy to: 1) focus on high unmet clinical need rather than a specific disease to prevent the prioritization of one therapeutic area; 2) not solely focus on reimbursing drugs, but also other health technologies (prevention, surgery, diagnostics, etc.); 3) make use of a financial control mechanism to prevent overspending; 4) collect data on the effectiveness of funded treatments in order to determine the impact of the policy; 5) integrate the policy in the existing evaluation process of cost effectiveness, while collaborating closely with all relevant stakeholders and make use of clear and transparent entry and exit criteria; 6) adhere to robust clinical evidence. In that way, access to innovative drugs will be improved, while simultaneously maximizing the added value for society."
"The Moderating Role of Psychological Flexibility in the Relationship Between

Despite the evidence of its deleterious effects on mental and physical health across all age 
groups, the majority of research has primarily focused on older cohorts, leaving young adults 
beyond the scope of scientific attention. The current study aims to compensate for this research 
inequity by examining whether there is an indication that psychological flexibility protects 
individuals against the negative effects of loneliness on well-being. It was hypothesized that the 
inverse relationship between loneliness and well-being would be significantly less pronounced 
among young adults with high, compared to low, psychological flexibility. The design of the 
study was cross-sectional. For the purpose of this research, 162 participants, between 18 and 30 
years of age, were recruited through social media. Data were collected online via self-reported 
psychological assessments of loneliness (Loneliness Scale), psychological flexibility (FIT-24) 
and well-being (SF-12) and were subsequently analyzed using linear regression analysis. 
According to the results, the two-way interaction between loneliness and psychological 
flexibility was not significantly associated with well-being (p = .45). The disconfirmation of the 
research hypothesis was attributed to the use of an unsuitable moderator and methodological 
shortcomings. Clinical and research implications include the documentation of the actual effects 
of psychological flexibility on well-being, which will be accomplished within longitudinal 
experimental designs, and the investigation of other moderating variables, including social 
engagement and emotion regulation styles. The research stands out in terms of novelty and 
cultural diversity, but could be improved in terms of methodology. Overall, despite the statistical 
insignificance that was observed, findings highlight the profound need to reduce the distress that 
may derive from loneliness."
The microbial composition of kefir fermented from raw milk,"['Ooijen, Luuk van']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-04-13T00:00:55Z,EN,"['Raw milk microbes, ITS, 16S, Amplicon sequencing, spike-in, Ratio micro-mycobiota, Kefir']",Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Aim: 
This research aims to elucidate the microbial composition and ratio between myco- and microbiota abundance of two raw milk kefir-style beverages (RMK). Produced by backslopping a traditionally with kefir-grains fermented raw milk kefir or by a commercially available defined starter culture. Additionally, kefir from pasteurized milk (PMK) was analysed to determine specific effects of raw milk on the microbial composition.
Methods: 
DNA extracted from kefir beverages was artificially spiked with a microbial standard containing known concentrations of fungal and bacterial genomic DNA. In order to avoid over or under spiking of the samples, a specific amount of spike-in was added in proportion to the sample bacterial genomic DNA content determined by qPCR, followed by metagenomic amplicon sequencing of the bacterial V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS1 region.
Results: 
Backslopping of traditional kefir changed the microbial composition with a decrease of Lactobacilli and an increase of Lactococcus species. Defined culture based RMK contained all the myco-microbiota present in the added starter culture and raw milk specific microbes, such as Galacotomyces, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Pichia kudriavzevii and Staphylococcus sciuri were detected in end products implicating their contribution in the fermentation process. No differences were observed in bacterial genomic DNA content between PMK or RMK for both style kefir beverages. Higher relative amounts of mycobiotal spike-in were found in both styles of RMK compared to PMK, implicating lower concentrations of fungi in RMK.
Conclusion:
This study indicates that the majority of microbial species found in RMK and PMK are similar albeit in different proportions. Furthermore there appears to be a higher amount of fungi present in PMK. These findings could have implications regarding the observed beneficial health effect of RMK consumption, but future studies are required to determine the exact molecular immunological mechanism."

Anisotropic deformation on contact three-manifolds,"['Cristinelli, Giacomo Cristinelli']","['Pino Gomez, A. del']",2022-04-13T00:00:56Z,EN,['Contact geometry; subRiemannian geometry; Reeb dynamics;'],Mathematical Sciences,"Anisotropic deformation, sometimes generically called adiabatic deformation, is a metric blow-up that is natural to construct on contact manifolds. Such manifolds admit a Riemannian metric which is adapted to the contact distribution in the following sense: the metric $g$ consists of a horizontal part $g_h$, that comes from a subRiemannian structure on the tangent distribution, and another one $g_v$ on the vertical direction. The deformation then rescales the metric by a factor of $1/\epsilon^2$ on the vertical component. Every variation of the value of $\epsilon$, especially in the limit $\epsilon\to 0$, massively affects almost every metric-dependent attribute of the manifold. Gromov proved that the induced metric space converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense to the subRiemannian one.
This thesis is a collection of recent results and possible future developments in the study of anisotropic limits. It starts with a description of some geometrical features of the anisotropic limit, namely the convergence of some Riemannian geodesics to Reeb orbits through  \textit{spiraling} subRiemannian geodesics. Then the discussion continues with the study of the perturbation of some Laplace and Dirac-type operators. The purpose is to analyze the convergence of such operators in the resolvent sense."

To overcome these limitations, strategies to augment the overall osteoinductivity of synthetic bone grafts have been developed. Among them, strategies aiming to promote bone regeneration through the immune system have reached the forefront of bone regeneration. In fact, immune cells can promote the local release of soluble factors that recruit bone precursor cells and promote their differentiation towards osteoblasts. Recently, a new biphasic calcium phosphate with sub-micron needle-shaped surface topography (BCP<µm) has been developed at Kuros Biosciences capable of promoting macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype, which has been associated with augmented bone regeneration. A new formulation has been developed consisting of BCP<µm granules embedded in a hydratable collagen matrix (BCP<µm-Collagen). Since the exposure of the needles is key to BCP<µm granules bioactivity, in this study we investigated whether the collage matrix hinders granules’ function. The Alamar blue assay on hMSCs cultured on the surface of the BCP<µm discs or BCP<µm-Collagen for 24 hours showed up to 20-fold increase in cell metabolic activity. Moreover, ALP and DNA quantification after 10 days of stimulation with OM showed up to 2-fold increase in ALP production per cell. These results suggest that collagen substantially favours cell attachment and metabolic activity within the first 24 hours of hMSC culture. Moreover, an increase in osteogenic differentiation towards osteoblast was reported in BCP<µm-Collagen. Hence, the addition of Collagen to BCP<µm granules does not hinder Granules’ function and BCP<µm-Collagen represents a promising bone filler with osteostimulating properties.  
PART 2: Blood vessels serve as a structure around which bone regeneration occurs, and newly formed blood vessels promote the local accumulation of soluble factors that promote the recruitment and differentiation of bone precursor cells towards osteoblasts. Elastin is a key component of elastic fibers, and in vitro tests showed that elastin promotes the migration and differentiation of HUVECs, which are the most employed cell types to study angiogenesis. To discover whether the addition of elastin to collagen matrices augments their pro-angiogenic properties resulting in more predictable bone regeneration, we cultured HUVECs for 16 hours on the surface of reconstituted collagen or collagen-elastin sponges to assess whether elastin positively regulated network formation. Then, an Alamar blue assay was performed on HUVECs cultured directly onto the surface of the lyophilized sponges to assess whether elastin promotes a higher metabolic activity in HUVECs. The network analysis revealed an increase in the number of junctions, total length, and total branching length when HUVECs were cultured in the presence of elastin compared to pure collagen gels. In particular, a 100% increase in the number of junctions, a 40% increase in total length, and an 82% increase in total branching length were observed in the presence of elastin. Finally, the metabolic assays revealed a 2-fold increase in reduction capability when HUVECs were cultured on the surface of collagen-elastin sponges compared to pure collagen sponges. In conclusion, elastin positively regulates network formation and metabolic activity in HUVECs, hence it represents a promising candidate to confer angiogenic properties to bone implants aiming to augment their overall osteoinductivity."

Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is a malaria control measure implemented in children aged between three and 59 months old, in countries of the Sahel region in Africa, which are characterised by highly seasonal transmission. A combination of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine (SP+AQ) is used monthly during four consecutive rounds. Clinical trials have shown suitable evidence on the efficacy of SMC.
This review aims to provide an overview of the effectiveness and pitfalls of SMC, focusing on SP+AQ, and explore potential SMC drug combination alternatives. For this purpose, three databases were used. Articles were identified and selected through a screening process with inclusion and exclusion criteria, based on the PRISMA statement. Data were extracted from each full text article included in the review. Parameters included were malaria prevalence, incidence, mortality, anaemia status, and gametocytaemia, depending on the measurements and outcomes of each study. Details on adverse reactions and resistance markers were also collected. A final total of 31 articles were included in the review.
SP+AQ conferred a protective efficacy against clinical malaria ranging from around 60% to 85% over 28 days, in five- to 59-month-olds. The drug combination was found to be well tolerated with low number of serious adverse effects, and vomiting was the most commonly reported reaction identified in this review. The presence of P. falciparum resistant genes (Pfmdr1, Pfdhps and Pfdhfr) was generally low throughout all studies. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA+PQ), which is already approved for treatment of uncomplicated malaria, was the second most studied drug combination. It conferred a protective efficacy against clinical malaria cases of 74% within 4 weeks post drug administration. It was also well tolerated, with no serious adverse effects reported, and the frequency of resistance genes was lower compared to that of SP+AQ.
Overall, SP+AQ is a drug combination that is effective at reducing malaria prevalence and incidence in children under five years of age, in areas of seasonal malaria transmission. It is however important to maintain efficient surveillance systems to continuously monitor the presence of resistance and drug safety. Extending SMC implementation to include older children and more numbers of rounds proved to be beneficial based on various trials. In areas where SP+AQ might not be suitable due to development of resistance, DHA+PQ appears to be an appropriate alternative. Additional studies would be valuable to further assess DHA+PQ’s efficacy and coverage when implemented at a larger scale, in order to evaluate its potential usage for SMC."

We elaborate on specific means for measuring emotions in readers of NLG output texts, and related issues. We discuss various measuring systems and design an experiment to compare a recent proposal named the Geneva Emotion Wheel (GEW) against a well-known, more established method called the Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). We compare the two methods’ test-retest reliability and find similar results for the former and a slight bias in favor of PANAS for the later. However due to sample size issues we cannot conclusively say which method performs better, objectively."

A solution to this problem is the Random Vector Functional Link network (RVFL-net), in which the input is combined randomly into a given number of 'enhancement nodes'. Given that these enhancement nodes are random combinations, one might expect that meaningless combinations will be among them. Therefore, this project is aimed at finding out whether it is useful to apply feature selection to the RVFL-net. To this end, 8 different feature selection methods are implemented and their performance is compared to that of an RVFL-net without any feature selection applied and to that of a 'regular' neural network, using a set of 22 datasets. It is found that for most datasets, applying feature selection leads to worse results than when no feature selection is applied, while for some datasets, there is a clear improvement in performance to be gained by applying feature selection. A general conclusion can thus not be drawn. Furthermore, an investigation into which feature selection method is useful in what situation is started. Here, too, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn, but some interesting patterns are found."

The self-reported motivation for secondary school computer science of Dutch 11th & 12th grade preuniversity male and female secondary school students was measured and compared using the learning section of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). This questionnaire encompasses intrinsic & extrinsic goal orientation, self-efficacy, task value, test anxiety and control of learning. In the qualitative part, semi-structured focus group interviews were conducted with four groups of students, differentiated on gender and intention to pursue a study in computer science. The quantitative results show that female students report a significantly higher task value for secondary school computer science compared to male students. The other constructs in the MSLQ did not show any statistically significant gender differences. The focus group interviews revealed that stereotypes of people in the field of computer science to be the most reported deterrent among the factors which lead to the lower representation of women in computer science. This was the case in all four focus groups, indicating that stereotyping is present in both male and female students and does not depend on whether the students are actually planning to pursue a career in computer science."

Since nature exposure has been found to be beneficial for psychological weoll-being, we hypothesize that students’ negative and positive affect as well as subjective stress improve after walking through nature for 30 minutes and that neurotic individuals’ psychological well-being benefits less from the nature exposure than low neuroticism individuals’. In this randomized, pre-test, post-test study, neuroticism was assessed with the EPI, categorized in low/high groups; positive affect, negative affect measured with the PANAS and stress perception with the SNRS-11, before and after the nature walk. A t-test was conducted to test whether a difference between baseline affect and stress scores and the corresponding after the walk scores existed; a correlation analysis to measure the associations between the baseline levels of affect, stress and neuroticism and lastly, a multiple regression with moderation analysis was computed to assess whether the relationship between nature exposure and negative and positive affect as well as stress is dependent upon neuroticism, while controlling for weather and gender. In congruence with the expectations, nature exposure improved negative affect and stress, but the more positive mood HNP experienced during the nature walk, the less they benefitted from it in terms of positive affect."
Synthesis of Chitosan:UiO-67 Beads and Preliminary Catalytic Testing using Methanol Conversion,"[""O'Beirn, Naoise""]","['Meirer, Florian']",2022-05-10T00:00:39Z,EN,[],Nanomaterials Science,"Composites of chitosan (CS), an abundant biopolymer derived from the exoskeletons of crustaceans, and UiO-67, a metal organic framework (MOF) which exhibits high chemical and thermal stability, were drop-casted in different ratios using an acetic acid solution in an attempt to produce stable beads which may be used for useful applications such as catalysis. The CS, MOF, and composite beads were characterised using ATR-IR spectroscopy, XRD, SEM-EDX, and N2 physisorption. CO-IR was used to identify the presence of catalytic acid sites on the MOF while TGA was used to study the thermal properties of the MOF, CS and composite beads. The results of these characterisations indicated that bead drop-casting using the acetic acid solution was degrading the MOF structure. Stability tests in acetic acid were conducted to study the effects of acetic acid on the MOF structure. Methanol (MeOH) conversion was chosen as a test reaction which was carried out on the pure MOF and CS:MOF beads to study the catalytic acid sites of the MOF and how they are affected when combined with CS in a bead. MeOH conversion is also an environmentally relevant process since MeOH can be converted into dimethyl ether (DME) which can be used as an alternative fuel source to conventional liquid petroleum gases. Mechanical degradation was seen when preparing the MOF for catalysis. MeOH conversion was observed in the MOF and a 1:4 CS:MOF ratio bead. Two unknown products were formed during MeOH conversion most likely as a consequence of the MOF being degraded by the acetic acid solution in drop-casting. Further in-situ data of these products and the effects of catalysis are needed, however."

A Master Thesis investigating the mediation of interlingual translation between the two cultural constellations of English and Dutch in popular picture books","['Kuijpers, Ellis']","['Besamusca-Douwes, Emmeline']",2022-05-06T23:00:32Z,EN,"[""Translation; Picture Books; Children's literature; Culture; Intercultural Communication; Interlingual Translation; Visual Translation; English; Dutch""]",Interculturele communicatie,"This thesis investigated how translation mediates between two cultural constellations in popular picture books. Picture books are books written for the youngest generation of children which include illustrations and have the purposes to entertain, to create meaning by giving names to things, and to educate children about the world around them including cultures, people, customs and behaviours. The main research question of this thesis research was: How does textual and visual translation mediate between the cultural constellations of English and Dutch in popular picture books published in Great Britain and the Netherlands? Previous research into the translation of picture books in combination with the factor of culture has shown to be scarce. This, together with the fact that mediating between cultures in translation can take on many different forms and can have different effects on the young and vulnerable target audience, implies the need to investigate the cultural translations of picture books. By adopting House’s Translation Quality Assessment (2015), the source texts (STs), illustrations and translations (TTs) of ten popular picture books that were originally published in Great Britain and were later translated for a Dutch audience were analysed to find out how textual and visual translation mediates between the cultural constellations of Dutch and English. Results showed two types of differences in textual translation between the two cultural constellations, revealing very few explicitly culturally motivated differences between the STs and the TTs, but more differences concerning linguistic style conventions. Regarding visual translation, all illustrations were identical in the STs and TTs and the text-image relationships remained unchanged from ST to TT. The few findings related to cultural differences probably resulted from the fact that the themes of the books were universal and cultural-unspecific. Therefore, suggestions for future research are to further explore popular picture books in translation to see whether they mostly have cultural-unspecific themes and to find out whether this is a reason why they are translated more easily (and possibly more often) than cultural-specific picture books. Furthermore, the method of analysis was found to be a limitation in this research, which led to the suggestion to take the same corpus and/or cultural constellations but adopt another methodological approach, to see if other methods would gather the same results."
Harmful Help?: A Critical Discourse Analysis of the mHealth App VOS to Join the Current Debate Regarding the Use and Regulations of Mental Health Apps,"['Kovářová, Klaudie']","['Vries, Imar de']",2022-05-07T00:00:27Z,EN,['Mobile Health (mHealth); Mental Health; Mobile App Regulations; Neoliberalism; Critical Discourse Analysis; Laypeople; Consumer Safety; VOS Health'],New Media and Digital Culture,"The digital neoliberal era of the 21st century is characterised by individualised users who may navigate through the free market and select their personalised online path. Every smartphone owner may download freely countless mobile applications that provide them with immediate access to desired services or information. As it is not challenging to “sell health”, numerous medical apps are available on the market today, including mental mHealth applications. This study questions the current regulatory policy regarding these apps, highlighting that even developers with no psychological expertise may freely publish them. In turn, consumers with no previous mental health care experience may download them. This thesis focuses on a specific attempt to revise the current regulations proposed by Matthews et al. and elaborates on it with further improvements and suggestions, mainly directed at the safety of laypeople.
To investigate if there is space for such revision, the study conducts an appropriated version of critical discourse analysis (CDA) of the mental mHealth app VOS. Assuming that the guidelines are already reconsidered, the case study is explored through the textual and discursive layers. It focuses on the app’s functionality, use of language, accessibility, accuracy, marketability, production, and consumption. The main findings argue that the revised guidelines require the app to be based on accepted mental health care theories and methods and designed in collaboration with mental health specialists. Moreover, the app must employ specific language that does not blur the line between mental well-being and medical help and provide an accessible and simple design that anyone may navigate through. The revised regulations enable instant use for laypeople who do not have a psychologist to guide them for financial or social reasons. Such regulations imply the consensus that mental health should not be considered a personal commodity but a human right."

One of these apps, Mindler, is gaining popularity in the Netherlands as it promises individuals a quicker and more effective route to professional help. Mindler’s approach of allowing users to choose their own therapist, and book a session for whenever it suits the individual, is carried out in the completely digital environment of their app. This digitisation raises questions on how these digital online therapy apps might reflect, reinforce and shift social structures and understandings about mental healthcare. Building on the notion that within digital technologies are embedded cultural values and ideologies, this thesis explores the way Mindler’s interface and affordances might add to existing understandings and ideologies about health, by systematically analysing the app by using the walkthrough method. In doing this, this thesis focuses on how technical elements reinforce the ideology of digital healthism, which renders the user individually responsible for maintaining or going after “good” mental health. As this approach combines perspectives from new media studies and critical digital health studies, this thesis acts as an example of how scholars from these fields can incorporate theory and methodology from the other field, in order to add more depth and substantiation to their research on digital health technologies. This thesis claims that despite allowing for more accessible mental healthcare, Mindler reinforces digital healthism through its app reflecting the same neoliberal rationality as seems to have caused the defects in traditional therapy to which these digital therapy apps claim to be an alternative."

agenda. Hoe sterker de wereld globaliseert en hoe cultureel diverser de Nederlandse samenleving
wordt, hoe meer er gezocht wordt naar een identiteit die het nationale onderscheidt van het globale
(’t Hart, 2017; De Hart & Versantvoort, 2019). Naarmate de aandacht voor het nationale groeit gaat
de regio zich ook proberen te onderscheiden (’t Hart, 2017; De Hart, 2019; Vermeij & Schyns, 2019;
Tiemeijer, 2021). Desondanks krijgt de regio opvallend weinig ruimte in het identiteitsdebat.
Onderhavig onderzoek geeft de regio zijn welverdiende aandacht door op basis van straatinterviews
en focusgroepen de constructie van de Bossche identiteit in kaart te brengen. Hiermee wordt
tegelijkertijd de toepasbaarheid van algemene theorieën over (nationale) identiteitsconstructie getest
in een regionale context. Onderhavig onderzoek legt de focus op jongvolwassen respondenten omdat
zij opgegroeid zijn in een periode waarin regionale identiteit weer terrein heeft gewonnen (’t Hart,
2017). Bovendien hebben zij enkel de geglobaliseerde wereld als referentiekader en kunnen zij
daardoor reflecteren op hedendaagse identiteitsconstructie zonder deze met vroeger te vergelijken
(De Vries & Hoffman, 2016).

Uit onderhavig onderzoek is gebleken dat de respondenten liever niet spreken over dé Bossche
identiteit, al beschrijven ze de Bosschenaren wel als een heterogeen collectief waar zij deel van
uitmaken. Wat dit heterogeen collectief, ofwel deze ingroup, verbindt wordt enerzijds gerelateerd aan
karakteriseringen en anderzijds aan verdichtingssymbolen. Dit komt overeen met de factoren die de
literatuur beschrijft in relatie tot (nationale) identiteitsconstructie. Het feit dat de uitkomsten van het
onderzoek veelal overeenkomen met de literatuur is opvallend aangezien het merendeel van de
literatuur spreekt over identiteit en identiteitsconstructie in algemene of nationale zin. Deze
vaststelling roept nieuwe, interessante vragen op die verder onderzoek behoeven. Als laatste
impliceren de uitkomsten van het onderzoek dat regionale identiteit sterker aanwezig is bij de
jongvolwassen respondenten dan hun nationale identiteit. In het nationale identiteitsdebat is een
prominente plek voor de regio dan ook niet misstaand.

De resultaten van het onderzoek behoeven echter een kanttekening aangezien de
respondenten geworven zijn uit het eigen netwerk. Het feit dat de respondenten uit een veelal zelfde
hoek van de populatie kwamen vraagt om een zorgvuldige blik op de data en het bewustzijn dat de
data niet te generaliseren is voor alle Bosschenaren. Toekomstig onderzoek zou kunnen voortbouwen
op de notie dat algemene theorieën over (nationale) identiteitsconstructie zich staande houden in
kleinere contexten en ditzelfde fenomeen testen in nog kleinere contexten, zoals bijvoorbeeld de

Environmental ethics in video games: How video games Equilinox and Everything embody the transition from an anthropocentric to an ecological worldview,"['As, Jop van']","['Raessens, J.F.F.']",2022-05-07T00:00:30Z,EN,['Environmental ethics; Videogames; Anthropocentrism; Green Media'],New Media and Digital Culture,"The climate crisis is an increasing problem, and in 2021 the Dutch government promised 35 billion euros over the next ten years to fight it. To, at least partly, solve the climate crisis, scholars argue that humans need to abandon an anthropocentric worldview where humans dominate the natural world. A good place to make people adopt, or at least make them think about, new ways of seeing the relationship between humans and non-humans is through mainstream media since it is the primary site for constructing meanings about the environment. A medium that could especially help the rhetoric of green media is that of video games. Video games can contribute to an understanding of and instruction in ecological issues and in shaping environmental or ecological awareness as they are active (the player must actively do things) and interactive (once the player has made choices, the game is now developed in a way that sets certain parameters that affect future gameplay). In this thesis the games Equilinox and Everything are analysed to understand how they represent the transition from an anthropocentric to an ecological worldview. Using utilitarian environmental ethics and deep ecology and Flanagan and Nissenbaum’s model for values in games the two games were systematically researched. This thesis found that the transition from anthropocentric to ecological is not a monotonous transition, but that it can be represented in different ways. Resulting from this research are two of those forms, an active way where players create nature to understand the interconnectedness of different species and their environment, and a passive way where players explore nature to understand the interconnectedness. Concludingly, one cannot speak of the transition from anthropocentric to ecological since this transition can take different shapes or forms."
Diffusion and diffusion-like effects of energy in lanthanide-doped nanocrystals,"['Moesbergen, René']","['Filion, L.C.']",2022-05-10T00:00:32Z,EN,[],Nanomaterials Science,"For quite some time, people have tried to fundamentally understand the processes in lanthanide-doped
nanocrystals (NCs). In these materials, the ionic dopants absorb and emit photons, where the emitted
photons have a different energy from the absorbed ones. This is possible due to energy transfer (ET)
processes, where (a part of) the energy is transferred from one ion to another. And in order to understand
the resulting emitted light, it is of importance to understand these microscopic processes. One of these
ET processes is the transfer of all its energy to a neighbouring ion, resulting in an effective diffusion of
energy.
In this thesis we study this diffusion and other diffusion-like effects in a thin film of NaYF4:Er3+Yb3+ NCs,
for which we used simulations, differential equations and experiments. First, we performed Monte Carlo
simulations in order to connect the ET rate to an effective diffusion coefficient. From these simulations,
we found that the diffusion has a transitioning point with respect to the doping concentration, at lower
concentrations the diffusion is isotropic and at higher concentrations the diffusion is anisotropic.
Secondly we solved the differential equations for two- and three-level energy diagrams in both space
and time in order to connect this diffusion coefficient to an experiment. Here we looked at the spatial
distribution of the energy, which broadens due to the effective diffusion. Upon solving these equations,
however, we found that are also other processes, that are not diffusion, that can lead to broadening and
even narrowing of this energy distribution, which is possible due to non-linear behaviour.
To test these results, we performed experiments on tuned NCs, such that we can measure these effects
independently. For this we used an experimental setup with a pulsed laser that allows us to measure the
spatial intensity distribution of the emitted light. This intensity distribution is linearly dependant on
the energy distribution and as such we can compare these experiments directly with the results of the
differential equations. So first, we measured NCs, solely doped with Yb-ions, and found that there was no
diffusion, but there was a broadening effect during the excitation. Next, we measured NCs solely doped
with Er-ions and doped with both Er and Yb, where we saw the narrowing effect due to cross-relaxation
and the broadening effect due to upconversion. Here, we were able to match all those experiments,
without a diffusion term."

By answering questions such as: what are the various reasons that have led the Netherlands to initiate a process of returning its colonial collections? What is the role of the government in the return of these objects? To what extent is Suriname affected by these returns, and what does the return of the objects imply for its community? What is the reception of these objects by Surinamese institutions? Does the return of colonial objects repair the colonial past between Suriname and the Netherlands? 

The thesis proposes to understand a much deeper problem that connects different parts of a social, political, and institutional triangle in an attempt to make visible the hidden points of these dynamics when returning the pieces. In the social sphere, the current demands that society has been making on museums are raised, questioning their coloniality and the much-needed multivocality in their narratives to recognize the colonial past. It also questions the responsibilities of governments and new policies in the political sphere. Finally, at the institutional level, the work seeks to see the contributions and dispositions of museums on both sides of the pond within their organizations, in which the voice of the interviewees is fundamental to understanding this complex structure."

How bioturbating lugworms and stabilizing seagrasses shape the morphology of a Wadden Sea tidal basin.,"['Vaassen, Sanne']","['Kleinhans, Maarten']",2022-03-24T09:00:43Z,EN,['ecosystem engineers; biogeomorphology; tidal basin; Wadden Sea; channels; tidal flat; erosion; deposition; biostabilising; bioturbating; lugworm; seagrasses; Delft 3D; Matlab model; vegetation model; benthos model; feedbacks; scale dependant feedbacks; modelling; morphology; sediment dynamics; sediments;'],Marine Sciences,"Ecosystem engineering species are mostly known for their ability to affect abiotic conditions and change the morphology of their habitat. Most often to improve habitat suitability for the species itself. Within the Wadden Sea a bioturbating lugworm digs burrows into the tidal flat bed where it feeds on the nutrients which these soils contain. The bioturbating activities of the lugworm facilitate the erosion of mud and fine sediments from the mudflat. Biostabilisers, like seagrasses, facilitate the deposition of mud in their canopy, since these species locally reduce flow velocities. The lugworm and seagrasses compete over space as they both find their suitable habitat in the intertidal range of the tidal flat, where low-energy conditions are prominent and mud concentrations are above 5\%. 

Extensive research has already been conducted into how these species interact with the abiotic environment and in what ways they affect sediment dynamics and morphology. Most of these studies are carried out on the scale of single mudflats or within flume experiments. However, studies have shown that these species also affect the environment on a larger scale (estuaries and tidal basins). To be able to understand the mechanisms behind these large-scale effects further research is required. Furthermore, there is still a lack of understanding on how the interactions between ecosystem engineers affect morphology on such scales. The objective of this research is to identify what the combined effect of the stabilising seagrasses and the bioturbating lugworm is on the morphology of tidal basins in the Dutch Wadden Sea.  

To tackle this objective and answer the main research question, the hydrodynamic FLOW module of Delft 3D is coupled to a species model (MATLAB). The study is carried out in a model domain inspired by one of the smaller tidal basins near the outlet of the Ems river in the Northeastern part of the Dutch Wadden Sea. The species model establishes the suitable areas in the model domain for lugworm and seagrass settlement, and accounts for competition between the two species. The species are parameterised to change certain physical conditions on the locations of settlement. The lugworm lowers the critical bed shear stress for the erosion of mud and increases the erosion parameter, whereas the seagrasses locally increases the drag coefficient. These changes are fed into the Delft 3D environment which computes sediment dynamics and basin morphology. A coupling between the Delft 3D environment and the species model is repeated every morphological month, which represents one tidal cycle. The scenarios with only lugworms, only seagrasses or both species with competition accounted for are compared to each other and to the control scenario without ecosystem engineers. 


The results of the model scenarios show how the lugworm erodes the higher elevations of the tidal flats. Generally, the bioturbating activities result in a decrease of mean mud fraction in the tidal basin. Seagrasses, on the other hand, locally increase bed elevations and mud fraction. However, scale-dependant feedbacks result in an increase in flow velocity around the seagrass fields. This results in the fixation and incision of tidal channels. The stabilising activities of the seagrass show a positive feedback on habitat suitability for this species, whereas eco-engineering activities of lugworms have a negative impact on their habitat. When competition is considered, the lugworm colonises a significantly larger area of the tidal basin than the seagrasses. Where the latter are restricted to the lower intertidal zones. The sediment eroded from the higher elevations where bioturbation occurs, are captured in the canopy of the seagrasses which settle on the lower elevations. Promoting incision and erosion of the tidal channels."

This project follows previous research about the pentose catabolic pathway (PCP) in Aspergillus niger, which is responsible for the conversion of D-xylose and L-arabinose. To date, most of the enzymes involved in this pathway have been identified. However, the understanding of L-xylulose conversion is still incomplete.

Among them, NRRL3_09880 showed a similar pattern in the transcriptome data as LxrA, and were closer to LxrB on the phylogenetic tree, which indicates its potential in this complex mechanism of the fungal metabolic pathway. Furthermore, six of the candidate genes, NRRL3_00094, NRRL3_07289, NRRL3_07921, NRRL3_09880, NRRL3_09881, NRRL3_11712, were successfully cloned into pET28 a (+). The recombinant plasmids were then transformed into Escherichia coli expression strains: Arctic Express and BL21 Star to proceed heterologous protein production. Based on the results of the small-scale production, proteins were produced in the soluble form. Moreover, the initial enzyme activity assays showed the possibility of NAD dependence in the reaction of xylitol conversion, instead of NADP, which is required in all known Lxr catalyzed reactions in other filamentous fungi. This finding can respond to the assumption of the existence of NADH-dependent L-xylulose reductases in previous research. However, in big-scale protein production, the amount and concentration of proteins were an obstacle to gaining further characterization of potential enzymes. To improve this problem, multiple adjustments are recommended in further experiments of heterologous expression. For example, a softer induction with lactose as the inducer and a mixed feed system with lactose and glycerol. By understanding much more about the unknown L-xylulose reductases, advanced applications can be made within the cell factory and assist the manufacture of bio-based products."
"Kan jij het raadsel van Trijntje oplossen?
Een mysterie over jagers en verzamelaars voor bovenbouwklassen in het voortgezet onderwijs.","['Remmerswaal, Annabelle']","['Tuithof, Hanneke']",2022-03-26T01:00:55Z,NL,['Mysterie; Trijntje; jagers en verzamelaars; ontwerponderzoek; verschillende perspectieven'],Geschiedenis: educatie en communicatie,"Deze scriptie is een verslag van een ontwerponderzoek. De hoofdpersoon van dit onderzoek is Trijntje, een vrouw die leefde in de tijd van de jagers en verzamelaars. Over de jagers en verzamelaars is weinig bekend en de beschikbare kennis is vanuit meerdere perspectieven te bekijken. Zo betogen sommige onderzoekers dat de huidskleur van jagers en verzamelaars donkerder is dan altijd werd aangenomen en lijkt de rol van de vrouw in de groep anders dan eerder werd gedacht. In dit onderzoek staan de verschillende perspectieven op de huidskleur van jagers- verzamelaars en de rol van de vrouw centraal. Het doel van dit onderzoek is om een opdracht te ontwikkelen voor een geschiedenisles in bovenbouwklassen havo en vwo, waarbij deze verschillende perspectieven worden behandeld.
Eerst is onderzocht welke perspectieven er bestaan op de huidskleur van jagers-verzamelaars en de rol van de vrouw, en welke middelen kunnen worden ingezet om deze perspectieven te behandelen. Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat een mysterie waarin multiperspectiviteit verworven kan worden, daarvoor geschikt is. Multiperspectiviteit wordt in dit onderzoek omschreven als verschillende, tegenovergestelde, perspectieven op een historische gebeurtenis of ontwikkeling. Van daaruit is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld die luidt: Aan welke kenmerken moet een mysterie voor havo- en vwo-bovenbouwklassen voldoen waarmee multiperspectivistische kennis ontwikkeld wordt met behulp van bronnen over de tijdperiode van jagers en verzamelaars?
Na het opstellen van ontwerpcriteria, door het bestuderen van wetenschappelijke literatuur en het raadplegen van experts en docenten, is een mysterie gemaakt. Deze opdracht is geëvalueerd in twee havo 4-klassen en drie inhoudelijk experts hebben feedback gegeven. Daarnaast is aan vier docenten feedback gevraagd. Uit de resultaten van deze evaluaties bleek dat het mysterie uit te voeren is in een klaslokaal en dat de leerdoelen worden behaald.
Geconcludeerd kan worden dat de ontwerpcriteria van dit onderzoek, bijvoorbeeld een goede nabespreking, de kenmerken zijn voor een mysterie waarin multiperspectivistische kennis over jagers en verzamelaars wordt ontwikkeld. Daarnaast is vast te stellen dat een mysterie naast deze kenmerken ook moet voldoen aan de kenmerken die specifiek gelden voor de jagers en verzamelaars. Het specifieke en inhoudelijke kenmerk is, volgens dit onderzoek, om de verschillende en kritische theorieën en meningen te behandelen. Het andere specifiek inhoudelijke kenmerk is om een correct en positiever beeld van de jagers en verzamelaars te benoemen.
Tot slot is een definitieve versie van het mysterie over Trijntje ontwikkeld waarin de verschillende perspectieven over de jagers en verzamelaars naar voren komen. Deze opdracht is een toevoeging aan bestaand materiaal over de jagers en verzamelaars in het onderwijs. Tevens draagt de opdracht bij aan het klassikaal behandelen van onderwerpen zoals verschillende huidskleuren en de positie van de vrouw in de maatschappij."
Innovative Leather Alternatives: A Short-Lived Trend or the Future of Fashion?,"['Spinnewijn, Otger']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-03-30T08:00:23Z,EN,['plant-based leather; mycelium-based leather; bacterial cellulose; tissue-engineered\nleather; sustainable fashion'],Biofabrication,"Climate change is one of the primary problems that the world currently faces and the fashion industry
plays a prominent role in accelerating climate change. Within the fashion industry, the production of
leather from animal skins is a large contributor to the industry’s environmental impact. This
environmental impact needs to be reduced to meet sustainability targets. Major brands have provided
leather alternatives to customers promoted as “vegan” leather. The main resource of these vegan
leathers is plastic, which is produced from fossil fuels. These plastic-based leathers are not sustainable
either. Efforts have gone into the creation of innovative leather alternatives (ILAs). This research
investigates properties of these ILAs such as strength and flexibility to determine how well these ILAs
could replace animal or plastic leather.

Plant-based, yeast-based, lab-grown and bacterial leather are examined through a literature review.
Values in literature reveal that one yeast-based leather called Reishi™ meets the requirements of
leather for shoes. Piñatex®, a leather made from pineapple leaves, and Desserto®, a leather made from
cactus leaves, were not strong enough to be used in shoes according to requirements, but could be
used for applications in furniture.

Interviews with stakeholders in the leather industry were conducted to retrieve more information on
the qualitative side of these materials, such as their look and feel. These interviewees include two
designers, the co-founder of an ILA producing company and the head of R&D at a leather-finishing
company. All four interviewees confirmed the lower physical properties of ILAs compared to animal
leather.

Despite these lower properties, major brands have created prototype products containing yeast-based
leather. Plant-based leathers are already used to create shoes and bags. These products have received
positive reviews so far. A brief analysis shows that consumers are interested in these ILAs because of
their lower environmental impact and their cruelty-free nature. Some consumers are also willing to
pay more for these ILAs than for animal leather.

Even though these ILAs will not replace animal leather in the fashion industry soon, they provide an
alternative for conscious consumers and have the potential to grow larger once their properties are
improved."
Understanding the Ongoing Svalbard Dispute Through the Scope of the Snow Crab Issue,"['Kloppenborg, Eva']","['Oude Elferink, Alex']",2022-03-29T00:00:30Z,EN,['Svalbard Treaty; Spitsbergen; Snow Crab; UNCLOS; International Law of the Sea; ICSID; Sedentary Species; Maritime Zones; EEZ; Contnental Shelf'],Marine Sciences,"Svalbard is a Norwegian archipelago which is situated between mainland Norway and the North pole. In 1920, the Svalbard Treaty conferred Norway sovereignty over the archipelago, with certain conditions in relation to the equal access of Parties to the Treaty attached. For the last few decades, a point of contention has arisen over the scope of application of the Svalbard Treaty. When the Svalbard Treaty was drafted, sovereignty extended to the territorial sea only. With the advent of new maritime zones, such as the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and the continental shelf, the interpretation of the Svalbard Treaty was brought into question. Whether Norway has the competence to establish these new maritime zones around Svalbard, and whether the equal access regime of the Svalbard Treaty applies in those maritime zones has been the source of continuous debate between Norway and other Parties to the Treaty. A recent investment dispute over the fishery of the snow crab, which is currently pending under the ICSID Convention has brought this issue to the forefront. Through the means of a legal literature research and analysis in accordance with the VCLT, this thesis discusses the Svalbard Treaty and its area of application before delving into the snow crab case, in which its sedentary or non-sedentary nature is of importance due to the implications it has on the exploitation of oil and mineral resources in the continental shelf. The findings are that Svalbard is entitled to maritime zones beyond the territorial sea in which the Svalbard Treaty's equal access regime is applicable. Furthermore, this thesis concluded that, whilst the snow crab has now widely been considered legally sedentary as the result of a literal interpretation of the UNCLOS definition, the drafters of the Convention never intended for crabs and crustaceans to be included in the definition. Forgetting the past has unnecessarily increased tensions regarding oil and mineral resources in the area around Svalbard. Reclassifying the snow crab's status to non-sedentary would not solve the issues surrounding the Svalbard Treaty interpretation, but it would at least restore the status quo."

The effect of touch on itch- The influence of affective touch and interpersonal touch on itch relief,"['Rahangmetan, Babette']","['Dijkerman, Chris']",2022-03-25T01:00:31Z,EN,[],Neuropsychology,"Itch is caused by a variety of conditions, but for some patients effective treatment is
still lacking. Itch is processed via unmyelinated C-fibers and is influenced by counter stimuli that
rely on similar fibers. Affective touch is a pleasant touch that relies on a subgroup of C-fibers (CTafferents) and could be effective for itch relief. CT-afferents are shown to respond optimally to typical skin temperature, thus the present study investigates whether interpersonal touch has an additional relieving effect on itch.
In this study, itch was electrically induced in four touch conditions: 1) impersonal non-affective touch,
2) impersonal affective touch, 3) interpersonal non-affective touch and 4) interpersonal affective
touch. A brush was used for impersonal touch and fingers of the experimenter for interpersonal
touch, with slow strokes (3cm/s) for affective touch and fast strokes for non-affective touch (18 cm/
s). The duration of a condition was 10 minutes, with 5 itch measurements on a VAS-scale.
The results showed that affective and interpersonal touch do not have a greater relieving
effect on itch compared to non-affective and impersonal touch. In addition, no relationship between
the experienced pleasantness of touch and itch relief was found.
In conclusion, this study could not provide supporting evidence that optimal CT-afferents activation
by touch has an additional relieving effect on itch. An attention effect is proposed as alternative
explanation. In order to draw firm conclusions, further research with methodological adjustments is
needed."
The Rise of AI in Structural Biology,"['Kromdijk, Nicky']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-03-29T00:00:33Z,EN,['CASP;Structure prediction;AI;AlphaFold2;RoseTTaFold'],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"In this review, I will explore how recent protein structure prediction methods that make use of deep
learning will impact the field of structural biology. I will particularly search for purposes where these
methods can be applied and what are their current pitfalls. After an intensive literature study, it became
clear that accurate prediction algorithms are useful to solve experimental structures faster and help
divide proteins into functional domains. Structural predictions improve interpreting the molecular
processes of (unknown) proteins and therefore provide insights into diseases and how to design potential
treatments. That way, researchers can rapidly work out the structure of every protein in new and
dangerous pathogens, speeding up the process of screening for drug targets. In addition to that, the open-source nature of these prediction methods enables scientists to continue the advances to create even
more powerful software. Besides great advances, limitations of these deep learning structure prediction
methods include that the predicted models only provide one conformational state of the protein and that
no ligands are included in the model which is crucial data for inferring exact biological function and
designing new drugs. Additionally, no folding information is present for the predicted structure. We should
not state that these algorithms solved the folding problem, as they solved the prediction problem.
Although scientists should remain critical of computational predictions, these technologies are still groundbreaking and will lead to more advances in the field of structural biology."

In fact, a lot of movies and documentaries were produced, which portray all the implications that this change carries for thousands of immigrants. La Deutsche Vita, by Tania Masi y Alessandro Cassigoli (2013), and En tierra extraña, by Icíar Bollaín (2014) are the objects of the following comparative analysis. The phenomenon of migration implies a multitude of consequences: brain drain, migratory mourning, identity crisis and the confrontation and the elaboration of the culture shock. The main difference between the two groups of immigrants portrayed is the progress of the confrontation of their migratory mourning. On the one hand, the Italian migrants represented belong to a generation who emigrated voluntarily, and, after forty years, they have accustomed and adapted themselves fulfilling their journey through the culture shock. They adjusted to the German culture and to its merits and flows. On the other hand, the young Spaniards just started, unintentionally, their journey as migrants. They are portrayed in En tierra extraña as they are living their second stage of the culture shock characterized by feelings of frustration, nostalgia and irritation."
Long-term consequences of more severe COVID-19 infections in primary care,"['Koelmans, Johannes']","['Bovenschen, Niels']",2022-06-01T00:00:38Z,EN,['COVID;long-COVID;persisting symptoms; complicated respiratory tract infection;anosmia'],Geneeskunde,"Introduction During the coarse of the pandemic, it became evident that a substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients had persisting symptoms after the acute phase of the infection. Knowledge about the duration of these symptoms in non-hospitalized patients in primary care is essential for the adequacy of their treatment.
Methods Patients with a suspected COVID-19 complicated respiratory tract infection between March 1st and June 1st  were retrospectively recruited using a query in the general practitioner’s medical files. Due to the limited testing capacity at that time, patients were not aware of their COVID-19 status. The status was then determined using IgG antibody serology and only communicated with the patients after the follow-up period. Participants received a maximum of four questionnaires covering the duration of their symptoms. Data were analyzed using Kaplan Meier survival analysis and COX proportional hazard models adjusted for covariates. 
Results A total of 291 patients were analyzed. Patients with a positive serology results were on average younger, had more often acute infectious symptoms and had a history of chronic pulmonary disease or smoking less often. Kaplan Meier analysis showed a significantly higher chance of persisting anosmia and ageusia in the serology positive group for all patients and for patients with more severe symptoms. Other Kaplan Meier analyses and the cox proportional hazards models showed no differences in primary and in sensitivity analyses.
Conclusion There is no significant difference in the duration of persisting symptoms between patients with a complicated respiratory tract infection in primary care with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody negative or positive serology. Anosmia was the only exception. These results plead for a similar societal attitude towards persisting COVID-19 complaints compared to other post-infectious respiratory tract syndromes, but do not reject its existence."

Our goal is to develop an experimental and data analysis method for studying these systems.

This thesis demonstrates EC-AFM measurements in PFT-mode, with a custom electrochemical cell filled with H2SO4 electrolyte, on a normal pulse voltammetry potential-controlled gold substrate. Data analysis of the force spectroscopy shows a clear dependency of the forces on the potential. Average force curves highlight the numerical values, and force curve maps show reproducible spatially inhomogeneous potential dependence of the adhesion. Deviations in the adhesion appear at potentials that are in literature associated with sulfate and oxide adsorption."

Instead, it should be seen as one of the many (bio)political ideologies of modernity that arose globally out of the ashes of Europe’s nationalist regulation of the modern world. Accordingly, it testified to the crucial transition period to sincere modernity and, with that, a politicized sphere of nature and life that characterized the Cold War in at least Latin America.1 With this discursive biopolitical approach of the early phases of the Cuban Revolution, this thesis aims to open up a new, less isolated and more historically engaged perspective on one of the most discussed topics of Cold War historiography."
Assessing vegetation degradation using high-resolution satellites in the region of Lake Manyara,"['Hamann, Kevin']","['Jong, Steven de']",2022-06-01T00:01:05Z,EN,['vegetation degradation; remote sensing; resilience; crusting; Lake Manyara; bush encroachment'],Earth Surface and Water,"This thesis aims to assess vegetation degradation in the region of Lake
Manyara in Northern Tanzania over the years 2017 until 2021. Multiple studies
concluded that the LULC is changing around Lake Manyara over the past
years. In some cases, this is due to humans, while in other cases it is
suggested that it is due to vegetation degradation. Previous studies showed
high vegetation resilience and no signs of vegetation degradation, yet the
Maasai observed a change in vegetation. Vegetation changes are observed in
similar areas, these changes are changes from high-nutritious grasses to lownutritious grasses and bush encroachment. The assessment is done with the
high-resolution satellites, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope, with soil moisture data
from SMAP and precipitation data from CHIRPS 2.0. The indices for the
assessment are NDVI, GCC, MBI and NDWI. This thesis concluded that
precipitation and infiltration were not simultaneously, infiltration occurred
later. Vegetation did not start growing simultaneously with precipitation, but
with infiltration in the subsurface. The lack of infiltration could be due to that
crusting is affecting the vegetation in the area. Crusting results in less
infiltration and less growth of grasses, while shrubs and trees are less affected
by crusting. This result is in line with bush encroachment and is a good
indication that vegetation degradation might occur in the grassland and
savannah areas around Lake Manyara. Vegetation resilience is still high,
although vegetation does not start to grow when the precipitation starts.
Vegetation starts to grow when water infiltrates the subsurface."
Sleep Stage Assessment in Very and Extremely Preterm Infants: Exploring the Relationship Between Behavioural Classification and Quantitative EEG Features,"['Bik, Anne']","['Dudink, Jeroen']",2022-06-01T00:00:59Z,EN,[],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Identification of sleep and wake states is important for the clinical and neurophysiological assessment of infants born preterm admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). As the importance of different sleep stages on neurodevelopment and long-term prognosis is currently unravelling, there is a high demand for quantification of sleep stages. Electroencephalography (EEG), especially two-channel amplitude-integrated EEG, is a commonly used neuromonitoring tool in daily care of preterm infants due to its ease of use. The present study aims to investigate whether quantitative EEG (qEEG) features can differentiate the different stages of sleep in very and extremely preterm infants.

Three-hour behavioural sleep observations were performed for 17 very and extremely preterm infants who were born before 30 weeks of gestation, within the first three days of life. The behavioural sleep stage classification scores were acquired using an observational score validated for preterm infants <30 weeks postmenstrual age. Several qEEG features were extracted from raw signals of the two-channel (a)EEG, including burst features (proportion spontaneous activity transients, SAT%; inter-SAT percentage, ISP; and inter-SAT interval, ISI), interhemispheric synchrony (Activation Synchrony Index, ASI) and absolute and relative spectral power of the delta frequency band. Differences of these qEEG features among different sleep stages were analysed by ANOVA.

Significant differences were found in several qEEG features at different sleep stages, mostly between Active Sleep (AS) and Quiet Sleep (QS). Specifically, the SAT%, ASI and absolute delta power of AS were significantly higher than that of QS, while ISP and ISI were higher for QS than for AS. 

Several qEEG features were identified that can differentiate different sleep stages, and thus, could be beneficial to the improvement of sleep stage classification. The present study sets the foundation for the development of an automatic sleep assessment tool using EEG for the very to extremely preterm population. Ultimately, this will eventually lead to the improvement of neurodevelopmental outcome in the very to extremely preterm infants in NICUs worldwide."
"Collaborative goal-setting: stakeholders’ experiences, barriers and facilitators.","['Sangster, Vera']","['Delden, J.J.M. van']",2022-06-01T00:01:02Z,EN,[],Geneeskunde,"Background:
Goal-setting is an approach that encourages the use of self-defined goals of care in the process of 
decision-making. It is already a commonly known concept in rehabilitation and end-of life care. 
Several positive effects have been listed in previous research. At University Medical Center 
Utrecht it appears that only few doctors document goals of care in patient records. This study 
aims to identify stakeholders’ experiences with goal-setting and the barriers and facilitators to 
discussing, documenting and using goals of care in individual health care.

Methods: 
A qualitative study design was used. In-depth topic-interviews were held with 19 healthcare 
professionals (HCPs) and 7 patients.

Results: 
Although the majority of HCPs and patients share a positive attitude towards goal-setting, it 
appears hard to accomplish. This study identified that that most HCPs are not consistent in 
discussing values, preferences and goals with their patients. Many different barriers to goalsetting are identified, including the ambiguity concerning the interpretation of goals, 
organisational barriers, patient-related barriers and the uncertainty about the usefulness and 
feasibility of goal-setting in every setting or situation. Most stakeholders agree that the current 
methods of goal-setting are not adequate.

Conclusion:
Based on our findings, the formulation of purely medical goals might be useful to improve 
communication between HCPs and provide clarity to patients. However, purely medical goals 
attribute less to performing care that is person-centered. Further research is recommended to 
identify ways to overcome the barriers and to develop a strategy for meaningful goal-setting in 
different care settings."

A disbalance in the microbiota composition can lead to a variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, and cancer. Therefore, it is important to study and identify the gut microbiota. In the past, the gut bacterial microbiota was studied using culture-based techniques. However, due to suboptimal methods and protocols, many bacteria were thought to be unculturable. Currently, new efforts to optimize culture-based techniques allowed the high-throughput cultivation of various previously uncultivated gut bacteria. This approach is called culturomics. The workflow of culturomics can roughly be divided into three steps: sample collection, culture, and bacteria identification. Here, we describe the recent advances and considerations in these culturomics processes, including sampling and preservation methods, the design of culture medium, and data collection and storage. Although there are many successful efforts in culturomics, there are still various aspects that need to be explored in the future. Further optimizing the culturomics protocol could potentially lead to the isolation and identification of novel, clinically relevant, bacterial species."

Since ikaite is only stable at low temperatures, glendonites are being used as proxies for cold climate conditions. Paradoxically, glendonites have been found in hothouse periods, such as the Eocene, Paleocene, Cretaceous, and Jurassic. In addition to low temperatures, other conditions are likely also important in driving ikaite precipitation and glendonite transformation, including elevated concentrations of P and Mg, and sulphate reduction coupled to methane oxidation. Here, we further examine the processes leading to ikaite transformation based on combined microscopic and organic geochemical analyses of glendonites from a drill core spanning the Paleocene Basilika Formation on Svalbard. Thin section analyses showed multiple growth generations of calcium carbonate in the glendonites, referred to as Type 1a, Type 1b, and Type 2. Biomarker analyses showed a strong presence of oil in both glendonites and surrounding sediments. Fluid inclusions mainly characterise carbonate generations Type 1a and 1b and can be shown to contain droplets of oil. Raman spectroscopy showed the principal calcium carbonate phase of glendonites to be calcite. In this work the presence of inclusions containing oil is used to evaluate ikaite-glendonite transformation mechanisms. Two new transformation mechanisms are proposed for the formation of the inclusion-rich type 1 generations. One mechanism involves calcium carbonate crystal nucleation on oil-water interfaces, the other involves interface-coupled dissolution-precipitation of ikaite to glendonite. Further research is warranted to determine the role of fluid inclusions in widespread ikaite formation."
Random Music as Non-Random Internet Jokes,"['Verdonk, Tom']","['Kamp, Michiel']",2022-06-01T00:00:53Z,EN,['Memes; Music Memes; Ubiquitous Listening'],Applied Musicology,"Internet memes are prevalent when browsing the internet, and while the humor itself appears to be random, many aspects of memes are not. Existing research into memes already explored how memes should be defined, the community they create, and the political potential internet memes have, showing the influence memes have in modern society. However, music memes are much less studied, especially the question why certain music is used. This thesis is a deep dive into the subgenre of music memes. It theorizes criteria that music must fulfil to be useable for memes. Roughly, music memes can be put into two categories: memes that have old music and a new meme format or new music that uses an old format. To properly analyze why certain music is used for memes this thesis employs theories about ubiquitous listening, decontextualization, and participation culture. Applying these theories results in several external and internal characteristics that explain why certain musical pieces are used more for YouTube music memes than others. While the thesis analyses general music meme trends from the last five years, the specific objects of study are Crazy Frog memes and Morshu beatboxes. Most of these find their origin on YouTube but are also shared across many other media platforms. This thesis sheds some much-needed light on the specific workings of the internet meme culture, because the memes start coming and they don’t stop coming."

Development and implementation of a new method for medication monitoring of eGFR-signals in Dutch community pharmacies,"['Kuy, Cédric van der']","['Bouvy, M.L.']",2022-04-08T00:00:40Z,EN,['Clinical Rules; Medication Monitoring; Community Pharmacy'],Farmacie,"Introduction – An important aspect of optimising pharmacotherapy is correct dosing of drugs. Dose management is especially essential in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), as an earlier study showed that 10% of medication-related hospital admissions were related to renal impairment and medication errors. Individual patient characteristics are currently insufficiently used in computerized generation of medication monitoring signals (classical monitoring, CM) for people with CKD. The objective of this study was to improve efficiency and specificity of medication monitoring in renal impaired patients. To achieve this, a new method of monitoring (reassessment-oriented monitoring, ROM) was compared to CM.
Methods – ROM was implemented in three community pharmacies and consisted of two components: I. monitoring incoming renal function values (eGFR-values) of patients and II. an adapted signal list of CM. Over the period of October, November and December 2021 generated signals following both methods were collected and merged into one dataset. Possible overlaps were identified. Subsequently, all signals were assessed as ""(potentially) actionable"" or ""not actionable"". To avoid arbitrary classification, signals were classified based on eGFR-values linked to advisory texts for drugs requiring caution in case of reduced renal function. The results were then compared to the currently used system of CM.
Results – In total 10,276 unique signals were generated. 9892 and 3158 signals were generated by CM and ROM, respectively. As a result, ROM has led to a reduction in the signal load of 68.1%. Sensitivity was determined at 98.9% for CM and 100.0% for ROM. For CM a specificity of 4.6% was calculated, as for ROM specificity was determined at 91.3%.
Discussion – The introduction of ROM led to a substantial decrease in signal load. In this context it is important to note that sensitivity did not reduce, whereas specificity strongly improved from 4.6% up to more than 90%. Based on this data, ROM has added value for medication monitoring of renal function signals in Dutch community pharmacies. The level of impact does depend on several conditions, however, and further research into other aspects regarding this method of monitoring is recommended."
Resolving Oil-to-Water Channel Leakage in Bijels: On the Road to a 3D Janus Porous Material,"['Prinsen, Jelle']","['Haase, Martin']",2022-04-08T00:00:33Z,EN,"['Janus, porous, bijel, pickering, emulsion, hydrogen, fuel cell, hydrophobization, hydrophobic effect, microfluidics, STrIPS, nanostructure']",Nanomaterials Science,"Hydrogen fuel cells are essential in the transition to sustainable electricity, since the output of
renewable energy sources fluctuates over time. The conversion from chemical to electrical
energy is performed by a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). PEMFCs suffer from
lowered efficiency due to water flooding, which hinders the diffusion of the oxygen reactant at
the cathode. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) improve
the mass transport of these two chemicals. A bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel
(bijel) offers two interwoven, fully continuous pore systems of oil and water. Our goal is to
phase-selectively hydrophobize the bijel scaffold to create a Janus porous medium, which could
serve as a GDL. The hydrophobized channel network facilitates oxygen diffusion, while the
untreated pores remain hydrophilic and allow for the transport of water. Bijels are promising
candidates to become the first material to extend the asymmetric Janus character to 3
dimensions. Solvent Transfer-Induced Phase Separation (STrIPS) is used for the continuous
fabrication of bijel-based templates with sub-micron domains. The system is characterized with
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal microscopy. The present work shows that
the hydrophobic character of the particles causes any oil to leak into the water channel. The rate
of flooding depends on the oil viscosity. Consequently, the loss of phase-distinction inhibits
phase-selective hydrophobization. The removal of oil residue and surfactant from the aqueous
phase via electro-osmosis is a promising solution to circumvent the structural degradation
which impedes the fabrication of Janus bijels. The application of bijels into a Janus porous GDL
would raise the efficiency of mass transport and thereby increase the power density of hydrogen
fuel cells."
"Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase as a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders","['Koutstaal, Anne']","['Kraneveld, Aletta']",2022-04-08T00:00:38Z,EN,"[""TDO; IDO; Kynurenine pathway; Alzheimer's disease; Parkinson's disease; Huntington's disease;""]",Drug Innovation,"The kynurenine pathway is crucial for the metabolism of tryptophan in mammals. It has been suggested that a dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway plays an important role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The first and rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation is catalysed by the enzymes tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which leads to the formation of N-formylkynurenine, which in turn leads to the formation of kynurenine. Kynurenine-3-monooxygenase catalyses the synthesis of kynurenine’s neuroactive metabolites: the neurotoxic 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid and the neuroprotective kynurenic acid. There is evidence that an imbalance between these three metabolites could potentially lead to neurodegeneration, which could cause neurodegenerative diseases. Recently several studies have highlighted the therapeutic potential of the enzyme TDO. Therefore, TDO as a therapeutic target in Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease is reviewed. Inhibition of the kynurenine pathway was found to be neuroprotective in several models of Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Particularly, inhibition of TDO was found to be neuroprotective in fruit fly and mice models of these neurodegenerative diseases. It is hypothesized that inhibition of TDO is neuroprotective by restoring the balance between the neuroactive metabolites of the kynurenine pathway. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of IDO and kynurenine-3-monooxygenase is highlighted. Even though more research is needed to further validate TDO as a potential target, it shows great potential as a target for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders."
Evaluation and comparison of calibration techniques for urban mobility behaviour ABM,"['Pellegrino, Marco']","['Dastani, Mehdi']",2022-04-08T00:00:45Z,EN,[],Artificial Intelligence,"Models need to be calibrated to represent human mobility behaviour correctly. The literature identifies challenges in calibration since there are several approaches to calibration, but primarily dependent on the model purpose.
This study addresses the lack of understanding of what makes a calibration method suitable specifically for mobility behaviour ABM. A data-driven approach is used, calibrating the proof-of-concept model of the EXPANSE project. An Amsterdam case study was selected with the ODiN dataset.
An appropriate experimental calibration framework is presented, analysing model characteristics delivering an objective function and hierarchical level in the field of human mobility.
The work also compared cutting-edge parameters search optimisation algorithms. Results hinted at surrogate model-based methodologies. Their performances outperform the other solutions on both fitness and computational load aspects. In addition, a metrics-based framework of how to compare calibration techniques for human mobility ABM is presented.
Finally, the investigation also proved that a parameter dimensionality reduction method based on grouping does not bring any benefit compared to calibrating the entire parameter set.
This project is just the first step in this field. The results are valuable, not only to the transport choice field only but generic to the main idea of mode choice. The established framework will be a profitable tool for all the researchers to be used in urban developments for a sustainable and healthier future."
Speech Detection for noisy audio files,"['Hamandouche, Daniel']","['Nazarov, Aleksei']",2022-04-08T00:00:42Z,EN,['Voice Activity Detection; Wav2vec; U-net; Speech Emotion Recognition'],Artificial Intelligence,"Voice activity detection is the challenge to detect the presence or absence of speech in audio files. Different obstructions, such as noisy environments, make this challenge tougher. A noisy environment is, in that case, defined as a recording, which has a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

This thesis aims to detect speech in very noisy environments with an SNR of -10dB and lower. As current deep learning methods were not designed for these very noisy environments and, thus, do not perform well, a new model is adapted to the task. Wav2vec2.0 was created for speech recognition and uses raw audio as input. This thesis adopted and finetuned Wav2vec2.0 for speech detection and extended it by using spectrograms as a second input. The resulting model is compared to two existing speech detection models, one using an architecture based on Lenet-5 and one using a U-net-shaped architecture. All three models are tested on the QUT-NOISE-TIMIT dataset. The results show that the Wav2vec2.0 downstream model performs best on all noise levels. Wav2vec2.0 had the lowest half-total error rate for high noise with 7.71% on a signal-to-noise ratio of -10dB and 18.56% for an SNR of -15dB. All models missed at least 40% of speech for higher noise, so no model is stable.

Furthermore, a sub-question investigated whether the results are beneficial for follow-up tasks. For that, the predictions of each model were used as a pre-processing step by removing all segments without speech. 

The results show that Wav2vec2.0 not only improves speech detection for high noise environments, but this improvement also affects speech emotion recognition in these environments. Additionally, this thesis shows that self-supervised learning methods as well as using raw audio are beneficial to the task of speech detection."

Materialist subjectivity: From quantum mechanics to the space of subjectivity,"['Klein Douwel, Mon']","['Tuin, Iris van der']",2022-04-20T23:00:27Z,EN,['philosophy of quantum mechanics; quantum; quantum mechanics; philosophy; karen barad; hugh everett; philosophy of science; science; materialism; new materialism; subject; subjectivity'],History and Philosophy of Science,"How do scientists view the world around them? They see stars and galaxies, atoms and molecules, foetuses and trees. They see material things. Admittedly, scientists also talk about processes in which these things participate: they flutter and flash, they build and bend. But at the bottom of these processes are the things. These things form nature. And the scientist stands before nature to behold her.
Scientists are materialists. But what have they forgotten? And what about us, who live in a scientific world, what have we forgotten? We have forgotten that we are nature, that we are a part of what we are trying to understand, rule and exploit. Scientific inquiry is thus self-referential, it is nature-investigating-nature. Now, this is the exact character of subjectivity. And we have forgotten the subject.
The reason for our ignorance is twofold. Firstly, thanks to the amazing scientific progress of the last couple of centuries, we have become too arrogant towards Nature. Secondly, due to science’s explanatory success, we have become scared of contradiction and incompleteness. Scientists fear the self-referentiality of subjectivity, because they view it as a logical contradiction.
Hence, can we come up with a materialist theory of subjectivity? At first sight it seems impossible to faithfully account for subjectivity in a materialist framework. Therefore, our first task is to map the problematic points. From there, we can adjust our ideas of the nature of matter and the nature of subjectivity such that they become consistent. All along the way we have to preserve our respect for nature, for the accomplishments of science and for subjective first person experience.
This thesis consists of three parts. In the first, I sketch the context of the problem and review different ideas concerning the relation between subjectivity and reality. This will be the necessary foundation for a fruitful further discussion. Here I follow the ideas of Jenann Ismael, Bruno Latour and Donna Haraway.
In the second part, I discuss a materialist theory in which the subject plays an important role: quantum mechanics. We look at this theory for inspiration to reconceptualise matter. The thinkers central in this part are Nils Bohr, Karen Barad and Hugh Everett.
The third and final part is more abstract. I will turn to the genesis of the subject as a material entity and role of subject in the genesis of matter. Here, again, we encounter the indispensable self-referentiality of subjectivity and matter. The inspirations for this new model for the simultaneous genesis of matter and subject are Henri Bergson, Gilles Deleuze and Manuel DeLanda. I will connect the concept of the virtual to that of chaos, in order to speculate about a space of subjectivity which provides the canvas for reality."
The salt intrusion response of morphodynamic estuaries to changing river discharge,"['Traas, Meike']","['Nienhuis, Jaap']",2022-04-20T00:00:44Z,EN,['Estuary; Estuaries; Salt intrusion; Width response; Morphodynamics; Morphology'],Earth Surface and Water,"Salt intrusion has large consequences for estuarine environments and communities. Salinization harms the ecology and biodiversity in an estuary and it might constrain the possibilities of using water for irrigation, industry and human consumption. Due to the seasons, climate change and increasing anthropogenic influences, the river discharge might change on short or long timescales which will affect the salt intrusion and the morphology on the long term. Previous research has been done to the effect of river discharge on salt intrusion, but those use a morphostatic model with a constant width profile. In this thesis, a one-dimensional tide-averaged numerical hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model is used, which includes a variable width and a constant bed level. This model is best suitable to simulate the response of estuaries globally, and less suitable to look into details for individual estuary systems. The estuary width is calculated by an optimized empirical hydraulic geometry relation that relates the width to the river discharge and tidal peak discharge. River discharge and tides force the upstream and downstream boundaries, respectively. For the salt intrusion length, an empirical method was used after validation. On the short term, the morphology of an estuary will not change, meaning that only the hydrodynamics can affect the salt intrusion length. This results in higher salt intrusion lengths for lower river discharges, since the tide is less countered by friction with the river flow. On the long term, the estuary will narrow for smaller river discharges, which causes more friction between the tide and the banks causing a lower salt intrusion. For some estuaries, the salt intrusion length increases for river discharges above the yearly averaged discharge, since friction diminishes. River-dominated estuaries, where the river discharge is much larger than the tidal discharge, experience much more narrowing. It becomes difficult for the tide to enter the estuary causing a large reduction in salt intrusion length on the long term. River discharge has a small influence on the salt intrusion length and morphology of tide-dominated systems. Mixed systems have a large increase in salt intrusion when the river discharge decreases on both the short and the long timescale, since widening of the estuary mouth causes that the tide can still easily enter after narrowing. This 1D numerical model can be used for further research when the goal is to gain insight into the long term evolution of estuaries, for example when the effects of sea-level rise or sediment deficits are investigated."
"Understanding the influence of local government strategies targeting creative industries in Bandung, Indonesia, using Agent-Based Modelling","['Bron, Mandy']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-04-20T23:00:33Z,EN,"['Agent-Based Modelling, ABM, Creative Industries, Creative Industry, Bandung, Indonesia, Local Government Strategies']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"Creative industries are blooming in the Global-South (Fahmi, McCann, Koster, 2017) as they are potential drivers of job creation, innovation, and social inclusion (UNCTAD, 2010; Lazzeretti & Vecco, 2018). This has caused Indonesia to embrace creative industries and to implement policies focused on the development of its creative industries. These policies are often aimed at specific areas, like cities. One city that embraces creative industries is Bandung. The implementation of such policies makes it of importance to policy makers to understand to what extent the policy strategies ensure that the policy goals are achieved. Therefore, this study aims to assess the impacts of local government strategies on the development of creative industries in Bandung, Indonesia.

Three research questions were set up to guide the process: “What are the policy actions of the local government policy strategies that are used to stimulate the development of creative industries?”, “What characteristics of creative firms and their environment are of importance for the development of creative firms?”, and “What is the impact of the local government strategies on the development of creative firms?” To achieve the research aim, an agent-based model was set up and a scenario-based analysis was performed. Survey data and literature were used to set up the agent-based model. Three of the most recent and relevant local government policies aimed at creative industries in Bandung have been reviewed to set up scenarios for the analysis. This led to the baseline scenario, the industrial centres development scenario and the tourism development scenario. An average nearest neighbour analysis and a Moran’s I analysis were conducted to analyse the spatial patterns. Lastly, the number of bankrupt creative firms have been analysed.

The scenario-analysis showed that the implementation of the policy actions caused clustering of creative firms. In all scenarios, this clustering was based on their main product. The tourism scenario also showed clustering based on the customer target. In addition, the results showed that the policy actions that are directly aimed at creative firms, e.g., offer financing and workshops, impacted the development of creative firms as they caused more creative firms to establish and less creative firms to go bankrupt. The policy actions that are indirectly aimed at creative firms, e.g., establishing a festival and developing creative tourism programmes, impacted the development of creative firms as they caused more firms to go bankrupt. This research showed that the following policy actions are deemed the best for creative industry development: improving financing access, providing financial subsidies, offering training, and offering workshops. These policy actions are recommended to be included in the policy strategies aimed at the development of creative industries."

It is the task of statistical
postprocessing to use these NWP predictions to issue probabilistic forecasts that address these issues. In this work we focus on multivariate postprocessing, which also requires statistical modelling
of the spatial, temporal or inter-variable dependencies. More especifically, we use NWP forecasts
from the Harmonie-Arome model to issue multivariate probabilistic forecasts for hourly wind speed
predictions from initialization at 0 UTC up to 48h ahead. We propose a new statistical model
for multivariate forecasting, the ARMOS(p) model, that exploits the autoregressive property of
forecast errors to estimate an explicit parametric distribution, and compare it to a benchmark
obtained from a combination of Ensemble Output Statistics (EMOS) with the Schaake Shuffle.
We further extend these models by estimating the distribution parameters using neural networks,
which incorporate spatial and temporal information from the NWP forecasts by using LSTM and
Convolutional layers. In our experiments we verify model performance by computing proper multivariate scores and by performing marginal verification on the test set. The results show that the
LSTM/EMOSnet and the ARMOS(2)net improve on the benchmarks, and are the best models
overall."
Measurements and Elements of Reality in Relational Quantum Mechanics,"['Tagliani, Edoardo']","['Bacciagaluppi, Guido']",2022-04-20T00:00:33Z,EN,['Measurements; Elements of Reality; EPR; Relational Quantum Mechanics; Grete Hermann'],History and Philosophy of Science,"In Relational EPR, Rovelli and Smerlak argued that the EPR correlations do not entail any form of ‘nonlocality’ when interpreted within the framework of the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics by departing from a strict definition of realism, according to which physical systems exist ‘by themselves’ in the sense that they are characterised by an objective, absolute state of affairs in favour of an ontology of ‘sparse, relative facts’. I claim that Rovelli implicitly distinguishes between ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’ measurements: in the case of a “direct” measurement, the experimenter would not be able ascribe an element of reality to the particle but only to the reading of his apparatus, because the interaction between the particle and the measuring device would be independent from the interaction between the ‘observer’ and his device. I disagree with such a distinction and maintain that all measurements in quantum theory are always indirect measurements, in the sense that we always perform certain manipulations on a physical system to predict a value of another physical system that has previously interacted with the former. In this thesis, I analyse the implication of this claim with respect to Rovelli’s treatment of the EPR correlations and maintain that elements of reality can be retrospectively ascribed, without violating locality, to particles that have previously interacted with our measuring device by reconstructing a causal story that brought the measurement outcome about."

Unfortunately, documentation is often neglected due to a lack of interest, negatively affecting projects. Automating the process of software documentation could help in solving this problem altogether but is, as of right now, nearly impossible to achieve. This paper will introduce a software project tool selection method called SoPro-TSM that allows automatic documentation to be a part of the selection process. The idea behind SoPro-TSM is based on a concept called “tools are the message”. This concept implies that, in long-lasting software projects, everything needed for documentation could be found in the tools used within the project. This paper uses this concept to introduce a method that allows for a software project tool selection that considers the message represented within the tools. Achieving this would lead to better insight into which parts can be automated. Two literature reviews and stakeholder 
Interviews at the IT company Incentro were conducted to develop the method. The data collection results included a set of requirements and method fragments that were combined and modeled in a Process-Deliverable Diagram (PDD). After validating this PDD through several validation criteria, the concluding method could help in facilitating automated documentation."
