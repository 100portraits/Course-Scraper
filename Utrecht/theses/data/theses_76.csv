REASSESSING HAEMATOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS FOR CYNOMOLGUS MACAQUE AND RHESUS MACAQUE,"['Hage, P.S.']","['Langermans, J.A.M.']",2021-08-25T18:00:27Z,en,['Cynomolgus monkey; clinical chemistry; haematology; Rhesus monkey; Pregnancy; Housing; Age; Sex; bodyweight; Pregnancy;'],Geneeskunde van gezelschapsdieren,"Cynomolgus macaques and rhesus macaques are important for scientific studies on life-threatening diseases for humans. Nonhuman primates are the closest comparison to humans, as they are comparable in terms of genetics, anatomy, psychology and behaviour. Haematological and biochemical parameters are important parameters for pathology, toxicology and physiology studies. The Biomedical Primate Research Centre (BPRC) conducts research into life-threatening human diseases, using rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. The reference values of the haematological and biochemical parameters have previously been determined, assuming that all values were normally distributed. Currently more data is available, which gives the opportunity to check and possibly update the reference values. It is also examined whether different conditions, such as sex, age, indoor/outdoor housing, obesity and pregnancy have an influence on these values. The study collected data of 1702 rhesus and cynomolgus macaques of which a total of 4083 measurements are available. A total of 24 haematological and 22 biochemical parameters were determined. Because the values of most parameters did not show normal distribution, non-parametric methods were used to calculate differences. The animals were divided into 4 different groups: juvenile female (age under 4), juvenile male (age under 4), and adult female (age 4 years and older) and an adult male (age 4 years and older). These 4 groups were compared to analyse the effects of age and sex. For rhesus macaques, age and sex have significant effects on many of the haematological parameters. In cynomolgus macaques this was less clear, likely due to the fewer available observations. 

Analysis of all data show that sex, age, bodyweight, housing with or without outdoor access and pregnancy affect several haematological and biochemical parameters. These findings must be taken into account when screening animals for their health or in studies. This revised extensive and systematic reference values for biochemical and haematological parameters for cynomolgus and rhesus macaques at the BPRC will facilitate health monitoring and further refinements of biomedical studies employing cynomolgus and rhesus macaques as animal models."
A Machine Learning Approach for Requirements Traceability in Model-Driven Development,"['Rasiman, R.S.']","['Dalpiaz, F.', 'España, S.']",2021-08-25T18:00:19Z,en,"['Requirements Traceability, Machine Learning']",Business Informatics,"[Context & Motivation] Requirements Traceability (RT) aims to follow and describe the lifecycle of a requirement. A multitude of standards require RT practices because they provide benefits in project management, project visibility, maintenance, and verification and validation. 
[Problem] Many of these RT practices are carried out manually, which poses significant risks. Manual tracing techniques are prone to mistakes, vulnerable to changes, time-consuming, and difficult to maintain. The task of recovering traces should not be done manually but should instead be automated. However, this is an issue since existing automatic tracing tools have shortcomings, as evidenced by the low tool penetration.
[Results] We propose to tackle this problem by using machine learning (ML) techniques. This research presents the design of a tracing tool for automatically recovering traces between JIRA issues and commits in a model-driven development (MDD) context. Using process and text-based data, we created 154 features to train a ML classifier. This classifier was then validated using four real MDD industry datasets. We were able to get an average F2-sore of 73.48 with the best tested configuration, for a situation where we could recommend traces to a developer. An F0.5-score of 77.32 was obtained in the scenario of automatically maintaining traces of a current project.
[Contribution] The findings of this study demonstrate that state-of-the-art trace recovery techniques can successfully be implemented in an MDD-context, bridging the gap between academia and industry."
A Framework for Data Quality Management in the Delivery & Consultancy of CRM Platforms,"['Albrecht, R.']","['Overbeek, Sietse J.', 'van de Weerd, Inge']",2021-08-25T18:00:17Z,en,['Data quality; Management; CRM; Consultancy'],Business Informatics,"Contemporary enterprises depend heavily on data. An important operational aspect of enterprises that relies upon its utilisation of high-quality data is CRM, where poor quality of data can negatively influence its adoption. Furthermore, contemporary CRM platforms are increasingly interconnected and complex due to varying and
growing needs of customers. Hence, delivery & consultancy of such CRM platforms becomes increasingly complex as well. This research proposes a CRM data quality management framework that can assist CRM delivery & consultancy teams to improve data quality management practices within their projects and ultimately
improve data quality within CRM solutions for their clients. The main research question reads as follows: How can a data quality management framework be designed
to assist with the delivery and consultancy of CRM platforms? To answer the main research question, a literature study investigates data quality definition
and measurement in the contect of CRM, existing data quality challenges in CRM platforms and their potential solutions, and existing data quality management practices, from which best practices for the context of CRM delivery & consultancy are extracted. A case study comprising expert interviews and documentation analysis at an IT consulting company investigates CRM delivery & consultancy projects and how these can benefit from the incorporation of data quality management practices. The design of the framework is validated by means of a design theory and a questionnaire, which are discussed in confirmatory mini focus groups consisting of CRM delivery & consultancy experts. The results translate into a framework that provides a high-level overview of data quality management practices incorporated in CRM delivery & consultancy projects. It involves the recognition of variety in clients and projects by introducing the establishment of a unique data quality management plan at the start of the project. Furthermore, it includes the following components: client profiling; project definition; preparation; migration/integration; data quality definition; assessment; and improvement."
Exploratory Analysis on Linguistic Patterns of Fake and Real News Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"['Lucassen, R.E.']","['Giachanou, A.']",2021-08-25T18:00:17Z,en,"['Topic modelling, Gensim, Python, Emotion analysis, VADER, Sentiment analysis, LIWC']",Applied Data Science,"Since the first COVID-19 case, the world has been simultaneously dealing with a pandemic and the consequences of fake news shared about it. We believe that fake and real news have different linguistic characteristics. Therefore, this study explores the linguistic and semantical differences between fake and real COVID-19 news on social media. We use a dataset collected by Patwa et al. (2020) that contains real and fake social media posts. First, we use LDA topic modelling on the collection to extract topics regarding COVID-19. In total, the model found 21 topics with a high coherence score of 0.725. The number of fake and real news articles per topic shows which topics need more careful attention by the public. 

We use VADER to analyse the differences in sentiment polarity between fake and real news. The results show that fake news is statistically significantly more negative than real news overall. Additionally, specific topics (e.g., the topics “Misinformation COVID-19” and “Donald Trump”) showed more negativity within fake news than real news. Lastly, we looked at linguistic and emotional differences between real and fake news using the English LIWC dictionary. Using the Mann-Whitney test, we show that overall fake news shows statistically significantly more anger than real news. Within topics, we found further dissimilarities between fake and real news using grouped LIWC categories."
"Analysing the Social-Economic Impact of Wireless

Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis on Tweets","['Hadi, W.']","['Qahtan, Hakim']",2021-08-25T18:00:18Z,en,[],Applied Data Science,"Social media platforms can be used as a data source for measuring public opinion on various topics such as wireless mobile services. Twitter is a suitable platform that is able to map the sentiments. In this research the influence of wireless mobile services on values such as user satisfaction (social effect), affordability (economic effect) and willingness (social effect) is researched. This research is conducted through a created system that uses topic modeling and sentiment analysis. HDP, LDA and LSI are the topic models used to map the various topics. While Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Random Forest are the sentiment models that map the sentiment per value. All these models are evaluated for their performance with the aim of choosing the best model for the system. This research will also determine the sentiment over time for each value and the sentiment for the companies Mint Mobile and Infinity Mobile. These companies have different policies, the aim of this analysis will therefore be to provide insight into the effect of company policy on user satisfaction, affordability and willingness. The analysis has shown that the overall sentiment for user satisfaction, affordability and willingness is negative. This research also showed that the pandemic has played a major role in this negative sentiment. For both willingness and affordability, a clear trend break can be observed at the start of the pandemic. Finally, it is also observable that for all values , the company with a more flexible policy(Mint Mobile) has a less negative sentiment than the company (Infinity Mobile) with a traditional policy."
Early warning of incidents during protest demonstrations using Twitter,"['Wouters, J.']","['Veltkamp, Remco', 'Brinkhuis, Matthieu']",2021-08-25T18:00:19Z,en,[],Business Informatics,"While most protest demonstrations remain peaceful, some of them become violent, resulting in possibly dangerous situations. Because there is a positive correlation between social media use and protest participation, we propose to analyze incidents during protest demonstrations using social media data. In this study, a Twitter dataset is collected related to a Dutch demonstration where protesters did not comply with COVID-19 rules of the government. Following, an exploratory data analysis is performed to identify the phases of Twitter coverage after an incident during a protest demonstration. Additionally, machine learning models are trained to distinguish incident-related from non incident-related tweets. Furthermore, analysts at the Dutch national police force are interviewed to identify the information need when automatically detecting incidents during protest demonstrations. Lastly, an early warning system is created that automatically extracts tweets and detects incidents during protest demonstrations. Findings show four phases of Twitter coverage can be identified after an incident during a protest demonstration, Support Vector Machines (SVM) perform best in distinguishing incident-related from non incidentrelated tweets and analysts at the Dutch national police force want to obtain incident information as soon as possible. The developed system was able to detect incidents during a protest demonstration by using Twitter data, but could be improved."

European Medicines Agency (EMA) and retrieve European Public Assessment

context of EMA but Nutch provides capabilities for wider applications which
are also documented. The crawler was successful in gathering the correct URLs
creating a database of the target reports. The scalability of this web crawler
is apparent in terms of the Nutch capabilities however, some of the configurations
remain context specific. The extensible nature of the crawler properties,
although valuable, require extensive knowledge to implement. This paper provides
a detailed description of how to crawl EMA and provides guidance on
how this configuration can be applied to other contexts. Future research into
the range of Nutch capabilities is recommended to ensure the tool is being

De reden voor dit onderzoek komt voort uit de voorstellen van de onderwijsraad die meer clustering wil van de gammavakken en de invulling die curriculum.nu geeft aan haar leergebieden. Ook wetenschappelijk is er nog weinig onderzoek gedaan naar de vakdidactiek van deze vakken, en waar dit al wel gebeurt, gaat het vooral om de vakken geschiedenis of aardrijkskunde. Ik heb op basis van een analyse van de examenprogramma’s de keuze gemaakt voor de begrippen urbanisatie en ongelijkheid. De redenen hiervoor zijn omdat deze (1) in alle vier de vakken voorkomen en (2) bij alle vakken een redelijk gelijke algemene definitie heeft, maar inhoudelijk zijn er belangrijke nuanceverschillen. Ik heb de vakdidactische kennis omtrent deze begrippen onderzocht door content representation (CoRe) vragenlijsten af te nemen bij 25 docenten voor het begrip urbanisatie en 17 docenten voor het begrip ongelijkheid. Het grootste deel van deze docenten heeft al meer dan tien jaar ervaring in het onderwijs en hiermee al een ver ontwikkelde vakdidactische kennis.

Als belangrijkste resultaat komt uit dit onderzoek dat er een overlap zit in de vakoverstijgende doelen die de docenten zichzelf stellen als het gaat om de twee begrippen. Docenten gebruiken deze container begrippen om zicht te richten op burgerschapsdoelen en handvatten voor de leerlingen om naar hun eigen leefomgeving te kijken. 

Doordat docenten deze containerbegrippen gebruiken voor hun vakoverstijgende doelen hebben de CoRe’s helaas minder van de specifieke vakdidactische kennis aan het licht gebracht dan in eerste instantie gehoopt. Wel geeft de overlap in vakoverstijgende doelen bij deze docenten een mooi startpunt voor eventuele vakintegratie. De docenten van deze vakken hebben een gedeelde visie op de rol van onderwijs buiten hun eigen vak om en dit kan een goede basis vormen voor vakintegratie of vakoverstijgende projecten. Aan het einde van dit onderzoek doe ik een aantal aanbevelingen voor eventuele onderwerpen die deze vakoverstijgende lijn kunnen volgen en hier tevens vakinhoudelijke diepgang aan kunnen geven."
Predicting developmental age in young children by applying deep learning approaches to EEG data,"['Bruns, B.M.A.']","['Schnack, H.G.', 'Wijnen, F.N.K.', 'Huber, F.']",2021-08-26T18:00:21Z,en,"['deep learning, machine learning, time series, EEG, neuroimaging, developmental age, vocabulary, dyslexia, brain age, neuroscience, developmental psychology']",Artificial Intelligence,"EEG-based age prediction models could be suitable indicators of brain maturational levels in children (from infancy till adolescence). In the past, traditional machine learning (ML) methods have been applied for predicting the age of young children using EEG data demonstrating the general feasibility of such an approach. Using an EEG data set (N=1,368,001 EEG epochs) from an extensive longitudinal study (children aged 11 to 47 months, N=304) we adapted state-of-the- art deep learning (DL) techniques to obtain improved age predictions for young children. This included implementing suitable tools to assess the uncertainty of the DL model, as well as tools to gain further insight into the models’ decision-making process (“explainable AI”). First, using feature extraction techniques and traditional ML tools, we created a reference age prediction model. We then implemented and compared seven DL regression architectures, trained on raw EEG data. To test the hypothesis that EEG-based age estimates reflect brain maturational level, we investigated if advanced/delayed EEG-based ages correlate with expressive and receptive vocabulary size. Finally, we investigated if the models’ age estimates are predictive of the presence or absence of recorded dyslexia predisposition. The best model, the cross-validated Encoder DL model, produced a mean absolute error of 4.82 months, a root mean squared error of 5.90 months, and an R-squared of 0.674. The brain age gaps (age estimate minus chronological age) were moderately to highly stable over time (0.534 ≤ r ≤ 0.835). Depending on the model, vocabulary sizes and brain age gaps have a weak to strong positive correlation at the age of 17, 23 (only expressive), and 35 months. A significant relationship between the brain age gap estimate and dyslexia predisposition was not found. We showed that DL models can outperform traditional ML models on infant age prediction using EEG data. DL models can extract features from raw EEG data, indicating the feature extraction and selection process can be avoided. For some DL models, the brain age gaps contain information about the subject’s development (vocabulary), depending on the model and age group. We presented an outlook on DL model explainability possibilities. Based on our findings, we expect that it is possible to use DL models to find other biomarkers in EEG data as well."

The performance of the two algorithms is evaluated on the Winner Determination Problem in Multi-Combinatorial Auctions. The purpose of the study is to understand how well, the linkage tree model on which GOMEA relies, is able to capture and explain the structure of the problem and how well it performs when compared to an algorithm that’s already been proven excellent in solving the aforementioned problem as the BRKGA. 
To test the algorithms problem instances are generated using the Combinatorial Auction Test Suite (CATS). The test suite is able to generate ad hoc problem instances varying in terms of dimension, hardness, and distribution. Additional FOS models like the Univariate model, for the GOMEA algorithm, are tested and evaluated. GOMEA is also tested with the RKGA and Ordering Messy Genetic Algorithm (OMEGA) on deceptive permutations problems.
Results show that GOMEA performs well, especially on harder problem instances when compared to the BRKGA, even though the linkage tree model
doesn’t fully represent the problem structure."

Furthermore, most models require a modeler to model every interaction in a separate model. It is therefore not possible to simulate the system as a whole.

The influence of screen size and personality on the emotional response to film,"['Blok, A.F.']","['Van den Broek, E.']",2021-08-26T18:00:22Z,en,['Emotional response; screen size; personality'],Human-Computer Interaction,"Emotions guide us through our lives and are influenced by stimuli around us. How media stimuli, such as films, are presented on a device may influence the emotional response. Stimuli can be presented on various screen sizes, where on a larger screen, objects can appear closer and have a greater emotional response compared to smaller screens. An emotional response differs per the individual due to each individual’s personality that plays an important role in the emotional response. This Thesis investigates the relationship between screen size, personality, and emotional response towards film stimuli. A survey was conducted with 72 participants in natural settings that examined the emotional response towards film clips presented on three different screen size conditions, TV, laptop, and mobile. The emotional response was measured in the two emotion dimensions of valence and arousal. The results suggest that the film clips were effective in eliciting the intended emotional states and the temporal spacing between the film clips was shown to be effective in decreasing the emotional states with 20 seconds of black screen. The significant results confirmed that the experiment’s design was effective in eliciting emotional states and decreased the carryover effect between those emotional states. In addition, the results suggest that different screen size categories and personality traits, extraversion and neuroticism, have no effect on the intensity of the emotional response to film clips. The non-significant result was hypothesized to be caused by the screen resulting field of view, which was estimated to be roughly similar across the screen size conditions. The hypothesis arose that field of view might be a more determining factor than screen size for the emotional response to emotional stimuli concerning stimuli presented through a media form."

Il viaggio ispirato. Un’analisi biografica dei luoghi - e i temi collegati ad essi - ne Il pellegrino appassionato di Giuseppe Antonio Borgese,"['Speelman, R.R.D.D.']","['Cascio, dr. G.']",2021-08-27T18:00:26Z,it,['Giuseppe Antonio Borgese; Il pellegrino appassionato; cronotopo; critica letteraria biografica'],Italiaanse taal en cultuur,"A volte ce lo dimentichiamo, ma il luogo in cui si svolge una storia è un dato di primo piano. Ciò vale senz’altro per l’opera narrativa di Giuseppe Antonio Borgese (1882-1952) che nella sua carriera da giornalista viaggiò per l’Europa, visse in luoghi sparsi per tutta l’Italia e infine si esiliò negli Stati Uniti. Secondo le teorie del critico letterario Bachtin, il cronotopo, ovvero un’ideale unione delle coordinate di tempo e di spazio, in cui si svolge una trama letteraria, viene utilizzato per dare un significato a certi temi. Abbiamo dunque legato questa teoria a quella della critica letteraria biografica, che cerca di collegare gli eventi fittizi nella produzione letteraria di un autore alle vicende reali nella sua vita, le quali formano il quadro teorico di questa nostra ricerca. In questa tesi si è indagato il rapporto tra i temi legati ai luoghi nelle novelle della raccolta Il pellegrino appassionato (1933) e il ruolo che questi posti svolsero nella vita di Borgese. Dopo aver dato brevi note sulla vita e le opere dello scrittore e la presenza dei riferimenti geografici nei suoi racconti, ci siamo focalizzati sui temi legati a tre luoghi specifici, cioè Milano, Firenze e la Sicilia, che svolsero un ruolo importante sia nella vita dell’autore che ne Il pellegrino appassionato. Si è potuto concludere che esiste un legame fra i temi legati ai primi due posti, vale a dire il malessere esistenziale per la città di Milano e la gioventù per Firenze, e la vita di Borgese, che ha dovuto subire degli episodi di ostilità non all’ultimo posto nel capoluogo lombardo, e che proprio nella città del Giglio trascorse gran parte della sua giovinezza. Inoltre abbiamo potuto concludere che i temi presenti nelle novelle siciliane, cioè la rappresentazione della Sicilia, da una parte come un’isola piuttosto mitica e nostalgica e dall’altra come una regione relativamente problematica, coincidono con l’immagine presente anche nelle opere di altri autori novecenteschi di provenienza siciliana, anche se si potrebbe legare questo primo tema al sentimento nostalgico che avrà provato l’autore mentre era separato dalle sue parti native; la sua “sicilianità” è infatti ben visibile nei suoi racconti. In conclusione, si è potuto determinare che si possono, in gran parte, spiegare i temi legati ai riferimenti geografici presenti ne Il pellegrino appassionato esaminando il ruolo che essi giocarono nella vita dello scrittore e che l’uso combinato delle teorie di Bachtin e della critica letteraria biografica ha portato a risultati rilevanti.

Men dreigt het soms te vergeten, maar de plek waar een verhaal zich afspeelt is van cruciaal belang om een literair werk te kunnen duiden. Dit geldt dan ook zonder meer voor het werk van de schrijver Giuseppe Antonio Borgese (1882-1952), die gedurende zijn werk als journalist door Europa reisde, op plekken verspreid door heel Italië woonde en in ballingschap was in de Verenigde Staten. Volgens literair criticus Bachtin wordt de chronotoop (een eenheid van tijd en plaats) waarin een literair werk zich afspeelt gebruikt om uitdrukking te geven aan bepaalde thema’s. Wij hebben deze theorie verbonden aan de literaire biografische kritiek, die poogt fictieve gebeurtenissen in de werken van een auteur te linken aan werkelijke gebeurtenissen uit zijn leven, welke samen het theoretisch kader vormen van deze studie. Hierin is dan ook onderzoek gedaan naar het verband tussen de thema’s verbonden aan de plaatsen in Borgese’s novellebundel Il pellegrino appassionato (1933) en de rol van deze plekken in zijn leven. Wij hebben ons, na kort het leven en het opus van de schrijver alsmede de plekken die in zijn novelles voorkomen te hebben besproken, gefocust op de rol die de drie belangrijkste plaatsen (Milaan, Florence en Sicilië) en de daarbij bijbehorende thema’s in zowel het leven van Borgese als zijn Il pellegrino appassionato speelden. We hebben kunnen concluderen dat er een verband bestaat tussen de thema’s verbonden aan de eerste twee plaatsen, namelijk het malessere (de slechte mentale gesteldheid) van de personages in de verhalen die zich in Milaan afspeelden en de jeugd in de novelles die plaats hadden in Florence, en het leven van Borgese, die een moeilijke periode doormaakte in de Lombardijse hoofdstad en een groot deel van zijn jeugd doorbracht in de stad aan de Arno. Bovendien konden wij concluderen dat de thema’s in de novelles waar Sicilië een rol speelde, namelijk enerzijds het beeld van Sicilië als mythische en nostalgische plek en anderzijds als een relatief problematische regio, overeenkwamen met hoe deze plek in het oeuvre van andere Siciliaanse auteurs uit de twintigste eeuw werd afgebeeld. Toch is dit eerste thema ook te verbinden aan de nostalgische gevoelens die de schrijver moet hebben ervaren in de tijd dat hij van zijn geboorteplaats gescheiden was. Zijn sicilianità (“sicilianiteit”) is dan ook in deze verhalen terug te zien. Concluderend valt op te merken dat het gebruik van de thema’s verbonden aan de plaatsen uit Il pellegrino appassionato te verklaren is aan de hand van de rol die deze plaatsen speelden in het leven van de schrijver, en dat de combinatie van de leer van de chronotoop van Bachtin en de literaire biografische kritiek tot interessante resultaten heeft geleid."

Due to the increasing culturally and ethnically diverse classrooms, many studies have been conducted on the CRT competencies of teachers. This study aimed to fill the gap in research about the CRT competencies of non-professional teachers. A qualitative study with 16 participants who carry out the citizenship project of the ngo Cross Your Borders was conducted. All participants are interns at the organisation and can be seen as non-professional teachers. An observation has been conducted by a teacher who was present in class during the execution of a project by one of the participants. In addition, interviews with the participants were conducted in order to explore how they perceived their CRT competencies. Also, to explore which potential factors might explain differences between them and other participants. Results revealed that the non-professional teachers showed some extent of CRT competencies, however unconsciously and occasionally. The main differences between non-professional teachers seemed to lay in their educational background and their experiences in education.

First, an evidence-based approach through a literature review of 17 articles identified teaching strategies. The aim was to discuss these strategies through a practice-based approach of 8 semi-structured interviews with life skills programmes in Kenya. The research was guided by the framework from Duron et al., (2006) and data were analysed through a typological analysis. Results show that most strategies used in western countries can also be used in another cultural context like Kenya, such as case study, group discussion, debate, peer learning, and that not all strategies that could work are currently implemented. New strategies are suggested by the participants, such as role-playing, storytelling, showcase videos or fun creative activities, which underline the importance of a sense of community. This supports the idea of a cultural embeddedness of critical thinking, which implies creating bottom-up teaching strategies, considering the specificities of a certain context."
Predictoren voor de effectiviteit van Cognitieve Gedragstherapie in de preventie van depressie bij adolescenten,"['Ruiter, A.L.', 'Zegers, S.A.']","['Heuvel, M. van den']",2021-08-27T18:00:37Z,nl,['CBT; depression prevention; adolescents; age; gender; school level; ethnicity'],Pedagogische Wetenschappen,"To understand how Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can contribute to depression prevention in adolescents and what factors should be taken into account in practice, it is important to distinguish factors that predict the effectiveness of CBT for depression prevention in adolescents. Current research has therefore examined whether age group, gender, school level and ethnicity are predictors for the effectiveness of a whole CBT-prevention program (consisting of 12 sessions), and for the effectiveness of cognitive and behavioral modules separately (all 3 sessions). Depressive symptoms were measured with the Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI-2). The data included data from N = 145 participants and a multiple regression analysis was performed. Results showed that age group, gender, and school level were not significant predictors of the effectiveness of CBT. Ethnicity was found to be a predictor, with depressive symptoms decreasing more in Dutch ethnicity than in non-Dutch ethnicity. With respect to the cognitive modules, no significant differences were found for change in depressive symptoms according to age, gender, and ethnicity. However, school level did provide a significant result, with the effectiveness of the cognitive modules of CBT found to be highest for adolescents with low school levels. For the behavioral modules, none of the variables significantly predicted the effect. The findings provide recommendations for professionals using CBT in the context of depression prevention among adolescents. More research is needed to confirm current results and gain further insight into for whom CBT works."
Can you recognize it?

thumbnail-equivalent for this new type of video format. For this purpose, we define
performance as the accuracy and efficiency of searching for a thumbnail representing a
known part of an immersive video. An experiment was run with 53 participants who were
tasked to recognize an equirectangular thumbnail representing a part of a previously seen
video excerpt in a grid of similar thumbnails. The thumbnails’ sizes and animation were
adjusted for each task. Our analysis shows that both size and animation affect performance,
in terms of efficiency. The results on accuracy are inconclusive. For example, still
thumbnails improved the efficiency by 5% to 25% compared to animated ones and the
larger thumbnail sizes provided significantly better efficiency compared to small
thumbnails. These results are relevant and useful in the endeavor to build better search
engine interfaces for immersive video data."

The results indicate that the number of persons with whom the divorce was discussed is not related to adolescent adjustment. Furthermore, higher levels of satisfaction were related to lower levels of internalizing problem behaviors. However, contrary to the hypotheses, the more satisfied adolescents were about the conversation, the higher their reported externalizing problems Finally, results show that there is no significant sex difference in the association between talking and adolescent adjustment. Thus, having satisfactory conversations could be an important protective factor for the development of internalizing problem behaviors for both males and females, and may therefore contribute to adolescent adjustment."

Uit onderzoeken is gebleken dat een goede en sterke veiligheidscultuur zorgt voor veilig gedrag binnen organisaties en kan leiden tot minder incidenten binnen sectoren met hoge veiligheidsrisico’s, zoals zware industrie, ruimtevaart en transport.
De componenten die bepalend zijn voor een dergelijke cultuur staan nog geregeld open ter discussie, zijn onderhevig aan psychologische ontdekkingen en zijn hevig verbonden met de organisatiepsychologie. Veelal wordt naar veiligheidscultuur gekeken als iets dat de directie creëert en vormgeeft in beleidsstukken. Maar om een beleid uit te voeren, is het van belang dat de doelen door de hele organisatie worden gedragen en dat de cultuurdragers, de medewerkers, zich kunnen vinden in het beleid.
In dit onderzoek is op zoek gegaan naar de perceptie van veiligheidscultuur onder operationele medewerkers. Op deze manier wordt een brug geslagen tussen het strategische niveau dat gaat over het veiligheidsbeleid en de operationele lagen die veilig moeten werken en dit uit kunnen dragen in hun werkzaamheden. Vanuit een casestudie binnen spoorbedrijf ProRail stelt deze studie een nieuwe theorie voor, specifiek gericht om veiligheidscultuur binnen de spoorsector. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat medewerkers bij een veiligheidscultuur met name denken aan open gesprek en discussie over veiligheid, veiligheid een prioriteit maken en intrinsieke motivatie ter verbetering van veiligheid. Gebaseerd op openheid en transparantie, eerlijkheid, vertrouwen en zelfreflectie vinden zij dat een veiligheidscultuur een geheel van houdingen en gedragingen is die tonen dat veiligheid binnen de betreffende organisatie prioriteit heeft en dat mensen veiligheid belangrijk vinden. Ook blijkt dat de rol van management cruciaal is als voorbeeldfiguren en ambassadeurs die het veiligheidsbewustzijn stimuleren en veiligheid op 1 zetten."

Environmental damage and climate change have significant consequences on human security, which brings us to the core of this research: the nexus between climate change and migration. The relevance of the issue under examination has been well expressed by the literature, and studies have found a significant causal relationship between environmental factors and migration. It is precisely for this reason that this relatively new and unexplored field demands for higher legal and political attention, both at the international and at the European Union level. The scale of internal and cross-border migratory flow is expected to rise as a result of accelerated climate change which will force more and more people to leave their homes. This will unarguably have unprecedented impacts on human security all over the world, Europe included. Notwithstanding these predictions, to this day, the term ‘climate refugee’ is not internationally recognised, and the United Nations refugee convention does not provide long-term legal protection to people who flee their home countries due to extreme weather events. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, this research aims to find out to what extent the international, European, and national legal orders already provide for a degree of protection for environmental migrants. Secondly, recommendations on how to regulate the issue in question at the EU level will be provided."

However, there is little to no information available on how the Erasmus+ programme tries to enhance interculturality, i.e. the policy input regarding interculturality. Therefore, this thesis tries to understand how the Erasmus+ programme can maximize its potential, by zooming in on one of its new, flagship initiatives: the European Universities Initiative. This initiative aims to create networks of different European universities, so-called alliances. The research questions leading this thesis, is: How successful are the European University Alliances in the creation of intercultural competences among students, beyond mobility? Three alliances – ECIU, EPICUR and ENLIGHT – have been researched in their ability to be successful in IC-acquisition among students. On the basis of four indicators, derived from theory, successfulness could be determined. In conclusion, the alliances are moderately successful in the creation of IC among students, beyond mobility. Where they excel in teaching methods that really foster the development of the skills, a lot can still be improved regarding the creation of a harmonized, integrated strategy, which also focusses on attracting a culturally diverse group of students."

Aansluitend op zowel het film discours als het Gender Studies discours, dient dit onderzoek als eerste stap in het vullen van de lacune die aanwezig is rond onderzoek van genderrepresentatie in Nederlandse jeugdfilms. Het onderzoek baseert zich op het idee uit de Gender Studies dat gender een sociaal construct zou zijn, en gaat hierbij uit van De lauretis’ argumentatie dat gender geconstrueerd wordt door onder andere representatie in media. Met behulp van Thompson’s neoformalistische benadering wordt er in dit onderzoek gekeken naar hoe de
stilistische elementen in de film bepaalde gegenderde posities construeren voor de hoofdpersonages Ben, zijn vriendin Sylvie en zijn vader Koos. De analyse wordt uitgevoerd aan de hand van theorieën van Mulvey; Segrave, McDowell & King III; en Finklea. Bovendien wordt er onderzocht of er een ontwikkeling te zien is in deze positie door de film heen, om vervolgens aan te tonen op welke wijze er dominante ideologieën aanwezig zijn achter de representatie van gender. Uit de analyse komt naar voren hoe Ben door de film heen ontplooit van onzekere en onhandige “New man” (gevoelig, het subject dat bekeken wordt) net als zijn vader Koos, tot een bekwame “Old man” (die meer kennis en macht heeft dan anderen, die anderen mag bekijken). Koos, die eveneens begon in een “New man” positie, eindigt echter in dezelfde “New man” positie, maar weet wel een hogere positie te houden dan de vrouwelijke personages om hem heen. Tot slot verandert Sylvie juist van subject tot object, van meisje dat zeggenschap probeert te behouden ondanks de verwachtingen rondom haar vrouwelijke gender, tot een meisje dat zich vrijwillig bekeken laat worden en haar verwachte passieve, exhibitionistische positie inneemt."

in autism spectrum disorder may be the key to more effective treatment. Previous research 
implicates the cerebellum in aggression, specifically lobules right Crus I and II and VIIIA/B. 
Objective: This study investigated the relationship between cerebellar grey matter volumes and 
aggression in children with ASD and neurotypical children, and verbal IQ as a possible moderator. 
Methods: Volumetric data from 200 3T MRI scans of children with ASD and neurotypical children, 
ages 8-13, was used. The aggression measures were extracted from the Child Behavior Checklist. 
Results: The stepwise regression analysis showed a significant relationship between the grey matter 
volume of right lobule VIIIA and aggression scores in children with ASD. Verbal IQ had no moderation 
effect. 
Discussion: Aggression in children with ASD may stem from impaired somatosensory processing 
since overstimulation can lead to aggression. This may explain the implication of right lobule VIIIA as 
it plays a role in sensorimotor processing. The effect was found in the right posterior area of the 
cerebellum, which corroborates the contralateral association with the frontal cortex, where 
aggression correlates with relatively higher activity in the left hemisphere. 
Conclusion: This explorative study yielded many leads for future research on the implication of the 
right posterior cerebellum in aggression, its treatment in children with ASD, and the role of impaired 
somatosensory processing."

Political consequences such as distrust, a loss in legitimacy, exclusion of political minorities and over-representation of political elites pose problems to the existing political structure. By answering the research question ‘can a descriptive conception of representation be theoretically and practically unified with a substantive conception of representation within a democratic party system?’, this thesis tries to provide a solution to the abovementioned problems. The thesis provides arguments for the intrinsic and instrumental importance of descriptive representation for political representation, a conception that is argued to be pluralistic in nature. After applying this new, pluralistic conception to a democratic party model that features cartel parties, five suggestions for improved representation arise: to connect representatives more to civil society, to disconnect them more from the state, to use quotes, better recruitment efforts or lotteries to ensure that electoral candidates represent the populace descriptively. Thus, the thesis provides a comprehensive, interdisciplinary, theoretical and practical analysis of what it means to represent in contemporary democracies."

systems, and we looked at one specific, promising solution called the secondary ethical layer.
The secondary ethical layer is a general ethical filter which filters out any unethical
recommendations based on cultural and personal preferences while also taking into account
all the different stakeholders on which recommendations can have an effect (such as the user,
provider, system and society). We have found that this solution can solve some ethical issues,
specifically with regards to inappropriate content, unfairness (biases) and issues for society. It
does not solve problems such as the lack of opacity and some privacy issues within
recommender systems. This thesis identifies different key elements of the ethical layer and
creates the fundaments on which a practical solution can be built."

This research answers the research question: What types of continuity and discontinuity do minoritized professionals experience and create between their workplace and personal life? To address this issue, 15 professionals from minoritized groups participated in semi-structured interviews followed by a thematic analysis. Findings indicate that there are common patterns of continuity and discontinuity based on the broad categories of given continuity, intended continuity, given discontinuity and intended discontinuity."

An evaluation of the Dutch company bicycle policy measure ‘fiets van de zaak’,"['Brantjes, Michiel']","['Meelen, T.']",2023-03-16T12:53:32Z,,"['Company bike, leasing, bike, e-bike, speed pedelec, policy evaluation, Product-Service System']",Sustainable Business and Innovation,"To contribute to a sustainable mobility system, the Dutch Ministry of Finance has adjusted the Dutch company bike policy measure. Starting January 1st 2020, the Ministry introduced a new policy allowing employers to place a bike at the disposal of the employee for only 7% addition on the salary of the employee by means of a lease construction. The functioning of this measure is evaluated by means of the OECD (2019) policy evaluation framework, which was adjusted with additional factors relevant for Product Service Systems (PSSs). In Product Service Systems the user has access over the product for a longer period of time, while the service provider stays the owner of the product and provides services. Leasing is considered an example of this. This leads to the following evaluation criteria: relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, and impact. Impact has influence on: durable design, consumption and cooperation. 
The results of the 20 conducted interviews with various stakeholders and a literature study present a variegated picture of the functioning of the policy measure. In general, the adjustment of the policy measure is seen as an improvement for both the government as well as the employers and employees. It has received a lot of positive media attention, which has spread awareness, but also caused misinterpretations. The functioning of the measure depends on the financial contribution of the employer to the bicycle. Generally, the employer accounts for a large share of the costs and introduces a high administrative burden to many of the employers and employees. Additionally, the measure is only beneficial to specific groups of people. Currently, the target number of adopters of 150,000 set by societal organisations is not accomplished by far. Nevertheless, higher-level effects on stakeholders seem positive and hold potential for the future; the end-users handle their bikes well and cycle more for both private and work objectives and the stakeholders in the supply chain are more intensively connected to each other, leading to a more mature market. In order to extensively promote the company bike, an improvement of the VAT deduction and a reduced administrative burden is of primary importance.
Finally, the adjusted OECD framework used in this thesis can enable researchers as well as practitioners to evaluate the functioning of other policy measures focussed on a Product Service System."

The purpose of EIA is to ensure the potential environmental impacts are addressed and mitigation efforts are in place at the pre-decision stage of a project; it also aims to provide information on the consequences of the development to ensure the implementation criteria are met at the post-decision stage. EIA follow-up is the last phase of the process in an EIA to achieve the post-decision stage goal that was set during the EIA process. However, the follow-up process is rarely done in practice since it requires substantial resources in terms of money, time and expert for different stakeholders.

With the development of Earth Observation (EO) and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies, there is an opportunity to enhance data collection and processing in a more accessible and low-cost way to meet the needs of the EIA follow-up phase. With the development of the internet and mobile devices, Citizen Science (CS) is a valuable tool to collect ground truth data, commonly used to validate satellite imagery processing methods.

Land use and land cover (LULC) change is a significant environmental variable addressed in EIA and monitored by EO. This research developed and tested a feasible workflow to monitor and evaluate an environmental impact on LULC from two proposed EIA follow-up using freely accessible EO and GIS software, Google Earth Engine. Then a CS app was developed using ArcGIS Field Maps to collect ground truth data in a test area. The results showed it is a replicable workflow in terms of the availability of the open dataset and algorithms, the accuracy of the monitoring outcomes, availability of CS application, and quality of ground truth data collected by CS. It provides an achievable entry point regarding low-cost and low technical skills needed for related parties and raises public engagement to establish a better EIA follow-up monitoring network. Further efforts should focus on building a framework for implementing this monitoring process properly to different types of EIA cases in terms of land use categories."

But he was  almost never there to enforce these rules. This is where Hermes comes in. His attributes made him exceptionally suitable to mingle among the humans in order for them to obey Zeus.

The Influence of Chromatin Domains on the Repair of Double-Strand Breaks,"['Sandron, Arianna']","['Janssen, Aniek']",2022-01-24T15:26:35Z,EN,['chromatin; euchromatin; heterochromatin; double-strand break; dsb; dna repair;'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent particularly dangerous forms of DNA damage that can result in the formation of mutations and chromosomal rearrangements when unrepaired or misrepaired. In order to preserve genome integrity, DSBs can be processed and repaired through several pathways, including homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). As the final repair products depend on the pathway utilized to restore the damage, the process of repair pathway choice constitutes a crucial step of DSB repair. In eukaryotes, chromatin is classified into two main domains, euchromatin and heterochromatin, each exhibiting differences in protein composition and function. While both euchromatin and heterochromatin can be subjected to DSB formation, it has recently been proposed that the chromatin environment surrounding the DSB site might contribute to the repair pathway choice process. Both pre-existing and damage-induced histone marks, histone variants and chromatin associated proteins of euchromatin and heterochromatin have been found to be involved in several steps of DSB repair in their respective domains, including the selective recruitment of certain repair proteins to promote the usage of specific repair pathways. This suggests that the role of euchromatin- or heterochromatin- proteins during DSB repair is to promote the usage of repair pathways that suit best the characteristics of their respective domains. Here, we discuss the influence of chromatin components on DSB repair. More specifically, we will focus on the roles covered by histone marks, histone variants and non-histone proteins associated with euchromatin and heterochromatin in different steps of DSB repair."

Furthermore, the role of sports associations in legitimising the video referee in the sports community is studied by making use of legitimisation strategy theory. Based on the analysis of game regulations and the combination of qualitative interview input and the quantification of media sentiments, it was possible to determine whether an interaction would cause a negative or positive sentiment in the sports community. It was found that legitimacy increases when user actor groups are involved both in-game and during the innovation trajectory. Moreover, legitimacy appeared to increase when the complexity of the system was diminished in order to make the implementation of the video referee within the existing regulations easier. Also, centralised governance by the international sports association seemed to increase legitimacy. With regard to the role of sports associations, framing the situation without the video referee implemented appeared to be a preliminary condition before starting the innovation trajectory. Collaboration as a strategy was considered vital, due to a significant decrease in legitimacy when not deployed and a significant increase when deployed.

Gradual Acceptability for Structured Argumentation in ASPIC+,"['Houwelingen, Leon van']","['Prakken, Henri']",2022-01-21T00:00:18Z,EN,['Gradual Semantics; ASPIC+'],Artificial Intelligence,"Argumentation is a reasoning approach in Artificial Intelligence, which is approached
by extension-based methods as well as gradual approaches. In the
literature one is often vague about the type of argument strength that is studied
and it is mostly approached avoiding structured argumentation. Thereby, assumptions
are made on abstract level that do not always hold at the structural
level.
In this work we answer the question how a semantics for dialectical argument
strength in structured approaches to argumentation can be developed and evaluated.
To that end two new semantics will be proposed using ASPIC+, one
for argumentation frameworks with only attacks, one for argumentation frameworks
with only supports. Both of these semantics will be evaluated by the
postulates proposed in the literature as well as by postulates proposed in this
work. Existing semantics will also be evaluated by the new postulates."
BIM/IFC-files As Input For 3D Land Administration Systems,"['Broekhuizen, Marjan']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-01-24T15:26:43Z,EN,['BIM; IFC; LADM; RRR; Land Administration; 3D; BIM/IFC-model; Apartment Rights;'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"The growth of cities and the pressure on land worldwide leads to more complex and multilevel structures with different space interrelations. For the registration of complex spaces mostly 2D Land Administration Systems (LAS) are used, while a representation of space in 3D could provide a clearer insight. Concurrently, technological advancements rapidly improve methods to collect, create, visualise, register, store and disseminate 3D data. In this context, much research is now being carried out at the sources and data used as input in 3D LAS and the various methods for their collection. In this scene, the approach to reuse data from the design phase is gaining ground. Specifically existing Building Information Models (BIMs), usually encoded in the non-proprietary Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format (ISO 16739-1:2018, 2018) are considered a promising source for 3D LAS.
Previous research has shown promising results using BIMs as input for 3D LAS. However, the use of IFC-models from practice has not yet been tested adequately. This research investigates the technical issues that are encountered when using real-world IFC-models as input for the registration of apartment rights in a 3D LAS and how that process can be improved. In the context of this thesis, IFC-models are iteratively being validating against technical requirements. Five real-world IFC-models are collected.
They are validated on the existence of IfcSpace, the ability to relate the IFC-model to the LAS, the validity of geometries, spatial relations i.e. overlap, and the ability to georeference the IFC-models. The results of these validation show that the collected IFC-models lack the ability to be georeferenced. Additionally most IFC-models did not contain IfcSpace, or a relation to essential attributes for identifying legal units in the Dutch 3D LAS. Recommendations and guidelines are formulated to address these issues. The IFC-models are placed in a 3D LAS at a conceptual level, in which the legal spaces are enriched with information of the Rights, Restrictions and Responsibilities (RRR's) to those spaces in line with the Land Administration Domain Model  LADM)(ISO 19152:2012, 2012). For this a mapping between IFC and LADM is made. 
The results of this thesis include the set of validations and its derived recommendations and guidelines. Additionally a conceptual 3D LAS is made, which consists of a PostgreSQL database, which is LADM compliant, and is visualised in 3D tiles using a Cesium web viewer."

At this moment, the only viable
therapy for end-stage liver diseases is liver transplantation. Liver transplantation, as first successfully
performed by Dr Thomas Starzl in 1967, has made it possible for a patient with severe end-stage liver
disease to recover. However, the need for liver transplantations has been rising over the years, with
now over 30.000 transplantations performed worldwide every year. The number of patients
requiring transplantation is rising while there are not enough donors, leading to long waiting lists.
During the past decades, major advances have been made to fill this gap of available donors. A
recent advance is the ability to sustain a liver outside of the body for 7 days. This new technique,
long-term machine perfusion, could open up exciting new treatment possibilities: extended duration
of long-term machine perfusion could enable genetic modulation on perfused livers, regeneration of
partial livers or bioengineering combined with liver perfusion. This review explains how long-term
machine perfusion works and discusses the possibilities this technique would enable, looking at
already existing techniques in ongoing research and hypothesize how long-term machine perfusion
would aid in these techniques."

associated diseases such as cardiovascular disease. In some cases the disease can be
treated with novel medical devices such as pacemakers but for others transplantation
remains the only viable option. This is often the case for patients with heart valve failure.
However, there is a worldwide organ shortage for transplantation. This has led to the
development of different types of heart valve prosthetics. Mechanical heart valves are
durable but increase the risk of thromboembolism, resulting in patients needing to take
lifelong anticoagulant therapy which has severe side effects. Patients with bioprosthetic
heart valve prosthetics do not need to take anticoagulant therapy but risk repeated
open-heart surgery because bioprosthetic heart valves are less durable. Tissue-engineered
heart valves are newest to the market but have not yet reached their full potential and are
therefore not yet frequently used. The development of these different types of heart valves
has led to multiple different ethical discussions. Here, we will discuss which types of heart
valves have given rise to which ethical considerations and whether these discussions have
ceased or remain applicable with the development of new types of heart valve prosthetics. In
particular we will try to gauge whether past and current ethical discussions regarding heart
valve prosthetics will be applicable to the future regenerative tissue-engineered heart valves

Because of motion of the scanned patient, these images may be distorted causing so called motion artifacts in the image. There are several techniques available to correct for motion. The MR system contains directional couplers (DICOs), those were originally added to the hardware for safety measurements by monitoring the forward and reflected data of the radiofrequency (RF) signal for the eight channels on the head coil. The aim of this research is to see if the forward and reflected data can be used to detect motion. Subsequently is examined whether motion parameters of the subjects head and the RF data are linearly related. The accuracy and reproducibility of the estimated motion is examined within and over subject. To obtain a motion correction matrix (MCM), motion parameter data from FSL/FEAT (a library of analysis tools for MRI data) was linearly related to the impedance of the 8-channel head coil by left array division of the two matrices. The quality of the fit of the estimated motion is very high. The estimated motion within the same subject, but with use of another MCM, show the same pattern, but with a shift. The method does not work when used over subjects. Additional research, concerning the data processing technique, is required to optimize the method to have it implemented as a real-time motion correction technique."
Questioning the ideal of policy integration: The influence of environmental assessments on achieving policy integration through the development of municipal Environmental Visions in the Netherlands,"['Thomas, Björn']","['Macrorie, Rachel']",2022-01-14T00:00:16Z,EN,"['integrated planning, environmental policy integration, Environment and Planning Act, environmental assessment, Omgevingsvisie']",Spatial Planning,"Planners and policy-makers around the world are implementing an integrated approach to tackle contemporary cross-cutting urban challenges. The Dutch are doing this as well by drastically changing their planning and environmental policy system with the new integrated Environment and Planning Act (EPA). The EPA obligates all levels of government to develop an Environmental Vision which includes and integrates all spatial and environmental objectives and ambitions for the upcoming 20-30 years. The Netherlands Commission for Environmental Assessment (NCEA) obligates all governments to conduct an environmental assessment (EA) on these visions. However, there has been recent debate on the role and effect of EA as a tool for enabling policy integration. Therefore, this study means to research to what extent EA (applied as part of integrated policy-making processes) helps Dutch municipalities to agree an Environmental Vision.

This research focused on two case studies in the Netherlands: the municipality of Lisse and the municipality of Doetinchem. Through document analyses and interviews, this research has found that EA processes can have an effect on the development process of Environmental Visions. EA provides in-depth research, helps with formulating clear ambitions, maintains a clear planning process and structure, and offers independent advice and unbiased expertise. However, the research also showed that EA lacks in legal power, highly depends on the quality of the financial and informational inputs, and differs in effectiveness based on its entry point in the process.

This research showed that EA helps to agree a municipal Environmental Vision and thus helps to enable integrated policy-making in the Netherlands. However, its effect depends on the political and financial context and its perceived purpose in the overall process of policy integration."
Doorbroken dichotomieën: Marcel Duchamp en Claude Cahun door de lens van de tweede en derde feministische golf,"['Nikkessen, Joost']","['Rossem, R. van']",2022-01-12T16:10:46Z,NL,['surrealisme; zelfportret; Marcel Duchamp; Claude Cahun; tweede feministische golf; derde feministische golf; feminisme; gender; queer'],Kunstgeschiedenis,"Tegen de achtergrond van het binaire man-vrouwdenken in surrealistische tentoonstellingen en publicaties maakt deze thesis de zelfportretten van Marcel Duchamp (1887-1968) en Claude Cahun (1894-1954) het onderwerp van een revisie van de genderverhoudingen binnen het surrealisme. In specifieke zin worden deze casestudies geanalyseerd door de lens van de tweede en derde feministische golf. De onderzoeksvraag luidt daarbij als volgt: hoe doorbreken de zelfportretten van Duchamp en Cahun man vrouwdichotomieën? 

De kunstgeschiedschrijving en tentoonstellingsgeschiedenis tijdens de tweede feministische golf verwerpen de misvatting dat de kunstgeschiedenis een neutraal, monocausaal verhaal met mannen in de hoofdrol is. Deze theoretici bestuderen en presenteren de seksen van het surrealisme als dichotomieën of structurele opposities. Daarentegen verschuift de kunstgeschiedschrijving tijdens de derde feministische golf het paradigma van man-vrouwdichotomieën naar een intersectioneel genderbegrip. Het queer perspectief waaruit deze auteurs het surrealisme herzien, vindt echter tot op heden weinig weerklank in de tentoonstellingsgeschiedenis. 

Wanneer we de zelfportretten van Duchamp en Cahun tegen het erfgoed van de twee feministische golven houden, kunnen we concluderen dat deze casestudies de man vrouwdichotomieën doorbreken die de tweede feministische golf opponeert en derde feministische golf ontkracht. Circa 1920 starten beide kunstenaars voor en achter de camera met het ontwrichten van traditionele man-vrouwrollen en subject-objectposities. Waar Duchamp zijn veelvormige ‘drag persona’ R(r)ose Sélavy in het leven roept om zijn eigen autonomie en autoriteit te bevragen, zet Cahun maskerade en make-up in om een divers palet aan androgyne alter ego’s aan te nemen. 

Kortom: de zelfportretten van Duchamp en Cahun illustreren dat de surrealistische visie op gender minder binair is dan man-vrouwdichotomieën toestaan. Deze thesis besluit dan ook dat het een uitdaging vormt om mannelijke, vrouwelijke en non-binaire surrealisten niet langer in aparte canons en tentoonstellingen op te nemen en het intersectioneel denken van de derde feministische golf door te trekken naar de museumzaal."
Are the regional water authorities assessming of the impact of small hydraulic systems on water quality in accordance with the european water framework directive,"['Jong, ET de']","['Dieperink, Carel']",2022-01-01T00:00:18Z,EN,[],Water Science and Management,"According to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Weser arrest, it isn’t allowed to cause 
any degradation of the water quality. This rule is challenging for regional water authorities and 
raises the following question: 
To what extent does, the practice of assessing and addressing the impacts of small hydraulic 
structures on the water qualities by the regional water authorities, meet the standards set by EU 
law? 
To answer this question, the following steps are taken. First an framework is created, which is 
used to analyses the assessment practice of the regional water authority Hollandse Delta (WSHD). 
In order to find out whether the practice of the WSHD is representative for all regional water 
authorities the results of the case study are translated into survey statements and questions. Most 
of the regional water authorities reacted on the survey.
In the analytical framework water quality has been defined. Water quality consist out of two 
categories: the chemical component and the ecological component. This definition is used by the 
EU in the WFD. Monitoring water quality is taking place in designated WFD waters that represent a 
larger water system. How to monitor is described in the WFD documents and is translated by the 
STOWA in the nine ecological key factors. In a water system several kinds of small hydraulic 
structures can be created, all of these small hydraulic structures may have negative effects on the 
water quality.
The case study shows the effect that small hydraulic structures have on water quality but how this 
can be assessed is barely described in policy documents of WSHD. There is only stated that no 
significant degradation is allowed. There is a new policy document of the WSHD coming, which 
states that the water quality may not be reduced. Clear strategy for assessing impacts of small 
hydraulic structures on the water quality however is missing. This cause some challenges that the 
WSHD faces like how to act on the contradiction between the current and the new policy 
documents.
The survey reveals that most regional water authorities struggle with the same question of how to 
assess the change in water quality caused by the construction of small hydraulic structures. 
The conclusion, the assessing and addressing of small hydraulic structures is done to a limited 
extant and therefor the standards by the EU are met with a limited extant."
Closing the loop; a circular construction sector by 2050,"['Wal, Emile van de']","['Rosales Carreon, Jesus']",2022-01-12T16:10:45Z,EN,['Circularity; built environment; materials; building materials;'],Sustainable Development,"The construction sector has a large environmental impact and waste contribution. The sector is the number one consumer of raw materials and 30% of global greenhouse gases can be attributed to the building sector. In the Netherlands the construction sector is accountable for 46% of total waste. This heavy environmental pressure stresses the need for reduction. The Dutch government has the ambition of having a circular economy (CE) by 2050 and a reduction of 50% in primary resource use by 2030 to decrease this environmental pressure. Fuelled by these ambitions, the development of tools that increase building circularity has been growing. So has the concept of a materials passport (MP). The materials passport can be considered as an inventory of building products used during construction and its characteristics. Rigid guidelines to what it should include are lacking and standardization is not present. Using qualitative interview data from experts and assessment of current existing MP practices, this research aims to identify the information needs, potential pitfalls to using the MP and assess its possible contribution in the transition towards a CE in 2050. Having information on what building materials, products and elements have been used in a building, is assumed to lead to more reuse at end of life (EOL). This research shows that for the implementation of the MP as a tool to accelerate the transition towards a circular construction sector, several important adjustments are necessary. The current existing MP practices do not resemble what the building sector thinks is necessary in a passport for it to be useful. According to the experts questioned in this research, information on releasability, material properties, dimensions, toxicity information and structuring based on lifetime is indispensable. Besides these information needs, the environment and infrastructure in which the passports operate can be considered as underdeveloped. Practices show that to achieve reuse, recovery or recycling, the passport is not necessarily the key to success. To use the passport as a tool that aids the transition from a linear construction sector to a circular sector, standardization according to previous needs is not the only necessity. Policymakers and the sector have to further develop the framework of the passport, the infrastructure it is embedded in and the supply chain cooperation that is required, whilst practices that achieve high reuse at EOL have to be supported to achieve short term impact."

Lysosomal compartments in cancer showed various differences compared to normal conditions, such as their activity, biogenesis, hydrolytic activity and exocytosis. The lysosome itself contains many ionic channels on its membrane which regulate lysosomal activity and functionality, among which TRPML-1, a calcium releasing channel, was shown to play an important role in cancer invasion. In this study we investigated the role TRPML-1 has in lysosomal regulation and in HT1080 cancer invasion specifically. Overexpression of these channels in HT1080 cells caused the creation of enlarged endolysosomal compartments possessing the same acidic range as normal lysosomes, and containing active cathepsin and calcium ions in their intraluminal environments. On the other hand, depletion of TRPML-1 caused slightly smaller and more lysosomal organelles to appear in HT1080 cells. We also showed TRPML-1 alteration not merely alters lysosomal organelles, but also affects other organelles within the cell, with regard to their interaction and distribution. We showed increased association of ER and mitochondria upon TRPML-1 depletion and the appearance of lipid droplets in these cells. We also showed TRPML-1 knockdown increased the level of lysosomal proteins and translocated transcription factor E3 to the nucleus. In line with the link between this channel and invasive cancer we showed that TRPML-1 upregulation significantly increases lysosomal exocytosis, which in turn increases ECM degradation and cell migration."
Obsessive-compulsive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic: the relationship between symptoms and the use of various media,"['Hagen, Olivier van']","['Meyerbroker, Katharina']",2022-01-13T00:00:16Z,EN,['OCD symptoms; pandemic; media'],Clinical Psychology,"Abstract
Background: Individuals suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) might experience an exacerbation of symptoms as the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental measures warrant behaviors resembling OCD symptoms. The fears invoked by frequent use of social media and high news consumption might contribute to elevated OCD symptomatology. 
Method: This study investigated whether a sample of Dutch OCD patients (n = 26) experienced an increase in symptoms during to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, it investigated hypothesized positive correlations between OCD levels and variables such as time spent on social media and time spent watching regular news channels, whilst controlling for intolerance of uncertainty. Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scales were administered to measure OCD levels. Other scales concerned the intolerance of uncertainty scale short form and questions regarding news consumption. A semi-structured interview was conducted to support the statistical data. 
Results: Qualitative data showed some reports of elevated OCD symptoms, but statistical analyses yielded no general increase of OCD symptoms in the population of OCD patients. 
Time spent watching news via regular media as well as time spent using social media did not correlate with OCD levels. 
Conclusion: No proof was found for an exacerbation of OCD symptoms in the population of OCD patients due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When controlling for intolerance of uncertainty, time spent watching news via regular media and use of social media did not correlate with higher OCD levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was characterized by large percentages of missing data. Hence, results should be interpreted cautiously."

The total sample consisted of 1,502 11-20 years old sexually experienced Dutch high-school students (713 participants from 2009 and 789 participants from 2017). Trends in the predictors of sexual onset were evaluated using hierarchical multiple regression analyses. It was found that lower education, a non-Western migration status, and early puberty were associated with an early sexual onset. Unexpectedly, gender (boys) was associated with an early age of onset, and higher levels of alcohol use were associated with a later age of onset. Furthermore, increasing levels of education, along with an altered structure of educational level in relation to sexual onset, may have (marginally) contributed to the delay in sexual onset. Concerning the growing educational inequalities in sexual onset, the results of this study could be of importance for policy and intervention purposes."

The relationship between social media dependency and emotional problems was fully mediated by sleep quality. A direction for future research is exploring other underlying mediating factors of the relationship between social media dependency and emotional problems, because little is known about it longitudinally. In addition, schools can also look at the positive effect of sleep quality, which may help in reducing emotional problems among adolescents."

However, little is known about the role an experience like trusting others can play in the development of future orientations. Therefore, this study examined the association between both interpersonal and institutional trust with three future orientations outcomes and investigate how this association might change across different socioeconomic groups.
Method: Cross-sectional data from 1.128 Dutch students (Mage = 17,3, SD = 1,729) who self-reported their future expectations, positive and negative future emotions, interpersonal trust, institutions trust, and their family affluence, was used to answer the research questions. 
Results:  Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that, both institutional and interpersonal trust are significantly associated with better future orientations, although these associations were strongest for interpersonal trust. Against expectations, results showed that the relationship between trust and future orientations was not different across socioeconomic groups, as only three out of twelve possible interactions were significant. 
Conclusions: The findings suggest that trusting your close environment may be particularly important for more positive future orientations. As such the results indicate the importance of developing interventions that can enhance the engagement of adolescents with their communities."

Moreover, there is controversy in theories and in the empirical field regarding the association between loneliness and social media use among adolescents. Therefore, this study aims to shed light on the association by conducting a meta-analysis. In this meta-analysis, 42 studies were included with adolescents from 12-25 years old, in 18 countries. Random-effects analyses and regression analyses were conducted. The results showed no significant association between social media use and loneliness. Furthermore, the influence of several moderators on the association were examined: gender, age, used loneliness questionnaire, country and social media platform. All those categories did not significantly predict the strength of the association between adolescents’ social media use and loneliness. Separate meta-analyses were conducted for active and passive social media use. These meta-analyses were also not significant. Further research should focus on more specific motivations and mechanisms of social media use, rather than broad categories and time spent on social media."

Most participants indicated that they experienced some kind of schoolwork pressure. Individual factors like resilience, optimism, self-efficacy, confidence, but also social support from family and friends, leisure activities and helpful teachers appear to be facilitating factors in coping with schoolwork pressure. Low levels of self-efficacy, optimism, resilience and self-esteem, using no coping method, peer and/or family stressors, no/little social support from family and friends and no or limited involvement in leisure activities appear to be barriers in coping with schoolwork pressure. Within this study, there does not seem to be much difference in age, gender and educational level when it comes to the degree of perceived schoolwork pressure, but there appear to be differences in how participants cope with schoolwork pressure. There are several barriers and facilitators that emerge with regard to schoolwork pressure. Further research is needed to investigate the relative importance and the mechanisms of these factors in relation to schoolwork pressure."

The data was obtained from the YOUth Got Talent project among MBO-students older than 16 years in Utrecht (N = 1231). The results show that girls have slightly lower future orientations than boys in term of future expectations, but not in terms of future emotions. Also, it was found that these differences are explained by girls’ lower selfesteem and more frequent experiences of gender discrimination. Although differences are small, the results of this study signal some still existing gender differences in terms of future

Methods: Data from the 2017 HBSC-study were used, in which complete data were available from 5999 participants aged 11-18 (M = 13.72, SD = 1.35), attending the first four years of secondary education. Results: Binary logistic regressions showed educational differences for all substances, which in turn, showed higher chances of reporting truancy. No educational differences were found for the student-teacher relationship. Employment of the parents, family affluence, and classroom atmosphere were not related to truancy. Conclusion: Students in lower educational levels were more likely to report truancy. The final model tested cannabis use, alcohol use, smoking, growing up in a one-parent household, and being bullied as possible mediators, which could partially explain educational differences. Remarkable is the direct relationship between substance use and truancy, which is much stronger than the direct link tested in this study. Future research should therefore focus on the mechanisms behind substance use and truancy."

When adolescents don’t watch porn and perceive online porn as realistic, they rate their sexual skills lower. In addition, girls who regularly watch porn rate their sexual skills as better than girls who don’t watch porn, whereas boys rate their sexual skills as worse than boys who don’t  watch porn.

Friends and music are two important sources for adolescents’ life satisfaction (Trimbos Institute, 2020). This research focuses on the relationship between music preference and life satisfaction from a sociological point of view. It seeks to examine whether the relationship between music preference and life satisfaction is explained by two underlying mechanisms, namely having more online friends and the quality of friendships. To answer the research question, cross-sectional data from the HBSC study is used. The representative sample of this research consists of 1451 Dutch high school students (Mage =14; SDage = 1.56; 43.7% boys). Results showed that music preference is correlated with life satisfaction (beta = -0.18; p < .01). Adolescents who prefer nonmainstream music have a significantly lower life satisfaction than adolescents who prefer mainstream music. Contrary to expectations, this relation was not explained by the two underlying mechanisms that were tested, namely having more online friends and the quality of friendships. Yet, the results of this study should only be understood in the context of the study and its limitations."
De betekenis van vrijheid bij gebruiksculturen van Netflix: Kwalitatief publieksonderzoek naar Netflix-gebruik in 2021,"['Blitterswijk, Michael van']","['Valck, Marijke de']",2022-01-01T00:00:29Z,NL,"['gebruikscultuur, Netflix, televisieconsumptie, publieksonderzoek, semigestructureerde diepte-interviews, informed grounded theory, kijkerspraktijken, binge-watching']",Film- en Televisiewetenschap,"Bij het uitbrengen van HOUSE OF CARDS introduceerde Netflix een nieuwe vorm van televisieconsumptie, namelijk binge-watching. Bij binge-watching worden er meerdere afleveringen achter elkaar gekeken en wordt een serie snel uitgekeken. Binnen de televisiewetenschap zijn verschillende onderzoeken uitgevoerd naar binge-watching, zonder specifiek naar kijkerspraktijken zelf te kijken. Televisiewetenschapper Graeme Turner pleit echter voor etnografisch publieksonderzoek naar het daadwerkelijk gebruik van Netflix binnen een huishouden, zonder specifiek te kijken naar binge-watching.  Op basis van deze aanbeveling wordt in deze scriptie publieksonderzoek uitgevoerd naar het gebruik van Netflix en staat daarmee de gebruikscultuur van Netflix bij Nederlandse twintigers met een WO-achtergrond centraal. 
Na het afnemen van semigestructureerde diepte-interviews werd aan de hand van de informed grounded theory een analyse uitgevoerd. Uit de resultaten komt naar voren dat het gebruik van Netflix afhankelijk is van verschillende persoonlijke omstandigheden en de samenstelling van het huishouden waar respondenten onderdeel van uitmaken. Verder wordt duidelijk dat vrijheid bij de gebruikscultuur van respondenten belangrijk is en dat verschillende betekenissen van vrijheid zorgen voor een eigen manier van Netflix-gebruik. 
Binnen dit onderzoek zijn geen observaties uitgevoerd door de invoering van de maatregelen tegen het coronavirus. Interviews zijn online afgenomen waardoor het moeilijker was om op antwoorden in te gaan. Hierdoor zou het in de toekomst bruikbaar zijn om onderzoek uit te voeren zoals Turner voorstelt. Binnen dit soort onderzoek dient data te worden verzameld via observaties en interviews binnen de huiselijke ruimte. Ondanks de limieten van dit onderzoek, tonen de resultaten aan dat het gebruik van Netflix verschilt met bevindingen uit bestaand onderzoek naar hedendaagse televisieconsumptie. Daarom dient meer publieksonderzoek te worden uitgevoerd naar gebruiksculturen bij SVOD-platformen als Netflix."
Staging Invisible Disease in Dance Performance,"['Komoza, Kseniia']","['Georgelou, Konstantina']",2022-01-01T00:00:18Z,EN,[],"Contemporary Theatre, Dance and Dramaturgy","This thesis examines the staging strategies of invisible disease in contemporary dance performances. I create a foundation for exploring what stands for invisible disease in each of the case studies, using Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s reading by three contemporary philosophers Ian Buchanan, Nick Fox, and Cameron Duff. I then move to different constituent elements of the diseases, introducing those that affect it most significantly, such as “messiness of the body” or “labelling,” activating these concepts through researchers like Petra Kuppers and Michel Foucault. I then propose to look at the dance performance as an alternative vision machine, which possibly subverts the power modalities, creating a possibility for the creators and dancers to examine diseased bodies by themselves and giving voice to the muted object of medical procedures. From this perspective, I offer a performance analysis of very different, yet closely related, cases of invisible diseases and show how the performance allows them to become visible. I also argue that the practice of sharing knowledge about a disease does not always demand a full understanding of the condition, nor does it allow one to fully understand the disease. Thus, the staging strategies I examine create the opportunity to co-research and co-question the experience.
In the first case study, The Ephemeral Life of an Octopus (2019) by Léa Tirabasso, I show how a disease is made visible through something I call “a monstrosity of cancer cells.” I describe how a specific approach to the rehearsal process in the form of research led a choreographer with dancers to an active deconstruction of the habitual movement which embodies the “monstrosity of cancer cells.” I also propose the term “machinistic hum” which helps me to define the atmosphere of a factory where the body seems to be depicted as a broken detail of a huge machinery. In the second case study, Bent out of shape (2019) by Suzie Davies and Mattias Ekholm, I unite choreographic and scenographical decisions under the term “laboratorium,” a place where the body is an object for self-research and dissection. I show how the place of a dance piece allows a practice of dissection to stop “muting” the object of the research by giving it “voice.” With readings from Olivier Bert, I move to the third case study, Only Mine Alone (2016) by artistic duo Ana Dubljević and Igor Koruga and show how labour market and consumption culture act as main constituent elements of the assemblage of disease in the third case. I refer again to “machinistic hum,” but now I analyse how dramaturgical and choreographic choices lead to the visibility of a depression."
Beyond the horizon(tality): Can hierarchical be horizontal?,"['Minoni, Marco']","['Kruijf, Hans de']",2022-01-01T00:00:18Z,EN,['Horizontality; Leadership; Prefiguration; Extinction Rebellion; Power; SMO.'],Cultural Anthropology: Sociocultural Transformation (res),"This research reconciles leaders(hip) and organizations with horizontality by showing that they 
give rise to hierarchies and social authorities that limit power inequalities within the movement. 
Since authorities and hierarchies are defined as un-horizontal (Juris 2008, 354), this research 
prompts for horizontality’s reconceptualization so that its practice actually limits power 
inequalities, which is ultimately horizontality’s raison d'être (Maeckelbergh, 2009, 69). By 
exploring how coordination occurs through alternative politics that redesign the way power 
operates, this research contributes to Reedy’s (2014, 639) quest for ""impossible organizing.""
Through a participatory, militant autoethnography, I unpack the practice of horizontality within 
Extinction Rebellion Netherlands (XRNL) through the lens of leadership as informed by organizational processes. First, I argue that leadership practice is inseparable from XRNL’s organization, which enables actors’ leadership practice, legitimizes a leadership practice aimed at power equalization, and distributes leadership and power across the movement. As a result, XRNL's organization does not obliterate power but instills it into formal organizational processes that give rise to collectively accepted hierarchies and social authorities that can ultimately limit power inequalities among activists. This shows facilitators' leadership figures who, being given the social authority to manage meaning and frame actors’ interactions, can exercise influence to
distributes leadership and mitigate power. However, social authority and its solidification through uneven capital distributions make it difficult to challenge powerholders and might result in power centralization, hampering horizontality. Thus, horizontality is a never-ending project requiring intentionality and continuous monitoring, or else leadership and organization can become liabilities."
"Immunohistochemical analysis to assess the effects of 
static cold storage versus hypothermic machine 
perfusion on porcine hearts","['Putten, Pepijn van der']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-01-01T00:00:27Z,EN,"['Heart transplant; hypothermic machine perfusion, static cold storage; immunohistochemistry']",Biology of Disease,"Background
Because of population ageing and a high prevalence of overweight, heart failure is a growing global 
health issue. Currently heart transplantion (HTx) is the gold standard treatment, but this treatment is 
paired with a high waiting-list mortality, partially caused by a shortage of donor hearts. One way to 
increase the donor pool would be to change the preservation of the donor hearts. A novel way to 
preserve donor hearts is hypothermic machine perfusion. In this study, the effects of the currently 
used preservation method static, cold storage and hypothermic machine perfusion on 
slaughterhouse porcine hearts have been compared using immunohistochemical analyses.
Methods
Slaughterhouse porcine hearts were removed and preserved for 4 hours using either static cold 
storage (SCS) or hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) followed by 4 hours of normothermic 
machine perfusion (NMP). At the end of the experiment, tissue samples were collected and 
aphosphotungstic acid-haematoxylin (PTAH) staining was used to score contraction band necrosis 
and erythrocyte extravasation. An active caspase-3 staining was performed to score apoptosis.
Results
After normalising the data for the survival time of the hearts, The SCS hearts showed significantly 
higher contraction band necrosis compared to HMP hearts.
Conclusion
HMP shows great potential to improve the donor pool. In this study we discovered that more 
contraction band necrosis is present in hearts that are preserved using SCS compared to HMP.
Further studies should include a higher sample size and more stainings could be performed to 
further elucidate the effects of SCS and HMP on porcine hearts"

cyclic AMP (cAMP) plays a central role in regulation of fructification, however, it remains unclear
how the intracellular cAMP concentration is regulated and how this affects fructification

by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). An attempt has been made at the deletion of the high-affinity PDE
(Pde2) of S. commune, though no transformants were obtained. Moreover, efforts were made
towards a titratable conditional gene expression in S. commune, by developing the required
constructs for the Tet-on system. In this initial setup, the reporter gene dTomato is used to show
the viability of the system in S. commune. The Tet-on system may prove useful as a novel strategy
in interference with genes, Pde2 being a prime candidate. Additionally, the use ring plates has
been introduced for phenotyping of colonies. Altogether, valuable tools have been prepared

in the Southern Pacific Ocean, close to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. It is an important
regulator of West Antarctic and Antarctic Peninsula climate with the potential to accelerate
future ice-loss, by driving atmosphere and ocean circulations. Using ERA5-reanalysis data, we
develop an ASL climatology, investigating variability in both depth and location on different
timescales. We find that the depth of the ASL is influenced by the two large-scale modes
of atmospheric variability on the Southern Hemisphere: The Southern Annular Mode (SAM)
and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Our results show that the combination of SAM+
(SAM-) and La Niña (El Niño) cause negative (positive) pressure anomalies in the Amundsen
Sea, while other combinations show significantly reduced effects. The zonal location of the ASL
is linked to the mid-tropospheric planetary waves, causing a 60◦ eastward shift during austral
summer compared to other seasons. The synoptic scale atmospheric patterns in the Amundsen-
Bellingshausen and Ross Seas are dominated by the ASL. The advection of both warm air (to
the east) and cool air (to the west) around the ASL influences the climate of West Antarctica
and the Antarctic Peninsula, creating large anomalies in temperature, precipitation and sea
ice. Using the Community Earth System Model (CESM2), we are able to asses future ASL
variability and its influence on the AIS, comparing a historical (1979-2014) and future period
(2065-2100). The modelled ASL in CESM2 matches the observations from ERA5 well. We
show that the future ASL will likely deepen as a consequence of anthropogenic forcing, further
spatially extending its influence on near-surface wind patterns over parts of East Antarctica.
While in present day climate an anomalously strong ASL has a net cooling effect on Antarctica,
in the future the area of warming response increases, especially during summer and autumn."
The role of epigenetic inheritance in the maintenance or alteration of cellular identity,"['Roest, Merel']","['Mattiroli, Francesca']",2022-01-19T00:00:27Z,EN,['Epigenetic; epigenome; posttranslational modifications; heterochromatin; euchromatin; DNA replication; cell identity; epigenetic memory; reprogramming'],"Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology","Cell identity is tightly regulated by cell-specific expression patterns. This is caused by epigenetic factors that pack the DNA into chromatin, making it accessible or inaccessible to transcription machinery. The regulation of these epigenetic factors is poorly understood, especially how this epigenetic memory is transmitted to daughter cells after mitosis. Accurate transmission of expression patterns after cell division is essential for preserving proper cell lineages. As DNA replication disrupts the chromatin structure, there must be highly regulated mechanisms involved in the restoration of chromatin. However, these mechanisms remain unclear. In this review, an overview is given of the current finding and models present in the research field of epigenetic inheritance. The focus will be on histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) as these epigenetic factors are key determinants that correlate with the chromatin state and transcriptional status. Recent studies showed that repressive PTMs are inherited by staying attached to recycled histones during DNA replication. Afterwards, positive read-write loops restore these PTMs on neighboring naïve histones. For activating PTMs more remains unclear as their attached histones are dispersed during DNA replication. Transcription initiation seems an important factor for the appropriate restoration of accessible chromatin, but furthermore the mechanisms involved remain hypothetical. PTMs are a barrier for reprogramming of cell fate as they are important factors in maintaining the cellular epigenetic memory. There are techniques that enable reprogramming of cell fate, but they have low success rates with limited possibilities. Understanding the mechanisms involved in PTM inheritance could be used to develop more efficient reprogramming techniques in the future, which will have many therapeutic benefits."

However, not only the computation steps themselves matter, but also the context in which they occur. An important example is embodiment: the influence of body shape and properties on information processing. Since a few years, research explicitly distinguishes between solid brains, consisting of sessile parts, and liquid brains with motile parts. Previous research separately examined plants and ant colonies as solid or liquid brains, respectively. This literature review directly compared these two systems to investigate how their solid or liquid embodiment shapes their distributed information processing. Key results were: there is a solid-liquid brain spectrum, which corresponds to computations using structure or movement, respectively. Developing networks must balance construction cost against transport speed within embodiment constraints. Local communication suffices for system-wide information integration and complex computations, but long-distance communication methods add signal robustness, quick responses due to shortcuts through 3D space, and enable interaction with neighbouring plants or colonies. Computational output typically modifies input of subsequent information processes, often through proprioception. Contrary to the dominant perspectives in the plant cognition debate, this research showed the existence and importance of whole-plant emergent processes, but started from the plant embodiment instead of forcing plants into a neural animal mould. In this way, new research questions arise, such as how communication delay and signal integration are affected when growth adds plant organs and increases inter-organ distance."
Investigating Colorectal Carcinoma Dependent Changes in Fucosylation of Carcinoembryogenic Antigen via Electron Transfer Dissociation in Tandem Mass Spectrometry,"['Schaijik, Dries van']","['Boons, Geert-Jan']",2022-01-19T00:00:17Z,EN,['mass; spectrometry; glycans; carcinoembryonic antigen; colorectal; carcinoma'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"In this research proposal I have written down a strategy to analyse the fucosylation pattern of the glycoprotein carcinoembryogenic antigen (CEA) originating from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) tissue and compare this to the fucosylation pattern of CEA originating from colorectal tissue of healthy individuals. The reason for investigating this is that many human fucosyltransferases are upregulated in CRC. Investigating the effect of this on CEA glycosylation could lead to new insights and medical applications regarding CRC. The primary method of analysis will be tandem mass spectrometry (MS) utilizing collision induced dissociation (CID) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD) as fragmentation methods. Several techniques will be used to isolate fucosylated structures, such as lectin affinity chromatography, facilitating analysis by MS. By analysing not only the amount of fucose present but also its different bonding conformations and the differences therein between different glycosylation sites on the protein – developing a specific and sensitive screening method for CRC might be possible. Gaining this detailed structural information is made possible by the use of ETD which has not been applied for these purposes before on glycans of this level of complexity. The diagnostic test that is the ultimate goals of this research would be in the form of a blood test which is less invasive than conventional CRC screening methods and would lead to more regular testing across the population, ultimately leading to significantly less CRC deaths."

This study’s goal is to explore and introduce elements that can improve education in COPD by making it more engaging and relevant. Having as a starting point the Self Determination Theory framework, the constructs of Autonomy, Self-efficacy, Relatedness were addressed and implemented to inform the development of mock-up screens of an educational module for a self-management app. A questionnaire evaluated these screens with questions about perceived Autonomy, Self-efficacy and Relatedness. 80 COPD patients participated in the online study. The results showed that the screens were well-received by the participants and satisfied their needs for Autonomy, Self-Efficacy and Relatedness, however further research is needed, to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed educational program.

Overcrowded Dutch natural areas: an agent-based exploration of visitor conflicts,"['Booms, Christian']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-01-14T00:00:17Z,EN,[],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"Nature-based recreation and tourism brings forward a wide variety of benefits. However, high recreational pressure can also result in various negative impacts, both on nature itself, as well as on the experiences of those visiting natural areas. Visitors can start to experience crowding, which can reduce the quality of their nature visiting experience, and visitor conflicts can be experienced. In order to facilitate sustainable nature-based recreation and tourism, organisation involved in managing natural areas therefore engage in visitor management, which aims at ensuring the quality of the visitor experience and nature itself. Visitor management is becoming increasingly important to natural areas around the world, as visitor numbers are increasing. This is also the case in the Netherlands, where an historic increase in the number of visits to natural areas has been reported since the start of the COVID19 pandemic. For visitor management to be effective, information about visitor behaviour is required. For many natural areas, it is the case that little information about visitor behaviour is known, however. Agent-based modelling allows for the estimation of visitor behaviour that is hard to measure using other methods. Many agent-based models, however, rely on the assumption that human decision-making is rational, and are not based on existing models of human psychology. The Consumat approach to simulation modelling is identified as an exception but has not been applied to the context of visitor behaviour yet. In this thesis, it is investigated how an agent-based model, based on the Consumat framework, can be used to simulate and explore the spatiotemporal behaviour of visitors in natural areas, in order to gain insights into visitor conflicts. The Amerongen Forest in the Netherlands has been selected as the research area for this thesis, and GAMA has been used to develop the model. The behaviour of hikers, cyclists, mountain bikers, and horse riders was simulated, and encounters between these different types of visitors were recorded. The model output suggests that many encounters in the research area occur near the main entrances to the area, along frequently used marked hiking trails, and near landmarks situated on these trails. Furthermore, encounters between visitors of different activity types are suggested to occur in places where there is an overlap or intersection between the networks of various activity types. The inclusion of the concepts of familiarity and satisfaction allows for the further exploration of visitor behaviour. A sensitivity analysis was performed, and scenarios were developed. Furthermore, through expert interviews, it was determined that, generally, the outcomes of the model can be regarded as plausible. However, further research, and in particular, empirical research into the behaviour of visitors in natural areas, is required in order to further calibrate and statistically validate the model."
Getting from A to B in a complex mobility implementation process,"['Vries, Torben de']","['Hurk, Martijn van den']",2022-01-14T00:00:16Z,EN,"['Sustainable mobility, Urban Mobility, Institutional mobility process']",Spatial Planning,"The growing demand for urban living has a lot of consequences for cities. As cities attract more people, more houses have to be added while available space is becoming increasingly scarce. Building dense is an often-mentioned approach to satisfy housing demands. However, cities that already suffered from a decreasing liveability, congestion and lack of green space will continue to decrease in those aspects. Private cars within cities do have a very bad influence on urban living. As the population rises, the demand for travel grows with it. In many cities however, a capacity limited is reached. In order to improve the urban quality of life and keep cities accessible, alternatives to motorised private cars are needed. Sustainable urban mobility entails a shift from car-oriented neighbourhoods towards compactly built neighbourhoods dominated by active modes, such as walking and cycling. Other alternatives to the car, are shared mobility modes, which are gaining popularity rapidly.
Many cities are starting to rethink their mobility strategy and starting to experiment with new mobilities by providing services and adapting the urban design. Also in the Netherlands, cities are starting to practise the shift as congestion problems, space scarcity and a decreasing quality of urban life are emerging. In the bigger Dutch cities, former brownfields are planned to be transformed into high-density and compact urban neighbourhoods. The neighbourhoods have a pioneer position due to their size and their ambitions on sustainable mobility as becoming almost car-free, setting up a shared mobility system following the concept of MaaS (mobility as a Service). However, the implementation of these plans is expected to be complex and full of obstacles. This research focused on the institutional and financial obstacles and the way of counteracting them in the implementation process of sustainable urban mobility in two future urban neighbourhoods: Merwede Utrecht and Sluisbuurt Amsterdam.
The research concludes that several obstacles are found in the cases of Sluisbuurt and Merwede. Although the cases did differ a lot, mostly institutional, the approach to major obstacles was comparable. The city of Amsterdam and Utrecht both took a large interest in the facilitation of mobility as a service by becoming owner of parking spaces and subsidise the still struggling private mobility providers for as long as necessary. Although a large responsibility lies with the market, municipalities are still making use of their powerful instruments to enforce a societal desired result."

The halo model uses these as building blocks of the universe, and provides an empirical method for studying its large-scale structure. However, in the standard approach, haloes are incorrectly assumed to be spherical. In this work, we study the use of the anisotropic (triaxial) halo model (AHM) for new and existing observables. This model is physically more accurate, but also presents considerable numerical difficulties due to high-dimensional integrals that need to be computed. We first consider the matter distribution through its power spectrum, computing the integrals using Monte Carlo integration. Extending previous results to higher redshifts we can calculate angular power spectra, which we use to study the effect of modelling choices on the estimate of cosmological parameters, using a Fisher matrix analysis and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We find  significant biases for using both the isotropic (spherical) and anisotropic halo models, and conclude these should not be used for the matter power spectrum. Next, we extend the AHM to predictions of intrinsic alignments (IAs) of galaxies, in order to better model aspects of the small-scale environment of haloes like the anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies. We derive analytic expressions for different correlation functions and power spectra. Due to the projection involved in observables of IA, our expressions are even more complex to compute than for matter correlations, and require further simplifications or a more efficient implementation before they can yield to computation. We suggest paths forward for these issues, and conclude with additional proposals for studying the AHM."
Setting up a cellular assay to characterize the regulation of functional docking of the proteasomal activator PA28 PA28αβ within the antigen processing pathway,"['Holtrop, Anne Floor']","['Sijts, Alice']",2022-01-18T00:00:17Z,EN,['PA28; Antigen Processing; Functional docking; IFN-γ; Phosphorylation; Optimisation'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"The proteasome activator 28 (PA28αβ) regulates both the influx of substrates through the terminal rings of the proteolytic core and the proteolytic activity of the core particle (CP). Functional docking of PA28αβ onto the CP involves 1) the physical interaction between the two complexes, and 2) the activation of the proteolytic activity of the CP. Physical docking requires the insertion of the last carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of PA28α into the outer rings of the CP. Another factor involved in docking is a phosphorylated amino acid in PA28αβ, as the dephosphorylation of this complex abolishes stimulating abilities. As phosphorylation patterns of PA28αβ change within the cell due to stimulation, the question arose if this change is used as a regulatory mechanism for docking of it onto the CP. Therefore, this study aimed to set up a cellular assay to characterize the docking behaviour of PA28αβ in murine Ana-1 macrophages. Experiments were performed using stable, monoclonal cell lines of WT, and PA28β-deficient murine macrophages, obtained by utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system and were performed in both unstimulated and interferon-gamma stimulated cells. First, the expression of both PA28αβ subunits was determined via quantitative western blot and flow cytometry analysis. Secondly, Ana-1 cells were treated with the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system. In the first way, in both wildtype and ΔPA28β Ana-1 macrophages an affinity tag was inserted at the N-terminus of the Psme1 gene, encoding for PA28α, and this was validated using flow cytometry analysis. The second way, via utilizing error-prone DNA repair, the efficiency and efficacy of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were investigated. Subsequently, genotyping was performed to validate if the designed single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeted the Cas9 enzyme to the right cutting site in Cas9-treated Ana-1 macrophages. Lastly, an immunoprecipitation protocol was partly optimised with the intention to isolate PA28αβ out of the cell to study its docking behaviour. I found that PA28β is upregulated in response to stimulation, whereas PA28α levels remain unaffected. However, the question arose about how successful stimulation of the cells had been, as the major histocompatibility complex class I levels remained unaffected too. The insertion of the affinity tag was successful, but any result was abolished after a freeze-and-thaw cycle. Lastly, immunoprecipitation remained unsuccessful and still needs several optimisation steps. Unravelling the highly complex interconnection of pathways influencing proteins' fate from synthesis to degradation is fundamental to improving our understanding of the interplay between cellular proteostasis and the immune system before we are able to specifically target it during therapy."

guidelines for XAI interfaces. A singular fully functional demo has been created based
on principles of human decision-making and usability design principles, which endured
five iterative tests by the developers of WEET. Then, the performance of the demo was
tested by conducting a cognitive walkthrough and evaluating various non-fictional
webshops on three analysts of the LMIO. The results show that applying usability
guidelines increase usability in an XAI system and applying the use of heuristics
in addition to the 80/20 rule allows for fast and accurate decisions. Designers of

Characterization of S-palmitoylation dependent protein localization by hyperplexed spatial proteomics,"['Stokkel, Marijke']","['Baggelaar, Marc']",2022-01-18T00:00:18Z,EN,"['S-palmitoylation, Palmostatin B, spatial proteomics, translocation, SILAC-TMT, higher order multiplexing']",Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"S-Palmitoylation is a post translational modification (PTM) associated with numerous cancers and
neurological diseases. It is a reversible type of lipidation defined by the addition of a palmitic acid to a
cysteine residue. Regulation of this PTM depends on the activity of palmitoyl S-acyl transferases and
palmitoyl thioesterases which add and remove the palmitoyl moiety, respectively. S-palmitoylation can
have various effects on proteins, of which a change in intracellular localization is most substantiated.
While methods for large scale identification of palmitoylated proteins have become well established, the
characterization of S-palmitoylation dependent translocations has so far only been studied on a single
protein basis. This study aimed to identify S-palmitoylation dependent translocating proteins. The broad
spectrum depalmitoylase inhibitor Palmostatin B (PalmB) was employed in combination with differential
centrifugation based spatial proteomics to determine translocating proteins. In addition, SILAC-TMT
hyperplexing was used to allow for the combined quantitation of treatment groups and spatial
proteomics fractions. Using this method we identified 48 potentially translocating proteins. A high
overrepresentation of S-palmitoylated proteins was observed among the translocators indicating that
the translocation of these enriched proteins may have occurred in response to a change in
palmitoylation. Additionally, a STRING database search found many interacting proteins within this
group suggesting that some translocations may occur as a result of the translocation of a binding
partner. We demonstrate that spatial proteomics can be used as a hypothesis-generating method to
identify potential S-palmitoylation dependent translocating proteins. These potential translocators can
be used as a starting point for further study into S-palmitoylation dependent protein localization."
Resistance Mechanisms to HER2-Targeted Therapy in Gastroesophageal Carcinoma: A Systematic Review,"['Blangé, Dionne']","['Kranenburg, Onno']",2022-01-19T00:00:17Z,EN,['systematic review; resistance; esophageal adenocarcinoma; HER2; Trastuzumab'],"Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology","Ieder jaar wordt er bij meer dan één miljoen mensen maag- of slokdarmkanker gediagnostiseerd. Voor

Westerse landen komt vooral het type ‘adenocarcinoom’ voor, een vorm van kanker bestaande uit 
klierweefsel. De laatste jaren stijgt de incidentie van maag/slokdarmkanker, maar door late diagnose 
en beperkte behandelopties zijn de overlevingskansen laag. Tussen de 7 en 43% van de 
maag/slokdarmkanker patiënten heeft verhoogde expressie van de HER2 receptor, ook wel HER2-
positief genoemd. Deze receptor speelt een belangrijke rol in signaalcascades die betrokken zijn bij 
proliferatie, differentiatie, celdood, adhesie en migratie van cellen. Door verhoogde HER2 expressie, 
verkrijgen tumorcellen eigenschappen die tumorgroei kunnen bevorderen. Daarom zijn er meerdere 
medicijnen ontwikkeld die de HER2 receptor en zijn signaalcascades remmen, bijvoorbeeld 
trastuzumab, pertuzumab en lapatinib. Helaas blijken tumoren resistent te kunnen zijn of worden. In

is het meeste onderzoek uitgevoerd in cellijnen of muismodellen. In de literatuur staat beschreven dat 
veranderingen van de HER2 receptor zelf (zoals mutaties), verhoogde expressie van andere receptoren

"The origin of SARS-CoV-2: how, where and when did the virus emerge?","['Schutte, Miriam']","['Kuppeveld, Frank van']",2022-01-15T00:00:16Z,EN,"['SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, origin, zoonosis, laboratory']",Infection and Immunity,"The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has been holding the whole world in its grip for almost two years. Soon after the initial reports of an unknown lung disease, the cause was identified to be a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic has influenced billions of lives, causing millions of deaths worldwide and the numbers are still rising. In order to prevent a virus outbreak with such global impact in the future, it is crucial to gain more knowledge about how viruses emerge in the human population. If the factors that influence the introduction of novel viruses to humans are known, we might be able to stop the emergence of novel viruses by intervening with these factors. The aim of this paper is to increase the understanding of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 by providing a thorough, unbiased review of the current literature on this topic. Three aspects of the virus’ origin are discussed: how, where and when this virus was introduced in the human population. Two main routes of emergence of the virus are currently being considered: through nature or in a laboratory. Previous coronavirus outbreaks in human history have been linked to animal-to-human transmission and hence have a natural origin, with bats being the most prevalent animal source. While related viruses have been found in nature, no animal source has yet been identified for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the unique features that are seen in the SARS-CoV-2 genome urge scientists to reconsider a laboratory origin of the virus. Several laboratories across the world have been working on coronaviruses for decades and state-of-the-art experimental techniques allow researchers to create viruses without leaving any traces of it being unnatural. Regarding the initial location and timing of the virus’ emergence, the consensus is that the pandemic began in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Outside of China, however, investigations from Europe and America have reported the prevalence of the virus before that period. These reports raise the question whether SARS-CoV-2 could have originated outside of China before December 2019. Overall, it is clear that the origins of SARS-CoV-2 remain a point of discussion. The literature overview and in-depth discussion presented here forms a basis for further research into the origin of SARS-CoV-2. With this study, we hope to contribute to increasing the preparedness for future virus outbreaks to prevent our lives from ever being locked-down again."
‘We are nothing without nature’- The emotional resonance of far-right ecologist online content in public Telegram channels,"['Heinrich, Abra']","['Fumerton, Mario']",2022-01-08T00:00:19Z,EN,['far-right ecologism; FRE; ecofascism; far-right; extremism; emotions; frame theory; contextual shifts; emotional resonance; Telegram; white supremacy; pine trees; radicalization; recruitment; terrorism;'],Conflict Studies and Human Rights,"Recently, ecofascism, a radical environmentalist ideology often associated with (Neo-)Nazis, has regained popular interest following several right-wing extremist terrorist attacks  (Christchurch (2019) and El Paso (2019)) after which the attackers cited the ideology as a motivation. In both cases, online platforms played a role as sources of radical ideas, and in general, there is an established link between extremist online forums and offline violence. Given the renewed relevance of ecofascism as a motivator for violence, this thesis aims to understand how ecofascist groups of the far-right achieve emotional resonance with their audience by using a centuries-old ideology. The aim is to contribute towards an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ecofascist thought that explain its appeal and ability to motivate violence. To address this question, this thesis will conduct a qualitative case study analysis on far-right environmentalist Telegram channels using a 
 snowballing sampling method. In order to identify relevant content, this thesis will operationalize the far-right ecologism (FRE) framework. The FRE framework will also be used to code the sample according to an interpretative theme. Additionally, frame analysis, and the sensitizing concepts of emotional resonance and contextual shifts are used to address how an interplay of framings, appeals to emotions, and a global context characterized by environmental crises may contribute towards the resonance of ecofascist content. The thesis concludes that an important component of the emotional resonance of far-right ecologist content is the way posts not only associate nature with white supremacist ideology, but also how they connect these themes to a global, changing context characterized by environmental crises. This interplay of ideas aims to create a larger, emotional impact on their audience. The relevance of this insight is that the strategic use of themes of
environmental crises by the far-right might serve as a new entry point to extremist ideologies and aid the recruitment of new members, especially those already concerned over environmental degradation."

Social and cognitive patterns in science: An evolutionary approach to explore mechanisms of cumulative advantages and knowledge accumulation,"['Westerdijk, Wouter']","['Heimeriks, Gaston']",2022-01-08T00:00:18Z,EN,['Matthew effect; cumulative advantage; inequality; organisational structure; sociology of science; evolutionary economics; scientometrics; knowledge production'],Innovation Sciences,"Introduction: The Matthew effect is a cumulative advantage mechanism in the scientific system. This implies that successful scientists have an increased chance to become more successful, as they generally have gained more recognition, easier access to resources and funding, increased productivity, and are more likely to have their articles published. High status scientists have accrued power and influence on the scientific search regimes. Science is found to comprise strong social hierarchies. As the spread of knowledge is affected by social status and cognitive similarity, the interest of this exploratory research is to examine the relation between social inequalities and cognitive inequalities within scientific fields over time. Cognitive inequality implies that the focus of research is unevenly distributed over the subtopics of a scientific field.
Literature: Cumulative advantage mechanisms are linked to evolutionary economics. It is argued that scientists are subjected to selection pressures and seek to provide contributions to the scientific field as success in order to ‘survive’. Contributions are considered novel and valuable knowledge combinations, which are retained also by other scientists as such combinations have proven to be successful. Additionally, the scientists who successfully contributed will receive recognition, which increases their chances for survival. Selection pressures urge scientists to avoid taking risks, which implies that they stick close to previous successes, such as contributions of highly recognised scientists or contributions with which they have been recognised. It is therefore hypothesized that scientific fields show an increase in social inequality and cognitive inequality over time, and that the increase of inequality differs for the amount of selection pressures present in a specific field.
Method: Four scientific fields with different selection pressures are compared based on publication data from articles published between 1980 - 2012 with an increment of two years. The inequality of citations among scientists, articles and keywords is calculated over the years using the Gini coefficient. This also applies to the inequality of productivity. Additionally, the statistics of the collaboration networks among scientists and keyword co-occurrences per year are calculated and compared.
Results: All fields show increasing inequalities in the social and cognitive domain. Fields have sublinear correlations of inequality with the number of annual publications.
Conclusion/Discussion: The annual productivity of the field showed the strongest correlations with both social and cognitive inequality. Each scientific field showed distinct inequality patterns. It is discussed how inequality and cumulative advantage mechanisms in evolutionary theory relate."

Understanding the complement resistance mechanisms of Klebsiella pneumoniae,"['Siemerink, Ruben']","['Bardoel, Bart']",2022-01-07T00:00:16Z,EN,['Klebsiella pneumoniae; Complement resistance; Capsule; O-antigen'],Infection and Immunity,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is een bacterie die wordt beschouwd als een grote bedreiging voor de volksgezondheid vanwege een grote toename in antibiotica resistentie. Normaal gesproken wordt K. pneumoniae gedood door het immuun systeem, maar in personen met een zwakkere gezondheid vaak niet. K. pneumoniae heeft namelijk verschillende mechanismen ontwikkeld om het immuun systeem van mensen te ontwijken.

Een belangrijk onderdeel van het immuunsysteem is het complement systeem en dit dient als een soort van verdedigingslinie voor bacteriën zoals K. pneumoniae. Het complementsysteem bestaat uit een netwerk van eiwitten die op een gecoördineerde manier samenwerken. Het systeem wordt geactiveerd na herkenning van bepaalde patronen op de bacterie. Vervolgens wordt er een kettingreactie veroorzaakt die er uiteindelijk voor kan zorgen dat de bacteriën gedood worden. De bacterie kan op twee verschillende manieren gedood worden. Ten eerste kunnen er bepaalde complement eiwitten op de bacterie worden geplakt. Deze eiwitten kunnen worden herkent door immuun cellen, waarna deze cellen de bacteriën ‘opeten’. De andere manier is dat er vijf verschillende complement eiwitten een complex gaan vormen op het membraan van de bacterie. Dit complex maakt een gat in het membraan van de bacterie, waardoor deze uit elkaar valt en uiteindelijk dood gaat. Echter heeft K. pneumoniae verschillende mechanismen ontwikkelt waardoor deze bacterie het complement systeem kan ontwijken. Het doel van deze studie is om een uitgebreid overzicht te geven van de diverse complement-ontwijkingsstrategieën van K. pneumoniae.

De belangrijkste strategieën zijn het hebben van een capsule en LPS. De capsule is een dikke suiker laag die om de bacterie heen zit. Deze laag zorgt ervoor dat de complement eiwitten niet goed kunnen binden op het membraan van de bacterie. Hierdoor kan er geen porie worden gevormd in het membraan van de bacterie en dus wordt deze niet gedood. LPS is een belangrijk bestanddeel van de buitenmembraan van K. pneumoniae. LPS bestaat uit drie verschillende delen, waaronder het O-antigeen. Er zijn tweede types LPS, LPS met O-antigeen LPS zonder O-antigeen. Over het algemeen worden bacteriën zonder O-antigen moeilijker gedood door het complement systeem dan bacteriën met O-antigeen. Het O-antigeen zorgt er namelijk voor de complement eiwitten te ver van het buitenmembraan binden en daardoor kan de porie niet in het membraan gevormd worden.

K. pneumoniae gebruikt dus voornamelijk de capsule en LPS om doding door het complementsysteem te voorkomen. De capsule en LPS zorgen er enerzijds voor dat er mindercomplement eiwitten kunnen binden en anderzijds dat de complement eiwitten te ver van het membraan binden, waardoor de porie niet in het membraan gevormd kan worden. De exacte mechanismen blijver echter enigszins onbekend. Het is belangrijk om er achter te komen hoe K. pneumoniae het complement systeem ontwijkt. Hierdoor kunnen we therapieën ontwikkelen om doding van deze bacteriën door het complement systeem te verbeteren."
Genotype-matching NGS analyses in the Princess Máxima Centre: Future Proof?,"['Huijer, Cyriel']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-01-01T00:00:31Z,EN,['Bioinformatics; Next Generation Sequencing; Genotype Matching'],Drug Innovation,"Nowadays, in a research hospital such as the Princess Máxima Centre (PMC), research and patient treatment is often substantiated on NGS data. Therefore, quality control of patient data is vital to preserve data integrity. However, several steps of the process from patient to genotype are vulnerable to sample swaps. For this purpose, NGSCheckMate was presented, a tool which retrospectively checks whether samples are labelled correctly based on a set of 21K SNPs. Nevertheless, running NGSCheckMate utilising the original 21K SNP set was found to be computationally inefficient in the PMC, with runtimes of patient samples adding up to ~68 hours. Moreover, data coming out of the PMC biobank sequencing pipeline was observed not to be compatible with NGSCheckMate as no integration of RNA-Seq with W[GX]S was achieved, even though samples were obtained from the same biomaterial. By selection of SNPs based on variety in minor allele and coverage across RNA-Seq samples, smaller SNP sets were created that maintained and improved performance compared to the original 21K set. Total runtime of NGSCheckMate was decreased from ~68 to ~2 hours. Furthermore, in combination with pre-processing and additional filtering of low-quality files, RNA-Seq integration was improved. In conclusion, this study presents a range of smaller SNP sets that both decrease runtime and improve performance of NGSCheckMate in sample swap detection."

Trained immunity vaccines: BCG as a tool to combat SARS-CoV-2 and future pandemics,"['Brand, Marina']","['Koenderman, L.']",2022-01-28T00:00:28Z,EN,['Trained immunity; innate immune memory; BCG; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19'],Infection and Immunity,"It was long assumed that immunological memory is exclusively a hallmark of adaptive immunity. However, it was recently discovered that the innate immune system has memory properties, termed ‘trained immunity’. Trained immunity is defined by long-term functional, metabolic, and epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells, resulting in an altered, often enhanced response to subsequent infection. Some existing vaccines can induce trained immunity, like the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Among these vaccines, trained immunity properties of the BCG vaccine are the most extensively studied. BCG induces trained immunity by inducing a shift in cellular metabolism towards glycolysis, and by inducing genetic alterations that promote the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells. Moreover, BCG induces immune tolerance by promoting the activation of immunosuppressive T cells (Tregs). BCG might therefore offer protection against heterologous infections, while modulating its induced immune response and preventing hyperinflammation. Indeed, the BCG vaccine was shown to offer heterologous protection against infection by a wide range of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. Recent epidemiological studies implicate that BCG (re)vaccination also offers protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and disease morbidity and mortality. In the light of these findings, this thesis discusses the concept and mechanisms of trained immunity, the molecular mechanisms of BCG-induced trained immunity, and the potential of trained immunity vaccines as preventive measure or treatment during the current pandemic and those that are yet to come."

The present longitudinal study tested whether the use of social media actually affects adolescents’ school results, and further investigated whether this relationship can be explained by an increase in attention problems and/or sleep problems. A total of 1038 adolescents (M age: 14.5, 48.3% male) completed the questionnaire of the Digital Youth Project twice, with an interval of one year. In line with expectations, the findings indicate that social media use has a negative effect on the subsequent adolescents’ school results. Although social media use seems to increase attention problems, and attention problems are associated with lowered school performance, there is little evidence that attention problems would mediate the impact of social media use on adolescents’ school performances. Moreover, no evidence was found that the effect of social media use on school grades would be due to an increase in sleep problems. Future research should further investigate the mechanisms through which social media use influences school performances, in order to develop effective prevention and intervention programs."

In addition, the intervention was associated with a higher motivation to change one’s smartphone use. Furthermore, the moderation effect implied that students who were more compliant showed less PS T2/SDS T2. In supporting students to change their smartphone use the intervention should be disseminated."

Increasing the knowledge on these relationships could prove valuable in the efficiency of identifying vulnerability following job loss and in the implementation of suitable interventions to prevent the development of CG. Neuroticism as a personality trait was hypothesized to have a positive relationship to CG, while self-efficacy as a personal resource, on the other hand, was hypothesized to have a negative relationship to CG. Moreover, it was expected of those characteristics to both have a significant relationship with CG levels when measured together. The design of the study was cross-sectional, with the use of three questionnaires in online safe environment. Τhe final sample consisted of 79 Greek individuals who had lost their jobs in the last five years. The data were analyzed using simple linear regression for the first two hypotheses and multiple regression for the last hypothesis. Results confirmed the two first hypotheses; neuroticism was found to have a positive significant relationship to CG and self-efficacy was found to have a negative significant relationship to CG. Yet, results showed no evidence for the last hypothesis, since neither neuroticism nor self-efficacy contributed to CG when measured in the same model. Further research could investigate more personality traits in order to better and more widely comprehend the development and maintenance of CG, as well as identify more resources that could act as protective factors."

Substance use brings a heightened risk for mental and physical health problems, therefore it is crucial to understand what factors associate with substance use in order to improve substance use interventions. One factor that has shown to be associated with substance use is loneliness. Previous research on this association is mostly focused on adults. Therefore, this thesis aimed to examine if there is an association between loneliness and substance use in adolescence, by using data from the MASLO-project. The associations (N = 31) between loneliness and substance use were investigated with a random-effects meta-analysis. The results of this analysis showed no significant relationship between loneliness and substance use (p = .265). In addition to the direct association between loneliness and substance use, the moderating factors age, sex and type of substance use were examined. These results showed no significant effect of the moderators on the association between substance use and loneliness. This study shows that although loneliness and substance use are both common in adolescence, no association is found between the two variables, which indicates that these are separate occurrences during adolescence and are not significantly related to each other."

The data set of the Digital Youth Project was used to answer the research question. A non-significant longitudinal relationship between higher levels of FOMO and higher levels of depressive symptoms was found. However, higher levels of FOMO was found to be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms in cross-sectional data. Nevertheless, a significant longitudinal association was found between higher levels of social comparison and higher levels of depressive symptoms. Additionally, findings showed that higher levels of FOMO were related to higher levels of SMSRF, which in turn were related to higher levels of depressive symptoms. These results contribute to understanding the underlying mechanisms that could lead to depression in adolescence."
The Influence of Varying Degrees of Activation and Working Memory Taxation of an Aversive Memory combined with a Dual-task on the Emotionality and Vividness of this Aversive Memory,"['Moorrees, Jonna']","['Matthijssen, S.J.M.A.']",2022-01-28T00:00:30Z,EN,[],Clinical Psychology,"Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a well-established therapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). EMDR is characterized by a dual-task approach: The patient holds a traumatic memory in mind while simultaneously making voluntary eye movements, resulting in reduced vividness and emotionality of the traumatic memory. This study investigated whether increasing the activation of a negative memory would improve the effectiveness of a single session in reducing vividness and emotionality of the negative memory in a non-clinical population. Participants were assigned over four conditions. Emotionality and vividness were measured before and after the test phase. Treatment acceptability was measured with a self-reported questionnaire. Surprisingly, we found that varying degrees of activation and working memory (WM) taxation did not influence the reduction of emotionality upon recollection of the memory. The results indicated that the condition with extra activation, by means of a screenshot of the aversive memory, did not outperform the other conditions in reducing vividness. Furthermore, the results indicated that the conditions that involved both WM taxation and recalling of the aversive memory were more effective in reducing vividness than the conditions that involved either only recalling of the aversive memory or only performing a dual-task. These findings support the WM theory, such that WM taxation while recalling an aversive memory decreases vividness. The treatment was evaluated as moderately acceptable. More research is needed to investigate the effect of treatment acceptability on effectiveness."
Belgian-Dutch cross-border governance: the reasons behind low levels of cross-border mobility.,"['Stepanov, Igor']","['Witte, Patrick']",2022-01-01T00:00:18Z,EN,['regional governance; cross-border governance; cross-border cooperation; border regions'],Spatial Planning,"This master thesis investigates the topic of cross-border governance and cross-border labour mobility in the border area Flanders-Netherlands. This is one of many border regions identified within the EU, which receive additional financing provided through the Interreg program to facilitate the development of the border area and contribute to the goals of Cohesion Policy.
Regional governance is different in cross-border areas due to the different environment it has to be organised in. Therefore, this thesis aims to research what the exact differences are, as well as how they can potentially hamper cooperation, and what can be done about it. An analytical framework is presented that is used to assess current state and perspectives of the Belgian-Dutch border region. For the empirical analysis, various documents have been analysed and stakeholder interviews have been conducted. The former will provide a better understanding of the higher government tiers on the cross-border matters in general and in region specifically. The latter will allow to collect more detailed insights and views on the cross-border region from the practitioners on the lower levels of government. 
This thesis will conclude that, in general, cross-border governance is hard to organise and perform, as it presents many unique challenges rooting from the nature of cross-border cooperation. There are many obstacles which can stay in the way of successful development, and the case of cross-border cooperation in the region of the Belgian-Dutch border is not an exemption. However, opportunities for more deep cooperation and integration are also present and can be seized to promote additional development in the area. Cross-border region development is important not only because it contributes to equal growth and cohesion, but also because such areas play a critical role in the economy and future of the EU."
Cholesterol metabolism in T cells in health and disease,"['Kool, Willy']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-01-11T00:00:16Z,EN,['cholesterol; T cells; hypercholesterolemia; Tangier; Smith-Lemli-Opitz'],Biology of Disease,"Cholesterol is present in almost all eukaryotic cells and has many functions in health and disease. One of the cell types influenced by cholesterol are T cells. The aim of this review is to discuss the physiological and pathophysiological effects of cholesterol metabolism on T cell function and to provide an overview of the existing knowledge gaps. 
Cholesterol plays an important role in T cells by contributing to T cell activation and proliferation and determining T cell differentiation. Indeed, while differentiation of T helper (Th)1 cells, Th17 cells, γδT cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and CD4+ memory T cells is stimulated by an active intracellular cholesterol biosynthesis, Th2 cells and CD8+ memory T cells require a suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Differentiation of regulatory T (Treg) cells from naive T cells requires low cholesterol biosynthesis, while reactivation of Tregs is stimulated by an active flux of the biosynthesis pathway. Diseases in which cholesterol metabolism is disrupted display an altered T cell profile. This contributes to clinical symptoms in for example hypercholesterolemia, Tangier disease, and Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome patients. 
One of the biggest knowledge gaps on cholesterol metabolism in T cells is the relative contribution of cholesterol uptake, biosynthesis, efflux, and esterification on T cell function in health and disease. It also remains to be understood whether cholesterol biosynthesis and lipoprotein uptake are redundant mechanisms and in which way cholesterol esterification and uptake influence T cell function. Other outstanding questions include the mechanisms behind a reliance on cholesterol biosynthesis, the effects of statins on T cells, and the translation of results obtained in mice to humans.
Unravelling the full picture of cholesterol metabolism in T cells will aid in the understanding of diseases with a disrupted T cell homeostasis, as well as to the development of efficient therapies."

recent improvements of sequencing technologies, SVs are conceived as a hallmark of cancer, and the
molecular mechanisms underlying their oncogenic potential are being uncovered. SVs can alter cancer-related gene expression by disrupting the gene sequence, inducing copy number variations or forming fusion
genes. Recently, 3D-genome organization has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of
gene expression and the formation of genomic rearrangements. Disrupting genome structural organization,
mainly topologically associating domains (TADs), can also trigger the activation of oncogenes and the onset
of cancer. This review provides general insights into the current knowledge on SVs, including their formation,
their significance in carcinogenesis, state-of-the-art detection methods and their relevance in the clinic,
highlighting their potential implementation in early diagnosis and personalized medicine."

during development and adulthood. A specific type of interpersonal touch that is experienced as pleasant 
is affective touch (AT), which is characterized by slow stroking. On the contrary, non-affective touch 
(non-AT) is perceived as less pleasant than AT and is characterized by fast stroking. In the current study, 
meta-analyses were performed with the aim of quantifying the difference in perceived pleasantness 
between AT and non-AT in healthy adults. In addition, several moderators were identified to assess 
what factors would influence the perceived pleasantness of AT. Results showed that AT is perceived as 
more pleasant than non-AT. Moreover, mean pleasantness ratings were calculated for both AT and nonAT, which can be used in future research to make comparisons. These mean pleasantness ratings are 
baseline ratings of pleasantness, as no studies were included that assessed the pleasantness of (non-)AT
during the performance of a task. More importantly, these baseline ratings can be considered as a 
baseline on how people perceived (non-)AT before the COVID-19 pandemic, which gives some 
interesting starting points for future research. Finally, the current study gave insight into methodological 
aspects that could influence the perceived pleasantness of AT. Even though some limitations have to be 
taken into account when interpreting the results of the current study, it contributed to a broader 
knowledge on the perception of AT."

Allopurinol is a parasitistatic drug which is known to interfere with the purine metabolism of the dog, causing xanthinuria as a side effect. Few studies are conducted investigating xanthinuria in dogs with CanL. Aim of this research was to determine the incidence of xanthinuria and find possible correlations with dosage, length of treatment, specific gravity and pH in dogs with CanL. Another aim was to investigate the effect of storage time on xanthinuria. The final aim was to investigate the incidence of xanthine-uroliths.
Material and methods – Prospective study: Urine samples of client-owned dogs with CanL receiving allopurinol treatment were collected and limited urinalysis including specific gravity, pH and sediment analysis was performed within 3 hours after sample collection. Urinalysis was repeated after 24h and 48h.  Retrospective study: Medical records of 145 dogs with CanL were retrospectively reviewed. Dogs were included if medical records reported at least one complete urinalysis performed during allopurinol treatment. In order to investigate the incidence of xanthine-uroliths, all included dogs were screened on reports of abdominal ultrasounds performed during allopurinol treatment. 
Results – Prospective study: A total of 10 dogs were included in this study. Six out of 10 dogs (60%) presented with xanthinuria. Minimum dosage of allopurinol and minimum length of treatment resulting in xanthinuria was 16,2 mg/kg/day and 68 days, respectively. There was a correlation found between dosage and incidence of xanthinuria (p=0,015). Strong correlations were found for both specific gravity and pH between day 1, 2 and 3 (p=<0,001 for all). Amount of xanthine was significantly different between day 1 – day 2 (p=0,047) and day 1 – day 3 (p=0,031). Retrospective study: A total of 57 dogs were included in this study. Thirty-three out of 57 dogs (58%) presented with xanthinuria during at least one urinalysis. Minimum dosage of allopurinol and length of treatment resulting in xanthinuria was 15 mg/kg/day and 13 days, respectively. Xanthinuria was present in 59/155 urinalyses (38%) performed during allopurinol treatment. A strong correlation was found between specific gravity and incidence of xanthinuria (p<0,001). Fifteen out of 57 dogs (26%) had reports of abdominal ultrasounds during allopurinol treatment. Xanthine-uroliths were reported in 12/15 dogs (80%) with ultrasound reports and clinical signs developed in 5/12 dogs (43%) with xanthine-uroliths.
Conclusions – An incidence of xanthinuria of 58-60% was found in this research, although an incidence of 45-55% is presumably more accurate. Because of the strong correlation between specific gravity and incidence of xanthinuria, stimulation of water intake is recommended. Because storage time significantly affected the incidence and amount of xanthine, xanthinuria present in stored samples should be re-evaluated in fresh urine. Because 80% of dogs with ultrasound reports presented with xanthine-uroliths and 43% of dogs with xanthine-uroliths on ultrasound developed clinical signs due to these uroliths, this study strongly encourages clinicians to perform an abdominal ultrasound if xanthinuria is detected."
"Moral decision-making and moral reasoning in Korsakoff’s Syndrome patients: an explorative study on the mediating effects of empathy, cognitive flexibility and premorbid delinquency","['Vlot, Nairobi']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-01-12T00:00:17Z,EN,"[""Korsakoff's syndrome; Moral decision-making; Moral Reasoning; Delinquency""]",Neuropsychology,"Objective. Korsakoff’s syndrome (KS) is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder, caused by a vitamin B1 insufficiency. It is characterized by psychiatric and (socio-)cognitive impairments, such as poor empathy and cognitive flexibility, often leading to difficult social interactions and behavioral regulation. Moral behaviors and attitudes may provide insight in such socio-behavioral interactions. Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate moral reasoning and moral decision-making in KS patients and explore potential associations with empathy, cognitive flexibility and premorbid behavior. Methods. In an experimental design, 20 patients diagnosed with KS and 20 gender, age- and education-matched healthy participants took part in tests assessing emotion recognition, cognitive flexibility, premorbid delinquency, moral decision-making and moral reasoning. Everyday moral dilemmas were provided by the Moral Behavior Inventory (MBI). For the purpose of evaluating own versus others’ moral behaviors, dilemmas were rewrited and presented three times, varying in personal perspective: self, personal other and unpersonal other. Moral reasoning was measured according to the developmental stages of Kohlberg. Empathy was assessed by the Emotion Recognition Test (ERT), cognitive flexibility by the D-KEFS Color Word Interference Test (CWIT) and BADS Rule Shift Cards Test. An indication of premorbid delinquent behavior was obtained by the Delinquency Questionnaire, a novel self-report questionnaire specifically designed for the current study. Results. We observed an utilitarian bias in KS patients, demonstrated by their moral decision-making and moral reasoning maturity. Cognitive flexibility, emotion recognition and perspective-taking were decreased in KS patients, but self-reported delinquency was higher. Moral reasoning maturity was lower in KS patients and correlated negatively with the extent of premorbid delinquency and not with cognitive abilities. Conclusion. Moral decision-making and moral reasoning maturity is lower in KS patients and might be responsible for difficulties in adequately engaging in social situations and -relations. It could find its origin already before the onset of the KS diagnosis, as suggested by the elevated premorbid levels of delinquent behavior."

BMLs have taken up a central presence in many different diseases affecting the musculoskeletal system, including the spine. As the condition of the spine is of strong influence to the overall body’s health, detection and characterization of BMLs could help in preventing the progression of spine related diseases. With the increased clinical availability of dual energy computed tomography (DECT), an alternative method for imaging of BMLS has presented itself through virtual non-calcium (VNCa) techniques. In this paper we explore the current state of both imaging modalities for (semi-)automatic segmentation of BMLs in the spine, as well as a variety of approaches to the segmentation of individual vertebrae that could be used to develop a fully automated process for BML segmentation. We found that for
both MRI and DECT, automatic BML segmentation is still in its infancy, with few studies attempting the task. Additionally, manual segmentations of BMLs, which act as the ground truth for evaluating automated approaches, generally show significant inter- and intraobserver variability. However, with CT being the modality of choice in the traumatic setting, its potential for further developments in material decomposition and various
other advantages that DECT poses over MRI, DECT could become the future modality of choice in both qualitative and quantitative imaging of BMLS."

are challenging to acquire for the domain-specific classes. Recently, research has investigated the possibility of
learning visual features with natural language supervision by using image captioning as a pre-training task for
visual backbones. This study investigates the possibility of pre-training with domain-specific image-captions to
learn domain-specific visual features. We pre-train convolutional neural networks from scratch, using a militaryspecific image-caption dataset (Janes Captions) collected for this study. The effect of different image captioning pre-training tasks on the learning of the visual features was also evaluated. Although these models did not outperform the current state-of-the-art methods, they outperformed models pre-trained on similar amounts of
generic image-captions. Ultimately, natural language supervision for pre-training visual models is a promising
concept that, if applied correctly, could solve the problems of current state-of-the-art methods, especially for
application in specific domains."

Environmental concerns of employees are expected to have a positive effect on environmental performance (Temminck, Mearns & Fruhen, 2015; Yusliza, Ramayah, Faezah & Khalid, 2020) and that this effect is mediated by OCBE. Subsequently, the social exchange theory (SET) expects perceived organizational support for environmental behavior (POSE) to have a positive effect on environmental performance (Darolia, Kumari & Darolia, 2010) and that this effect is also mediated by OCBE (Netra, & Sintaasih, 2019). This study attempts to answer the following question: i.e., can high levels of involvement in environmental sustainability increase employee’s OCBE and environmental performance? To answer this question, an online questionnaire has been set out among Dutch employees (N = 128). As expected, environmental concern increases OCBE and OCBE increases environmental performance. Moreover, OCBE mediates the relationship between environmental concerns and environmental performance. Unexpectedly, POSE does not influence OCBE, nor environmental performance. Similarly, no mediation effect of POSE via OCBE on environmental performance was found. To improve an organizations’ environmental performance, it is advised to transform the environmental concern of employees into OCBE in the workplace."

Methods: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, patients who received CCTA followed by FFR-CT (FFR-CT group) and patients who received CCTA without FFR-CT before FFR-CT was available (CCTA group) were compared. Included patients had ≥1 anatomically significant stenosis on CCTA. Primary outcome was the rate of MACCE after one year. Secondary outcomes were invasive coronary angiography- (ICA) and revascularization rates. Hazard ratio (HR) for MACCE was calculated. Secondary outcomes were compared using the Pearson chi-square test.
Results: A total of 360 participants (FFR-CT group n=136, CCTA group n=224, mean age 59.4 years, 52.8% men) were analyzed. The rate of MACCE was low (n=11 events in 10 participants(2.8%)) and consisted of myocardial infarctions (n=7) and strokes (n=4).

contact met de overheid uiteen te zetten. Hiervoor is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: Welke 
communicatieproblemen ervaren mbo-studenten in contact met de overheid? Om deze vraag te 
beantwoorden, is een kwalitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd waarvoor semigestructureerde interviews zijn 
afgenomen bij 17 mbo-studenten en 3 professionals. Uit de resultaten bleek dat de studenten 
problemen ervoeren met de informatievoorziening en de bereikbaarheid van de Belastingdienst en 
DUO. Verder hadden zij geldzorgen door slechte informatievoorziening over financiële zaken. Ook 
ervoeren zij een stigma vanuit de maatschappij en de overheid op mbo-studenten. Bovendien vonden 
zij de communicatie over de overheidsmaatregelen om de gevolgen van corona te beperken
benedenmaats. De conclusie is daarom dat de overheid voornamelijk op het punt van 
informatievoorziening en de manier van communiceren haar communicatie richting de groep mbostudenten kan verbeteren. Een mogelijke kanttekening aan dit onderzoek is dat de resultaten uit het 
onderzoek niet te generaliseren zijn, doordat er gebruik is gemaakt van een kleine steekproef. De 
resultaten van dit onderzoek helpen de NO om de focus te bepalen voor hun toekomstige onderzoeken

Initial-State-Based Resimulation (ISBR), where we resimulate after changing the initial state. We
construct one GBR method, namely G, where the goal is set to be the last state of the resimulated
episode. G is shown to enable solving tasks that are neither solvable by using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [Schulman et al., 2017], an Intrinsic Curiosity module (ICM) [Pathak et al., 2017]
nor Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) [Andrychowicz et al., 2017]. We construct 2 ISBR methods, namely S+ and S−. Both methods process the advantage estimates to determine swing events,
periods with high amplitude advantage estimates. S+ and S− then resimulate successes and mistakes, respectively, by setting the initial states to be the states at the start of swing events. All
methods are tested on two tasks that only differed in the level of sparsity, and 3 reward ratios,
controlling for the extent with which the ICM was used. The performance is measured in the solve
rate and the learning speed. We find that
• G enables solving the proposed tasks.
• S+ improves the solve rate, but only on sufficiently sparse tasks and when using ICM.
• S− improves both the solve rate and the learning speed.
• G, S+ and S− can be used in unison to create a better combined algorithm."

By drawing upon the definitional ambiguity of the concept and its relation to the core principles of sustainable development, this thesis concludes that the values of economic, environmental and social proliferation need to be included in the policy development of the circular economy. Without it, the system will never become truly cyclical nor deliver its promised results. It will solely remain a cyclical movement of waste around the globe afflicting damage on its way."

verhogen en de risico-inschatting van waarschuwingen verhogen. Dit wordt gedaan voor drie 
toepassingen medicijninformatie: de bijsluiter, een webtekst en een bijsluitersamenvatting, van twee 
medicijnen: simvastatine en ciprofloxacine.
De pictogrammen zijn een binnen-proefpersoon element in het experiment. De toepassingen 
worden tussen proefpersonen gevarieerd. 226 respondenten hebben deelgenomen aan de online 
vragenlijst in Qualtrics. Elke respondent leest twee teksten en beantwoordt bijbehorende vragen. Eén
tekst met pictogrammen van het ene medicijn, één tekst zonder pictogrammen van het andere 
medicijn. Het onderzoek bestaat uit drie deelstudies: voor elke toepassing medicijninformatie worden 
het begrip, de waardering en de risico-inschatting gemeten. Begrip wordt gemeten met begripsvragen 
die de respondent naast de tekst beantwoordt. Waardering wordt bevraagd op drie constructen: 
begrijpelijkheid, aantrekkelijkheid en overzichtelijkheid van de tekst. Waardering en risico-inschatting 
geven respondenten aan per waarschuwing op een 7 puntenschaal.
De resultaten tonen geen pictogrameffect op begrip voor de bijsluitersamenvatting. Alle vragen 
worden door de meerderheid van de respondenten correct beantwoord. De pictogrammen verhogen 
de begrijpelijkheid, aantrekkelijkheid én de overzichtelijkheid van de tekst in de bijsluitersamenvatting. 
Het pictogrameffect in deze toepassing is voor de tekst van ciprofloxacine groter dan voor simvastatine.
Bij de webtekst geldt ook dat de begripsvragen grotendeels correct beantwoord worden en er 
nauwelijks pictogrameffecten optreden. Alleen het onderwerp ‘medicijn innemen met/zonder voedsel’ 
wordt verwarrend door het toevoegen van het pictogram in de webtekst. Het pictogram verhoogt het 
begrip van de webtekst hier niet. Er wordt voor waardering in de webtekst alleen een pictogrameffect 
gevonden op aantrekkelijkheid.
De resultaten van de bijsluiter tonen wederom geen begripseffecten. In deze en andere 
toepassingen blijkt wel dat het pictogram over grapefruit beter een verbod kan uitstralen dan een 
waarschuwing, hier is de goedscore laag maar wordt geen effect gevonden. Voor waardering verschillen 
de resultaten tussen de medicijnen: Voor de bijsluiter van ciprofloxacine wordt een pictogrameffect 
gevonden op begrijpelijkheid, aantrekkelijkheid en overzichtelijkheid. Voor de bijsluiter van simvastatine 
is er slechts een effect voor aantrekkelijkheid. De pictogrameffecten zijn dus niet voor alle 
medicijnteksten te generaliseren. 
Ten slotte blijkt dat er geen pictogrameffecten optreden bij de risico-inschatting van 
waarschuwingen in de verschillende toepassingen van medicijninformatie.
Ik kan concluderen dat pictogrammen de waardering van medicijninformatie verhogen. Het 
begrip en de risico-inschatting worden niet tot nauwelijks beïnvloed door het toevoegen van 
pictogrammen. Lezers vinden medicijninformatie met pictogrammen voornamelijk aantrekkelijker dan 
een tekst zonder pictogrammen. Daarnaast treedt het pictogrameffect in de bijsluitersamenvatting en 
de bijsluiter van ciprofloxacine voor alle drie de constructen op. Pictogrammen hebben dus een positief 
effect op waardering van de medicijnteksten in verschillende toepassingen. De effecten op begrip en 
risico-inschatting blijven uit."

help of an in vitro exhaustion system","['Dogariu, Yvonne']","['Borghans, Jose']",2022-02-24T00:00:32Z,EN,[],Infection and Immunity,"T cell exhaustion is a state of immune dysfunction that is integral to the failure of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to 
control HIV-1 infection. Opposingly, highly functional HIV-specific CTLs are indicative of a good disease prognosis and often lifelong HIV-1 control. In this context, we hypothesize that directly tackling T cell exhaustion could constitute the missing link in the current landscape of HIV-1 cure strategies. Here, we aim to test a wide array of current and novel therapies aimed at reversing or preventing T cell exhaustion – such as checkpoint blockade, exogenous co-stimulation, transcription and epigenetic modulators, and CD4+ T cell help. While some of these therapeutic approaches are well established in other fields (e.g. cancer immunotherapy), little similar progress is achieved in the HIV-1 cure field. As an experimental basis, we will design, optimize, and validate an in vitro exhaustion system that can reliably generate bona fide exhausted HIV-specific CTLs, which will serve as testing platform for the abovementioned treatment strategies. Overall, this project has the potential to identify the best therapeutic approach(es) of tackling T cell exhaustion, which due to the high translational potential of the in vitro exhaustion system, will undoubtedly play an important role in future combinatorial HIV-1 cure strategies. Within the HIV-1 pandemic context, while other options aiming to replace the dysfunctional HIV-specific T cell response are being explored, improving the function of the exhausted T cells is the only research avenue that could lead to an effective, equitable, functional cure that would benefit the key populations most burdened by the HIV-1 pandemic."

This study consists of 7 neuropsychological tests: Line Bisection Task, Corsi Block Tapping Task, Star Cancellation, Digit Span, Simon Task, Greyscales Task, and Tower of London.
The comparable test performance with or without a present researcher indicates that healthy participants don’t profit by a test leader in online neuropsychological assessment. In the current study, the test-retest reliability of the used tests was moderate and must be improved. In general, online assessment like the one that is carried out in the current study, is in an early stage of development.

Examining the Mediating Effect of Self-Esteem in the Relation Between Emotion Crafting and Depressive Symptoms,"['Mijić, Tena']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-02-24T00:00:29Z,EN,['emotion crafting; emotion regulation; self-esteem; contingent self-esteem; depressive symptoms'],Clinical Psychology,"Relatively few studies within the emotion regulation literature have focused on the proactive aspect of emotion regulation and its role in psychopathology. Furthermore, little is known about the underlying mechanisms in this relation. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the relation between emotion crafting (characterised by proactive behaviour aimed at generating positive emotions) and depressive symptoms, with global and contingent self-esteem as potential mediators. In total, 119 university students (M = 22.36, SD = 1.58, range 18 - 25; 82.35% female) completed online questionnaires concerning the study variables. Results indicated that emotion crafting and global self-esteem were significant predictors of depressive symptoms, while contingent self-esteem was not. Furthermore, higher emotion crafting was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms via higher levels of global self-esteem. These results add to the literature on the regulation of positive emotions, indicating that generating positive emotions may be one of the key processes in protecting individuals from ill-being, by enhancing their self-esteem."
Republic of Characters: a Social Network Centred on the Hong Kong Type,"['Xie, Yun']","['Weststeijn, Thijs']",2022-02-08T01:00:39Z,EN,[],Art History,"In 2019, a set of nineteenth-century Chinese metal matrices was discovered in the warehouse of the Museum of Ethnology (Museum Volkenkunde) in Leiden, the Netherlands. The Chinese typefaces embedded in the matrices were designed in Hong Kong, hence the name Hong Kong Type. The typefaces cast by these matrices were used to print various publications, with profound influence on the development of Sinology and Japanese studies in the Netherlands. However, they have received disproportionately little attention in their own right: their provenance has yet to be verified, and few past studies and reference books address the Hong Kong Type, let alone its significance in the past or present.
This thesis examines the birth and development of Hong Kong typefaces, the reason why they were brought to The Netherlands, their typographical application in Dutch publishing, and its global network. Taking the Hong Kong typefaces and their archives in the Dutch collection as a point of departure, this thesis address an understudied research perspective in the history of the nineteenth-century Chinese metallic typefaces: the epistemological network that joined type designers worldwide. This thesis argues that during the production of Hong Kong types, typefounders around the globe shared their views on Chinese type design through intellectual exchanges such as correspondence, visits, and publications, which have significantly influenced, directly or indirectly, the design and application of Hong Kong Type. I call this social network “the Republic of Characters”. Over time, the involvement of non-European participants made this social network increasingly diverse."

Het onderzoeksdoel was: bijdragen aan het realiseren van meer aandacht voor vrouwen- en wereldgeschiedenis in het Nederlandse voorgezet geschiedenisonderwijs. Een uitgebreide voorbereidende oriëntatie heeft drie conclusies opgeleverd: (1) Vrouwen- en wereldgeschiedenis spelen een kleine rol in het geschreven en uitgevoerde curriculum. Ruimte voor deze geschiedenis wordt door docenten vaak niet herkend of door een gebrek aan tijd en lesmateriaal niet benut. (2) Aandacht voor vrouwen- en wereldgeschiedenis zorgt voor een diverser curriculum met meer representativiteit, ruimte voor multiperspectiviteit en aandacht voor tegenstellingen en ongelijkheid. Hierdoor kunnen docenten meerdere onderwijsdoelen nastreven met betrekking tot de beginsituatie van leerlingen en de doeldomeinen kwalificatie, socialisatie en subjectificatie. (3) Curriculumherziening, methodeherziening en het aanpassen van de curriculumuitvoering door docenten kunnen meer aandacht voor vrouwen- en wereldgeschiedenis realiseren. Op basis van deze bevindingen is besloten om een handreiking voor geschiedenisdocenten te ontwerpen voor het aanpassen van hun curriculumuitvoering.

De onderzoeksvraag luidde: aan welke criteria moet een handreiking voor geschiedenisdocenten voldoen om meer aandacht voor vrouwen- en wereldgeschiedenis mogelijk te maken? Deze vraag is beantwoord middels een evaluatie van de handreiking door twee focusgroepen van docenten en docenten-in-opleiding. Voor de docentenevaluatie is een vragenlijst gebruikt. De docenten-in-opleiding hebben hun evaluatie mondeling volbracht en overgedragen. Dit onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat docenten het aanpassen van hun curriculumuitvoering met een handreiking als een vruchtbare methode zien voor het realiseren van meer aandacht voor vrouwen- en wereldgeschiedenis. Een handreiking kan de ruimte voor vrouwen- en wereldgeschiedenis duidelijk maken, docenten in staat stellen deze te benutten en praktisch lesmateriaal leveren. Daarnaast zijn er tien ontwerpcriteria en een bruikbare docentenhandreiking voor het realiseren van meer aandacht voor vrouwen- en wereldgeschiedenis in het Nederlandse voorgezet geschiedenisonderwijs geproduceerd. De conclusies zijn voornamelijk relevant voor de specifieke onderzoekscontext, maar kunnen case-by-case gegeneraliseerd worden voor ander onderzoek."

Following Sylvia Wynter’s call for the invention of new kinds or “genres” of the human, this thesis will define the global decolonial revolution as the becoming-other of the world in its entirety. I will therefore begin with a discussion of Wynter’s conception of the human as always being a genre, followed by an in-depth demonstration of our current genre of the human and its abject core, whereby the necessity for a new genre(s) of the human will become indisputable regarding the search of a world beyond inequality.
Following Wynter’s theory of the human as essentially inessential besides the potentiality to become a genre(s) of the human, Chapter Two will, firstly, delineate Deleuze’s preferred form of learning and teaching, and secondly, show how this conception of pedagogy meets all of Wynter’s requirements for the invention of a new genre(s) of the human, by which learning corresponds with the invention of a new genre(s) of the human following critical unlearning movements on the part of the learner.
This thesis’ last portion will discuss Taka Taka’s drag experimentation-in-action pedagogy. First establishing a conception of drag that speaks in an manner equal to Wynter and Deleuze’s decolonial revolutionary terms, this thesis will argue that Taka Taka’s drag practice correlates with a Deleuzian conception of learning whereby a novel genre of the human as “becoming-imperceptible” (Deleuze and Guattari 2013) is invented. This will be followed by an in-depth investigation in Taka Taka’s teaching practice, in which they do not illustrate the new genre of the human in their teaching but instead facilitate structures whereby the learner comes to be drawn into a mode of perpetual invention, far removed from the hegemonic abject defined genre of the human."

Kinematic Inversion of Large Relative Motion Datasets Derived from Combined Geodetic Velocity Fields: an Application to the Mediterranean Region,"['Gesbert, Boris']","['Spakman, Wim']",2022-02-11T00:00:56Z,EN,['pure kinematic inversion; mediterranean plate boundary zone; crustal deformation; gps observations; relative motion data; velocity gradient field; surface fault slip; network euler rotations'],Earth Structure and Dynamics,"Previous applications of the Spakman-Nyst method to inverse problems of slow regional crustal deformation have been technically restricted to tens or hundreds of geodetic velocities within a single observation network. Here, we test the relative motion inversion technique on thousands of GPS observations compiled from tens of different studies. Our case study is the Alpine-Mediterranean plate boundary zone, for which 8969 station vectors from 45 papers are merged into one lateral velocity field. To avoid pairing all GPS data through ~40 million integration paths, we utilize a new dartboard site connection algorithm that allows for decreasing the number of relative motion observations to a few million without impairing model quality. The model parametrization coupling the corresponding integral equations comprises a possible maximum of 4*691 and 2*98 unknown velocity gradient tensor and surface fault slip components, respectively, at 584 model nodes spanning 1111 spherical triangles. Large triangles characterize data-deficient areas where we constrain the inverse problem with synthetic data and strain rate damping. Subsequently, 43 GPS datasets are corrected for network Euler rotations (i.e. 3*43 unknowns) relative to a chosen reference network. This enables us to average co-located observations into single vectors, which reduces the computation time of the forward problem, and to estimate rigid Euler velocities from four datasets enclosed by plate boundary faults that outline the Adriatic, Aegean, Anatolian, and Calabrian sub-regions in the model. Finally, we present a new approach to investigating intraplate deformation by comparing inversion of the geodetic observations with inverting the Euler motions at all data sites from the four sub-regions and major African, Arabian, and Eurasian plates. We find that inversion for the velocity gradient field and inactive or active fault creep results in the largest kinematic differences between the GPS and Euler motion inversions, reflecting internal deformation. The two inversion types show a significant fault-local data misfit especially in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, being related to trade-offs between almost perfectly resolved velocity gradient and fault slip parameters where observations near faults are lacking. Our main conclusion is that the Spakman-Nyst method and its implementation can be efficiently applied to thousands of geodetic data points. We suggest to explore the trade-off complication before making further model interpretations."
"The Role of Patient-Reported Outcomes in

Labelling (2018-2020)","['Al-Mugoter, Nora']","['Boer, A. de']",2022-02-11T00:01:00Z,EN,[],Farmacie,"BACKGROUND
Little is known about the role Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) play in, the main clinical studies, the 
benefit-risk assessment, product labelling, and which determinants play a role herein. 
METHOD
We evaluated the European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) of new medicinal agents with a 
regulatory decision (approved or refused) by the EMA between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 
2020. The primary and secondary endpoints of the main studies, benefit-risk balance, effect tables 
(results that have a strong influence on the assessment) and SmPC (for patient care decision-making) 
were evaluated for any mention of PROs. 
RESULTS
A total of 149 products met our criteria. Of these, 84 (56.40%) mentioned PROs. PROs were used 
significantly more as a secondary endpoint and contributed significantly more to patient care decision-making by chronic treatment compared to acute and preventive treatment. Furthermore, the disease 
category played a significant role in PRO use. For example, by respiratory conditions, PROs weighed in 
on 100% of the effect tables and SmPC. In contrast to infectious disease, where PROs weighed in on 
5%, and 0% of their effect tables and SmPC, respectively. Moreover, PROs from blinded studies 
contributed significantly more to patient care decision-making compared to open-label studies 3.836 
(95% Cl 1.802-8.167, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, different product determinants play a role in the utilization and contribution of PROs to 
the assessment and patient care decision-making. Overall, more PRO claims are being approved by the 
EMA and a gradual increase are seen in their contribution to support drug licensing. They are weighing 
in more and more on the benefit-risk balance assessment."

Uit de analyse blijkt dat het grootste verschil tussen de lesbische romans uit de jaren zeventig en het heden zit in de narratieve ontwikkelingen in de romans. Hierbij valt met name het verschil in de invullingen van de lesbische identiteit op. In de romans uit de jaren zeventig komt het idee dat het lesbisch zijn een politieke keuze is duidelijk naar voren. In de hedendaagse romans komt een visie op seksualiteit naar voren die meer fluïde is. Personages hebben moeite met de vaste hokjes en verwachtingen van de maatschappij, en bevragen actief hun eigen seksualiteit en gender."
Success and failure factors for grass-fibre innovations,"['Sonnenschein, Jannah']","['Verkade, Nick']",2022-02-01T00:00:29Z,EN,[],Sustainable Business and Innovation,"Introduction
Despite several successful pilots, no technological invention, regarding high value application of grass-fibres, has made it to a successful scale-up. For the biowaste sector, it is useful to have insights that can guide them to either invest in ideas that have more potential to become successful or design the innovation process in such a way that the innovation will have a better chance to become successful. Therefore, the following research question was adopted:

What are the drivers and barriers for innovations in extraction and application of roadside grass-fibre, and can patterns be detected?

Theory
Inductive research was used to answer the research question. The Technological Innovation System (TIS) was used as a framework to categorize and analyse processes that hamper or support the scale up.

Methodology
This research used a multi-case study approach and analysed five cases. Using qualitative data, a total of 24 function indicators were developed and assessed. Overall, 18 interviews were conducted among 13 interviewees. Four interviews focused on determining the case studies, seven were held with other relevant actors for general information on grass-fibre innovations, and seven were conducted on the different case studies.

Prior to the case study interviews, interviewees filled out a survey, scoring indicators on a nominal scale. The survey brought insights on relevant indicators and served to design the semi-structured interviews.

Results
For six out of seven TIS functions there was ""Room for Improvement”. The only function that was not considered a barrier is (Technical) Knowledge Development.

Conclusion
The technical development of innovative products is often not the problem, market penetration is. This research found three prominent barriers that need to be addressed first:

- Late market engagement: Current grass-fibre innovations are substitute innovations but only engage the market late in the innovation process. Consequently, valuable input and buy-in from the market lack in the innovation process making it difficult to build a business case for continued investment.

- Non-competitiveness of the grass-fibre: The competitiveness of grass-fibre is not significant and varies per end-product, making it a difficult sell to the markets.

- Difficulty in implementing Organizational change: The requested organizational change from public entities like roadside managers, to also become a resource supplier to the private market is challenging.



The most important drivers include:

- Motivation & perseverance of value-chain partners;

- Smart Management of existing laws and regulations.


This research also calls for refining the TIS theory on two aspects:

- The TIS theory should add the Organizational Capacity to Change as an 8th function to the innovation ecosystem.

- The TIS should distinguish between radical innovation and substitute innovation when it describes the importance of the functions in the different development stages."

is in deze scriptie onderzoek gedaan naar de fantasyfondsen van vier Nederlandse
uitgeverijen. Dit is gebeurd aan de hand van de volgende hoofdvraag: ‘Hoe zag het profiel
van de fantasyfondsen van Luitingh-Sijthoff, Van Goor, Moon en Blossom Books er tussen
2010 en 2020 uit?'

Dit onderzoek was kwantitatief van aard en is uitgevoerd aan de hand van
fondslijsten van de publicaties van de uitgeverijen in de geanalyseerde periode. In deze
lijsten zijn zowel objectieve (auteur, titel, jaar van uitgave, etc.) als subjectieve (subgenre,
soort serie en doelgroep) gegevens over de bron- en doelteksten opgenomen.

Uit de resultaten bleek dat Luitingh-Sijthoff een zeer breed fonds had dat vooral
bestond uit scripted high fantasy voor volwassenen. Van Goor en Moon hadden allebei een
middelgroot fonds dat vooral bestond uit scripted fantasy voor jongvolwassenen, waarbij de
belangrijkste subgenres voor Van Goor high fantasy, urban fantasy, sciencefiction en
dystopie waren en voor Moon high fantasy, low fantasy, urban fantasy en paranormale
romantische fantasy. Blossom Books had het kleinste fonds en gaf vooral scripted high
fantasy, sciencefiction en dystopie uit, nagenoeg alleen maar voor jongvolwassenen.

Luitingh-Sijthoff onderscheidde zich vooral door het specifieke profiel van scripted
high fantasy voor volwassenen, Van Goor en Moon onderscheidden zich vooral door de
relatief grote rol van Nederlandse auteurs in het fonds in vergelijking met de twee andere
uitgeverijen, en Blossom Books onderscheidde zich vooral door de hoge mate van
gerichtheid op jongvolwassenen. Bij alle uitgeverijen speelden vertalingen en dan vooral uit
het Engels een grote rol.

In de toekomst kan de in deze scriptie vergaarde kennis uitgebreid worden door
onderzoek te doen naar andere Nederlandse uitgeverijen van fantasy, andere periodes of

Curating the Indigenous at the Venice Biennale: Reading Viva Arte Viva through Posthuman Theory and Indigenous Critique,"['Šlėgerytė, Akvilė']","['Dolphijn, R.']",2022-02-01T00:00:55Z,EN,[],Arts and Society,"In the times of the global climate crisis, there seems to be a turn towards the Indigenous in the academia and contemporary art world. It can be linked to the theoretical movements that attempt to reposition Western power-knowledge. Postcolonialism had been addressing the lack of representation of people of colour in the knowledge production processes and exposing the power relations rooted within it. Consequently, it seeks to reposition Indigenous knowledge to the centre of knowledge production processes. Posthumanism, one of the major contemporary turns in Western thought, acknowledges the violence committed through humanism and advocates for the inclusion of missing people and missing knowledge in knowledge production processes. It rethinks and attempts to displace the binaries that define humanism and resulted in exclusion and marginalisation of other forms of knowledge. As a consequence, we can witness more and more contemporary art exhibitions where Indigenous knowledge, which is not defined by the binaries between nature and culture, reason and spirituality, is framed within the posthuman concepts. Viva Arte Viva, the central exhibition of the 57th Venice Biennale, can be seen as an example of such curatorial strategies. It attempts to rethink humanism through redefining its constructed binaries and looking for spaces in-between, and, thus, stages artworks about Indigeneity within this framework. However, Indigenous scholars argue that the lack of representation of Indigenous peoples in the discussions about Indigeneity results in the misinterpretation and misrepresentation of Indigenous cosmologies and, thus, the exploitation of Indigenous knowledge. The analysis of individual works that talk about Indigeneity in the Viva Arte Viva exhibition helps us to see the blind spots of such forms of inclusion."

With a positive temperature anomaly of 150-200 ◦C at 4-5 km depth, geothermal energy generation from the Luttelgeest platform is an enterprise that could be considered. It comprises an isolated carbonate platform system, which is located in the Dutch onshore subsurface below the province of Flevoland and is encountered at 4355 to 5123 m depth. Only one well, Luttelgeest-01 (LTG-01) penetrates the succession. Previous work on the area has shown that the carbonates comprise a fine-grained, muddy matrix with an intergranular porosity close to 0% which initially would make fluid convection impossible. The margins, however, are heavily fractured and might provide pathways for fluid flow. In this study, the geothermal potential of the platform has been evaluated by the analysis of core, log, well data of LTG- 01, together with 2D seismic data and analogues. Firstly, the goal is to design a workflow and apply it to reach a set objective on these Dinantian carbonates, with the idea that the same workflow could be applied to similar cases elsewhere. Secondly, a conceptual model for fluid flow in the platform through a fault plane is proposed, as well as stratigraphic boundaries between sequence cycles in the platform. This model reveals the considerable possibilities of the Luttelgeest platform for ultra deep geothermal development."

Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Applications in High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment for Uterine Fibroids,"['Madzia-Madzou, Djennifer']","['Bartels, Wilbert']",2022-02-01T00:00:40Z,EN,"['Uterine fibroids, DCE-MRI, HIFU']",Medical Imaging,"Uterine fibroids are abnormal growths in the uterus. These growths are often harmless compared to tumors. 70% of women get uterine fibroids in their lives before the age of 50. Of these women, about 15-30% develop symptoms that decrease their quality of life. Currently, this can be treated with surgery, medicine, or non-invasive methods. Not all treatments are suitable for everyone. The choice depends on multiple factors, for instance, the wish to be able to bear children. If that is the case, surgery is often not the right choice since the uterus is (partly) removed. Medicinal treatments often suppress the symptoms but do not treat the fibroids. Non-invasive methods are often still very new and in the experimental phase however, they do show a lot of potential. One example of a non-invasive method is using High Intensity Ultrasound (HIFU). HIFU focuses ultrasound waves to a focal point where it creates heat due to friction, similar to how a magnifying glass can heat up paper. In this case, the focal point is located in the fibroids. The raised temperature then kills the cells of the fibroid. However the success of a HIFU treatment depends on the location, size, and characteristics of the fibroid since a certain temperature needs to be reached to damage the cells sufficiently. It is important to know which patients are suitable for HIFU treatment to maximize treatment success rates. 

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to plan the treatment beforehand and to evaluate it. During the planning stage, the image is used to check if the fibroids are suitable for HIFU treatment and where to heat the tissue. During evaluation, a contrast agent is used to visualize the dead tissue of the fibroid by looking at the locations where the blood is still flowing to the cells.  MRI is a method that can provide additional information, which is not fully utilized at the moment. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) uses mathematical modeling to provide more information on the microvasculature of the vessels. This paper explores the added value DCE-MRI can bring on HIFU treatment of uterine fibroids.

Fibroids that are bright on so-called T2 weighted MR images are often very difficult to treat with HIFU. With DCE-MRI these fibroids can be further subcategorized in a treatable fibroid and an untreatable one. It is found that fibroids with a high blood flow, cannot be heated properly because the heat dissipates from the focal point. These are untreatable. The treatable fibroids have a high blood volume, which does not affect HIFU’s ability to heat up the tissue as much. This is the most important finding of this paper. Others include suggestions that are tried on a small number of cases. This is not enough to draw conclusions about the method, however, those ideas can be used as inspiration for further research."
Using simulations to stimulate higher-order thinking in the solving complex problems,"['Kroon, Marga van der']","['Joolingen, Wouter van']",2022-02-01T00:00:52Z,EN,['Critical thinking; Problem Based Learning; problem-posing education; simulation.'],Science Education and Communication,"This study investigates how simulation in the classroom can be used to stimulate and improve critical thinking, also known as higher-order thinking. It uses simulation and is based on a mixed strategy of problem-based learning and problem-posing education. To ensure that the simulation could be used as efficiently and effectively as possible, additional use was made of self-developed instructions and questions via video and worksheets. The research was conducted at a pre-university school among students, both singles and duos
from the first year. Because both the approach of singles and duos was examined, the difference between them could also be studied. The results are categorized using Blooms' taxonomy. This study demonstrates that with the chosen approach the students are challenged to the use of higher-order thinking. In addition, the students without exception found this a stimulating way of working and learning."

The World’s Ending and We’re Still Making Theatre: New-Hope Dramaturgy in Contemporary Queer Performance,"['Jolliffe, Madie']","['Wan, Evelyn']",2022-03-01T00:00:35Z,EN,"['New-Hope, Dramaturgy, Contemporary Performance, Queer Performance, Dance, Theatre, Creation, Utopia, Cruel Optimism, Queer Futurity, Tender Men, Pilot PC']","Contemporary Theatre, Dance and Dramaturgy","This thesis works to establish dramaturgical procedures of new-hope, based in queer, feminist, and performance theory, to be used in the creation of performance. This thesis looks to Edelman, Muñoz, Campt, and Berlant’s arguments of the pitfalls of the present and notions of futurity to establish the pillars of new-hope. I looked to these fields of knowledge as well as performance theory (Dolan, Campbell and Farrier) to establish dramaturgical procedures of new-hope. New-hope is a concept I have developed because the hope that has kept us complicit in oppressive systems has expired and we now need a new-hope to activate us in creating a present that is good to us all and not just a privileged few. Considering the crises that plague our daily lives, (such as the climate, immigration and covid-19 crises,) in order to move towards a better future, we need a new kind of hope and a place to practice it. New-hope can be found in many areas of society but these areas are restricted by reality and practicalities. Art is the realm in which new-hope can best be explored because it is not concerned directly with improving the world. More specifically, performance, thanks to its characteristics of community, embodied and affective communication, experimentation, risk, and failure is, I argue, the most fitting place to explore new-hope. The procedures I propose are four action-based gestures that can be to used to create performance and which also establishes a framework to analyze performance. To test out the dramaturgical framework, I interviewed the makers of two contemporary queer performances, Koen De Preter and Connor Schumacher. I investigated the decisions that were made in the creation and rehearsal processes of their pieces Tender Men and Pilot PC and used the dramaturgical framework as an analysis tool to see how those decisions manifested in the performances. Based on this, I propose that a dramaturgy of new-hope can be used as a guide to activate imagination and play in order to allow for utopian speculation, experimentation, and simulation, thus fostering and facilitating a hope that can apply to our present."
More-Than-Human Practices: Feminist Ecological Potentials of Working With More-Than-Humans in the Performing Arts,"['Žeželj, Tery']","['Georgelou, Konstantina']",2022-02-28T00:00:28Z,EN,[],"Contemporary Theatre, Dance and Dramaturgy","This thesis examines artistic practices developed through co-working with more-than-humans and maps the wider feminist ecological potentials of practicing such multispecies environments in the performing arts. The theoretical framework takes feminist discourse on water from Mielle Chandler and Astrida Neimanis's article ""Water and Gestationality: What Flows beneath Ethics"" as a departure point to conceptualize more-than-human collaborations in the performing arts and to generate grounds for articulating ethics that enable responsivity to the entanglements with 'natural others'. This framework is intertwined with the discourse on dramaturgy to reapproach the practice of dramaturgy through collaborations and articulate it as a shared practice and collective thinking that emerges from the relations between diverse bodies. In the thesis, I map the main aspects of 'more-than-human practices' and 'interspecies practices' in the performing arts. Characteristics and challenges posed by co-working with more-than-humans are further unfolded by drawing on the two longer artistic practices and researches, Rooted Hauntology Lab by Ingrid Vranken, potted plants, and ghosts, and Cosmologies of Attention and Spectatorship, practice-based research by Julia Willms and Andrea Božić in collaboration with the Moon. By analyzing specific modes of relating and co-working with them, and by researching the main aspects that their collaborations bring in the front, the feminist ecological potentials that lie in cultivating responsivity to more-than-human co-workers, are defined."
Geodesics in the Carroll limit,"['Denzen, Arjan van']","['Vandoren, S.J.G.']",2022-03-01T00:00:33Z,EN,['Carroll limit; geodesics'],Theoretical Physics,"The focus of this thesis is the Carroll limit, the limit of vanishing speed of light. This can be thought of as the opposite of the Galilean (or Newtonian) limit, in which we take the limit of infinite speed of light. We look at taking this limit in the context of finding geodesics in general relativity, because there is not a lot of literature about this subject yet. Given a spacetime, we can take the Carroll limit in different stages of the process of finding geodesics, and it turns out that this will give us different, but similar, results for the existence of certain geodesics. All will be illustrated with examples in Minkowski, Schwarzschild, and de Sitter spacetime. The main result of this thesis is the Carroll limit of the geodesic equations being written down. We also found a non-trivial Carroll geodesic in the Schwarzschild spacetime, which shows that there can be moving particles in the Carroll limit in a non-flat spacetime."
On how transformers learn to understand and evaluate nested arithmetic expressions,"['Grashoff, Daan']","['Paperno, Denis']",2022-03-01T00:00:29Z,EN,['Transformer; interpretability of neural networks;compositionality;embedding depth'],Artificial Intelligence,"In this thesis, we studied whether self-attention networks can learn compositional seman- tics using an arithmetic language. The goal of language aims to evaluate the meaning of nested expressions. We find that self-attention networks can learn to evaluate these nested expres- sions by taking shortcuts on less complex expressions or utilizing deeper layers on complex expressions when the nested depth grows. The complexity is in whether expressions are left- (easy) or right-branching (hard) and whether, in the case of right-branching expressions, plus (easy) or minus (complex) operators are used. We find that increasing the number of heads does not always help with more complex expressions, whereas the number of layers does always help to generalize to deeper expressions. Finally, to help with the understanding of what the self-attention networks are doing, we analyzed the attention scores and found exciting patterns such as the numbers attending to the preceding operators and nested sub-expressions attend- ing to preceding operators. These patterns may explain why in less complex expressions, the self-attention networks take shortcuts, but in more complex expressions, this is not possible by the way the self-attention networks try to solve them."
"De keerzijde van innovatie, over de effectiviteit van de handhavingsmogelijkheden van deepnudes onder de Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming","['Winder, Koen de']","['Mohammed, R.']",2022-03-01T00:00:30Z,NL,['AVG;Deepfakes;Deepnudes;Privacy;persoonsgegevens;kunstmatige intelligentie;technologie;internet;rechtsbescherming;handhaving;autoriteit persoonsgegevens;effectiviteit'],"Intellectueel eigendomsrecht, innovatie en technologie","Een van de nieuwste ontwikkelingen op digitaal vlak is de deepfake technologie. Deepfakes zijn nepvideo's die worden geproduceerd om echt te lijken. Tegenwoordig zijn deepfakevideo’s zo realistisch, dat met het blote oog niet of nauwelijks meer te zien is dat het om nepvideo's gaat. Enkele bekende deepfaketoepassingen zijn faceswap, lip sync en spraaksynthese.  Onderzoek wijst uit dat bijna 96% van de deepfakevideo’s die op internet circuleren pornovideo’s betreffen. Deze pornovideo’s worden ook wel deepnudes genoemd.
De techniek wordt steeds beter en toegankelijker. Toch bestaat er nog geen wetgeving die specifiek gericht is op het handhaven van deepfakes. Hierdoor weten betrokkenen niet of zij succesvol kunnen optreden tegen deepnudes. Ook is er nog geen jurisprudentie beschikbaar. Het doel van het onderzoek is om te achterhalen of betrokkenen effectief kunnen optreden tegen een publicatie van een deepnude. Hiervoor wordt aansluiting gezocht bij de Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming.
De volgende hoofdvraag is geformuleerd: Kunnen deepnudes effectief worden gehandhaafd onder de Algemene Verordening Gegevensbescherming, gelet op de belangen van slachtoffers. Hierbij worden alle handhavingsmogelijkheden die de betrokkene ter beschikking heeft op grond van de AVG gebruikt, mits relevant. Daarnaast worden de gevolgen van de betrokkene onderzocht. De impact van een publicatie van een deepnude is erg subjectief en van veel factoren afhankelijk. De gevolgen kunnen daarom per persoon flink uiteenlopen. Aangezien deepnudes erg nieuw zijn en de gevolgen voor betrokkenen nog niet bekend zijn, zal een brug gemaakt moeten worden met vergelijkbare situaties waarvan de gevolgen reeds inzichtelijk zijn. Hiervoor wordt een studie gebruikt, waar onderzoek is verricht naar de gevolgen van seksueel misbruik op basis van afbeeldingen. In dit onderzoek zijn 75 slachtoffers geïnterviewd. Tijdens deze interviews komt naar voren wat de openbaring van een seksueel getinte foto of video, met inbegrip van digitale bewerkingen, voor impact had op hun dagelijks leven.
Handhaving is effectief wanneer ieder nadelig gevolg voor de betrokkene kan worden voorkomen. Omdat sommige gevolgen kunnen intreden vanaf het moment van publicatie, zal het onmogelijk zijn om ieder gevolg volledig te voorkomen (daarvoor zou de publicatie met terugwerkende kracht ongedaan gemaakt moeten worden). Om die reden wordt mede overwogen of de schadelijke gevolgen stopgezet kunnen worden en of de betrokkene hiervoor kan worden gecompenseerd. Een enkele compensatie zal niet worden beschouwd als effectieve handhaving.  

Na een afweging tussen de handhaving en de gevolgen komt naar voren dat snelheid de belangrijkste factor is voor de verkrijging van effectiviteit. De beschikbare rechtsmiddelen worden effectiever naarmate de inbreuk korter voortduurt en er sneller wordt opgetreden. Er heeft vervolgens een afweging plaatsgevonden, waaruit is gebleken dat de snelheid van optreden en het verkorten van de inbreuk niet zal worden bevorderd door de handhavingsmogelijkheden te verbeteren (bijvoorbeeld door een wetswijziging). Ook zal een wijziging van de beschikbare rechten van de betrokkene geen soelaas bieden. Het probleem is dat er onvoldoende detectiemiddelen zijn om de grote hoeveelheid deepnudes die dagelijks op het internet worden gepubliceerd op te sporen. Doordat de deepnudes niet tijdig kunnen worden opgespoord, wordt het haast onmogelijk gemaakt om snel op te treden. Het is immers niet mogelijk op te treden tegen een deepnude waarvan je niet weet dat die bestaat. Bovendien zijn er momenteel meer onderzoekers bezig met de verbetering van de kwaliteit van de deepfake-content, dan het ontwikkelen van detectiemiddelen. Naar verwachting zal het detectieprobleem alleen maar groter worden. Zonder innovatie op het gebied van detectie, kunnen deepnudes niet effectief gehandhaafd worden"
De KNLTB en haar legitimiteit in transitie?,"['Veldhuis, Hans']","['Slobbe, Michel van']",2022-02-26T00:00:28Z,NL,['Legitimiteit ; Transitie ; Tennis ; Institutionele theorie ; Sportbond'],Sports Policy and Sports Management,"De KNLTB heeft de afgelopen decennia te maken gehad met een forse ledendaling (KNLTB, 2020). Deze ledenafname heeft ervoor gezorgd dat het financieringsmodel van de tennissportorganisaties onder druk is komen te staan. Om het structureel dalende ledenaantal een halt toe te roepen, heeft de KNLTB een taakverbredende transitie ondergaan. De tennisbond, die voornamelijk bezig was met het ondersteunen van verenigingen, is omgeturnd tot een tennis – en padelbond die naast de verenigingen ook de ongebonden sporters en commerciële centra (beter) wil faciliteren en ondersteunen. De taakverbreding kan gevolgen hebben voor de institutionele legitimiteitspositie van de KNLTB. Om dit in kaart te brengen is de volgende onderzoeksvraag opgesteld: ‘Welke betekenissen geven de bestuurders van de tennisverenigingen en bondsfunctionarissen aan de verbrede taakopvatting van de tennisbond en wat leert ons dat over verandering van institutionele legitimiteit?’
Om een beter begrip te krijgen van de institutionele omgeving binnen de Nederlandse tenniswereld neemt de institutionele theorie van Furusten (2013) een prominente plaats in. Om als organisatie het bestaansrecht te waarborgen binnen het institutionele veld, gaan organisaties op zoek naar legitimiteit. De institutionele theorie wordt daarom aangevuld met bestaande theorie rondom de legitimiteit van organisaties, waarbij een prominente rol is weggelegd voor de theorie van Deephouse et al. (2017) omtrent het toekennen en het veranderen van legitimiteit over een bepaalde tijd. Om de hoofdvraag te beantwoorden is er gebruik gemaakt van een literatuurstudie, documentanalyse en semi-gestructureerde interviews met tien verenigingsbestuurders en vier bondsfunctionarissen. 
Zowel de KNLTB als de verenigingen worden institutioneel onder druk gezet door haar institutionele omgeving. Hierbij komt de grootste institutionele druk vanuit  ‘societal trends’ als individualisering, consumentisme en flexibilisering en de ‘institutional actors’. Zowel de KNLTB als de sportverenigingen hebben ervoor gekozen om, ingegeven door bovenstaande institutionele druk, op te schuiven van de verenigingslogica naar een (gedeeltelijke) consumentenlogica. De KNLTB probeert middels de verenigingslogica nog altijd de verenigingen te ondersteunen, maar stuurt wel aan op een meer consumentgerichte aanpak binnen de verenigingen, die de KNLTB zelf faciliteert middels de tennis – en padelboeker. De verenigingslogica binnen de vereniging komt nog altijd terug in de organisatie van de vereniging, maar verenigingen zijn steeds vaker bezig met het commercialiseren en het professionaliseren van de vereniging. 
Met het ondersteunen van commerciële centra en het faciliteren van tennis en padel voor ongebonden sporters is de legitimiteitspositie van de KNLTB verstevigd. De belangrijkste institutionele actor van de KNLTB, de tennisverenigingen, profiteert echter maar deels van de taakverbreding. Aan de ene kant zijn de verenigingen blij met nieuwe producten als de tennis – en padelboeker, waarmee ze ongebonden tennissers kunnen bereiken. Aan de andere kant leidt de taakverbreding tot onbegrip bij verenigingsbestuurders, die stellen dat ongebonden tennissers en commerciële centra een voorkeursbehandeling krijgen van de KNLTB. 
De taakverbreding van een organisatie wordt als succesvol bestempeld als ook de bestaande, dominante institutionele actoren hier voordeel van hebben. Als de dominante institutionele actor het gevoel heeft ondermijnd te worden door de taakverbreding leidt dat tot een gevaar voor de legitimiteitspositie. Het verruimen van de taakopvatting is daarmee een kwestie van het zoeken naar een balans tussen vernieuwing en voldoen aan de behoeftes van de belangrijkste institutionele actor."
"Ant-fungal interactions, both friend and foe","['Krijgsman, Gabriëlle']","['Wosten, Han']",2022-03-01T00:00:31Z,EN,"['fungi, insect, interactions, ant, symbiose, pathogen, biocontrol agent, medicine']",Environmental Biology,"A wide variety of aspects in human life are affected by fungi. Fungi themselves are commercially grown for the consumption of mushrooms, and produce various proteins, antibiotics and other small molecules in the industry. They are also organisms that play a major role in the biodegradation of dead plant material and ensure the recycling of nutrients. In addition, fungi frequently form mutualistic, parasitic and commensal interactions with insects, including the ant, these interactions are important but not yet fully understood.
	The Ophiocordyceps is a parasitic fungi that infects a broad range of insects, however this interaction is best known for infection in ants. By infecting the ant, the fungi incorporates itself within the host. With chemical infiltrations to the brain the fungi alters the expression of certain genes, which has an effect on the levels of adenosine and ergothioneine present in the host. Such adaptations lead to behavioral changes different from their natural ones. For instance the ant is forced to leave its nest beneath the ground and climbs into the forest canopy, when positioned underneath a leave the ant performs a death grip and dies. From this point the fungi takes over its host completely, by consuming the ant an inside out consumption. The fungi acquires the needed energy to produce its fruiting body that grows out of the ant, what results in the production of spores which can infect new hosts within the environment. This infectious lifestyle can be dated back to 23-66 million years ago, to maintain these interactions over a longer period of time evolution of new defense and attack strategies are needed.
	The Lepiotaceae fungi forms a mutualistic interaction with an ant, in particular leaf-cutter ants. The ants harvest fresh plant material to feed the fungi and in return it forms primordia, fungal structures of which ants can feed. This interaction has become obligatory and special chambers are developed within the ant’s nest. To protect the fungal garden a few extra measurements have evolved over time. The social immunity of an ants nest will include the fungal gardens. Extra mutualistic interactions between the ant and other antifungal producing microorganisms, actinobacteria, that don’t effect the Lepiotaceae cultivar have been acquired. Semiochemicals ensure communication between fungi and ant, to minimize damage from plant materials that inhabits pathogens or includes toxins that are harmful to the fungal colony. 
	The leaf cutter ant can be seen as a pest when large parts of crops disappear from herbivory. To protect crops against attacks like these and other instances a parasitic pathogen like the Ophiocordyceps fungus can be used as a biocontrol agent. This method is more environment friendly than with the use of chemical compounds, the instances of resistance against biocontrol agents has a higher change of remaining low and it has a more specific pathogen target. The Ophiocordyceps might even be used in future medicine due to the improvement of human health."

The goal of this study is to develop further knowledge on the early onset of sexual activity in adolescence, whilst simultaneously furthering scientific knowledge on HipHop/R&B as a potential risk factor. The sample consists of 742 high school students living in the Netherlands (Age: M = 15.81; SD = 1.36, 54.4% boys). Results of binary logistic regressions showed that (1) HipHop/R&B does not significantly predict the early onset of sexual intercourse (OR = .95; p = .738), (2) there is no evidence that holding gender stereotypes plays a role in this relationship, and (3) that holding gender stereotypes is significantly associated to the early onset of sexual intercourse (OR = 2.70; p < .001). Findings suggest that liking HipHop/R&B should not be considered a risk factor when investigating adolescent sexual health, but rather gender stereotypes. Such results should only be interpreted and understood within the context of this study and its limitations."
The effect of parental stress on bullying and victimization in adolescence and the role of self-control and gender as a moderator,"['Leijerzapf, Maud']","['Peeters, Margot']",2022-01-29T00:00:50Z,EN,[],Youth Studies,"Bullying in adolescence is found to negatively affect the mental health of adolescents. Multiple studies have found a positive association between parental stress and bullying/victimization. As far as known the current study is one of the first studies exploring the predictive relationship between parental stress and bullying/victimization over time. It is expected that parental stress at age 11 predicts bullying and victimization at age 14. Also, the moderating effects of gender and self-control are assessed. The effects are expected to be stronger for boys. Higher self-control is expected to weaken the relationship. Data of the longitudinal TRAILS study was used to test the hypotheses (N=2229; 50.7% female; Mage = 11.1 years). Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that experiencing parental stress at home at age 11 predicted nomination as a bully by peers at age 14. However, parental stress did not have an effect on victimization. Furthermore, no moderating effects of self-control and gender were found. In conclusion, future research should carefully take the role of parenting into account when aiming to reduce bullying/victimization in schools."
Parental overprotection as a predictor for adolescents’ externalizing behavior problems and the moderating effect of family socioeconomic status and adolescents’ gender,"['Hooft van Huijsduijnen, Anne']","['Peeters, Margot']",2022-01-29T00:01:00Z,EN,['overprotective parenting; externalizing behavior; adolescents; helicopter parenting; socioeconomic status; gender'],Youth Studies,"Background: Parental involvement is generally related to positive child outcomes, but when this involvement is taken too far and becomes overprotective, it is associated with higher levels of adolescent behavioral problems. Adolescents who express externalizing behavior might face many negative consequences. Research on the effect overprotective parenting has on externalizing behavior problems has not been done often. Therefore, this study examined the predictive influence of overprotective parenting, hypothesizing that this parenting-style predicts an increase in externalizing behavior problems. This relation is expected to be stronger for adolescent boys and families with a high socioeconomic status. Methods: The main hypothesis is assessed by using data from the TRAILS study (N = 2230; 51% female; Mage = 11.10 years). Results: Adolescents who perceive their parents’ parenting style as more protective, reported an increase in externalizing behavior problems. Results indicated that lower SES groups reported higher levels of externalizing behavior problems, however, no interaction was found, and the relationship was reverse to what was hypothesized. Furthermore, the effect of parental overprotection on externalizing behavior does not differ between boys and girls. Conclusions: Adolescents who perceive their parents’ behavior as more protective, express more externalizing behavior problems. This provides important implications for ensuring adolescents’ healthy development."

The current research investigates if divorce and co-parenting are associated with emotional problems in adolescents and if conflict at home influences these associations. In addition, it is examined if resilience influences the possible relationship between co-parenting and emotional problems. For this research, cross-sectional data were used, and two samples were derived, and both consisted of Dutch adolescents between 12 - 17 years. Sample 1 (N=5326) consisted of divorced and non-divorced families. Sample 2 (N=806) consisted of divorced families only. Results show that having divorced parents was associated with having more emotional problems. Co-parenting was not associated with more emotional problems. Conflict at home did not influence the strength of the association between either divorce or 
co-parenting and emotional problems but was directly associated with having more emotional problems. Resilience was only associated with fewer emotional problems. Therefore, prevention strategies should focus on reducing conflict at home after divorce (either with or without co-parenting) and increase resilience among adolescents."

Results showed significantly negative associations between parental or peer support and flourishing, with emotional problems as underlying mechanism. For resilience, the associations were significantly positive. The associations between parental support and flourishing, and peer support and flourishing remained significant throughout the analyses, the former being the strongest. Results indicate the possible need for increasing resilience by improving interpersonal relationships at school to enable flourishing in adolescents."

Methods: For the present study, data from the Dutch Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) has been used. The sample used for this study consisted of 8912 adolescents. The distribution of 
respondents living in each family type is as follows: ‘intact’ (n = 6971), ‘single mom’ (n = 1017), ‘single dad’ (n = 178), ‘stepparent’ (n = 498). Logistic and linear

Results: Compared to intact-families, adolescents of single-mother-families, single-father families and stepparent families were more likely to have ever used laughing gas than adolescents from non-intact families. There is no significant difference between the different nonintact family structures. We did not found a mediation effect of family SES on the association between different family structures and laughing gas use. However, we did found a mediating effect of family support.

Potential differences in sex were examined. Data from 6874 adolescents participating in the HBSC-study were used. Results showed that peer acceptance partially mediates the association between goth music preference and internalizing problems for both boys and girls. Adolescents who liked goth music felt less accepted by peers and reported more internalizing problems. Furthermore, peer acceptance partially mediated the association between pop music preference and internalizing problems for both boys and girls. Youth who liked pop music experienced more peer acceptance and reported fewer internalizing problems. These findings help in understanding the link between both goth and pop and internalizing problems.

Nonheterosexuals were found to report significantly higher levels of all outcomes than heterosexual adolescents. Few interaction effects were found. Those that were found significant did not support the hypothesis that differences between non-heterosexuals and heterosexuals on mental health problems were bigger the lower the educational level, but did partly support the hypothesis of social support at home. This study supports the expectation that even in a tolerant society as the Netherlands, nonheterosexual adolescents still score higher on emotional problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity than their heterosexual peers. Overall this association seemed largely similar across level of education, religiosity and support at home and from friends."

The present study aims to provide a more complete elaboration of the music preference and cannabis use link by including gender and aggression as moderators. Furthermore, adolescents that prefer loud and energetic music seek out like minded peers, who may increase cannabis use. Therefore a preference for homogenous peer groups is included as a mediator in the link between music preferences and cannabis use. A subsample of 400 adolescents aged 13-18 (M = 20.19, SD = 3.60, 80% female) from the Qrius Switch-On project data set was used. Music preferences were conceptualized as five styles: Pop, Rock, Urban, Classical and Dance. Contrary to expectations, a hierarchical regression analysis revealed no main effect for preferring loud and energetic music on cannabis use. In addition, no moderating effects for gender or aggression were found, nor a mediation effect for peer group homogeneity.

Improvement of mitoses counting on whole slide images of breast cancer using artificial intelligence,"['Bergeijk, Stijn van']","['Diest, P.J. van']",2022-01-31T00:00:27Z,EN,['Breast cancer; mitotic count; bloom and richardson grade; digital whole slide imaging; artificial intelligence'],Medicine,"Introduction: Breast cancer (BC) prognosis is largely influenced by histopathological grade, assessed according to the Nottingham modification of Bloom-Richardson (BR). Mitotic count (MC) is a component of histopathological grading but is prone to subjectivity. This study investigated whether mitoses counting in BC using digital whole slide imaging (WSI) compares better to light microscopy (LM) when assisted by artificial intelligence (AI), and to which extent differences in digital MC (AI assisted or not) result in BR grade variations.
Methods: Fifty BC patients with paired core biopsies and resections were randomly selected. Component scores for BR grade were abstracted from pathology reports. MC was assessed using LM, WSI and AI. Different modalities (LM-MC, WSI-MC and AI-MC) were analyzed for correlation with scatterplots and linear regression, and for agreement in BR with Cohen’s Kappa.
Results: MC modalities strongly correlated in both biopsies and resections: LM-MC and WSI-MC (R2 0.737 and 0.773, respectively), LM-MC and AI-MC (R2 0.545 and 0.706) and WSI-MC and AI-MC (R2 0.692 and 0.760). Agreement in BR between modalities was high in both biopsies and resections: LM-MC and WSI-MC (kappa 0.93 and 0.834, respectively), LM-MC and AI-MC (kappa 0.89 and 0.825), and WSI-MC and AI-MC (kappa 0.96 and 0.732).
Conclusion: MC in WSI did not compare better to LM-MC when supported by AI. However, LM-MC and WSI-MC were already strongly correlated, so the expected gain from AI was inherently low. Agreement between different modalities for BR was high. WSI-MC appears as a viable alternative to LM-MC."
"A Barbaric Weapon? Representations of chemical weapons, and the reproduction and use of the Chemical Weapons Taboo in French and German national newspapers from 1899 to 1925.","['Braakman, Daan']","['Pieters, A.H.L.M.']",2022-02-22T00:00:46Z,EN,['Morality & Technology; Chemical Weapons; Chemical Weapons Taboo; French Newspapers; German Newspapers; The Hague Declaration; Five-Power Treaty; Geneva Protocol; Rif Wars; World War I'],History and Philosophy of Science,"Interest in the Chemical Weapons Taboo rekindled in 2013 when the international community argued in favour of military interventions against the Assad regime in response to its use of sarin gas in the Syrian Civil War. Recent academic publications on the topic proceed from the view that the Chemical Weapons Taboo is socially constructed and cannot be rationalised through essentialist or realist arguments. This view was originally established by Richard Price in 1997 who mapped out the construction of the Taboo with a strong focus on the
political perspective.

This thesis seeks to expand Price’s research by investigating the views of French and German national newspapers from the Hague Declaration of 1899 to the Geneva Protocol of 1925. In particular, this thesis focusses on how chemical weapons were represented in these newspapers and what these representations reveal about the reproduction and use of the Chemical Weapons Taboo. For that purpose, all articles containing the term “asphyxiating gases” and/or “deleterious gases” were considered in the French newspaper, Le Matin, and the German newspaper, Berliner Tageblatt.

These newspapers suggest that representations of chemical weapons changed significantly over time, ranging from disregard, to abhorrence, to acquiescence. Consequently, the reproduction and use of the Chemical Weapons Taboo were often situational and sometimes even highly inconsistent."

Een neoformalistische filmanalyse waarin vertelperspectief en mise-en-scène met specifiek belichting centraal staan in Joker (2019),"['Nabbe, Pleun']","['Copier, Laura']",2022-02-22T00:00:44Z,NL,['belichting; mise-en-scène; onbetrouwbaar vertelperspectief; neoformalisme; device; \npsychologische puzzelfilm'],Film- en Televisiewetenschap,"In deze masterthesis staat de film Joker (2019) centraal waarin de protagonist Arthur Fleck zich ontwikkelt van 
ogenschijnlijk vriendelijke clown tot zijn duistere alter ego van ‘de Joker’. De film wordt in de narratieve structuur 
gekenmerkt door een onbetrouwbaar vertelperspectief, wat bijdraagt aan de grimmige sfeer van Joker doordat het de krankzinnigheid van de protagonist geleidelijk aan het licht brengt. De narratieve structuur werkt samen met en wordt ondersteund door verschillende stijlelementen in de film. Binnen dit geheel van stijlelementen sprongen naar mijn mening de opvallende belichtingselementen eruit die een verband hebben met de graduele 
karaktertransitie van het hoofdpersonage. Belichting is een belangrijke sfeermaker binnen de mise-en-scène van 
Joker en werd de ingang om in meer detail naar deze film te kijken in relatie tot de narratieve structuur van de 
vertelling. De onderzoeksvraag die is onderzocht luidt als volgt: Welke rol speelt mise-en-scène en specifiek 
belichting bij het proces dat de onbetrouwbare protagonist Arthur Fleck in de psychologische puzzelfilm 
Joker (2019) doormaakt en dat leidt tot zijn transformatie in ‘de Joker’? Deze vraag is beantwoord door het 
uitvoeren van een neoformalistische filmanalyse waarbij belichting (binnen de grotere structuur van mise-enscène) als device centraal stond. Eerst is gefocust op hoe het onbetrouwbare vertelperspectief tot uitdrukking komt en welke functie dit vervult binnen de grotere narratieve structuur van de film. Hierbij is Joker bestempeld als een psychologische puzzelfilm en is geconcludeerd dat het onbetrouwbare vertelperspectief zowel kan uitnodigen tot distantie als compassie voor de protagonist. Dit vertelperspectief staat in dienst van het intensiveren van Arthur’s innerlijke belevingswereld, waardoor de toeschouwer wordt uitgenodigd zich meer met het hoofdpersonage te engageren ondanks diens geleidelijk groeiende radicalisering. De sequenties met Arthur’s gefantaseerde optreden in de talkshow van zijn idool Murray Franklin en Arthur’s daadwerkelijke optreden in Murray’s talkshow zijn onderzocht, omdat deze de karaktertransitie van de protagonist kristalliseren. Hierbij is op te merken dat de mise-en-scène en specifiek belichting wordt afgestemd op Arthur’s focalisatie, aangezien deze worden gevormd naar de gemoedstoestand die de protagonist op dat moment ervaart. De filmstijl ondersteunt de vertelling en benadrukt tevens de intensiteit van deze vertelling. De belichting speelt hierbij een cruciale rol in de karaktertransitie van de protagonist. Deze uitgevoerde filmanalyse van Joker (2019) demonstreert de kracht van belichting binnen deze specifieke filmvertelling, waardoor het een bijdrage levert aan het nog beperkte kennisveld omtrent belichting. Een concrete belichtingstheorie ontbreekt volgens filmprofessor Torben Grodal, maar belichting is voor het medium film wel van wezenlijk belang aangezien het één van de krachtigste middelen is om gevoelens en stemmingen op te wekken en te veranderen bij de toeschouwer. Hopelijk kan filmbelichting binnen mise-en-scène een meer vooraanstaande positie genieten in toekomstige filmonderzoeken, aangezien het, zoals in deze masterthesis geïllustreerd, de betekenislagen binnen de zogenoemde ‘unassuming art’ van mise-en-scène verder blootlegt en aantoont hoe onlosmakelijk de narratieve structuur verbonden kan zijn met stijlelementen."
The Effects of Short-termism on Sectoral Problem Shifting,"['Gruben, Thomas']","['Kim, Rak']",2022-02-23T00:00:35Z,EN,['Sectoral Problem Shifting; Enabling Conditions; Short-termism; Multilateral Environmental Agreement; Ozone Depletion; Climate Change'],Sustainable Development,"Multilateral environmental agreements enacted to protect the environment play a crucial role in promoting sustainability. However, as global environmental domains such as climate and ozone are interlinked, policies implemented to address a narrow problem in one domain can shift environmental problems to another domain. Such displacement of problems is increasingly recognized in academic literature as a fundamental challenge to effective environmental policy. However, while spatial problem shifting has received broad attention in literature, cross-sectoral shifting of problems has not, which has motivated the introduction of the sectoral problem shifting concept. Up until now, literature has failed to show which underlying conditions enable problems to shift from one environmental domain to another. A systematic literature review has revealed that, among others, short-termism potentially causes problems to shift from one environmental domain to another. The idea is that the focus on identifying and implementing short-term fixes for urgent environmental problems tends to discount the risk of worsening other environmental problems. To test the influence of short-termism, one clear case of sectoral problem shifting between the Montreal and Kyoto Protocols has been identified, and incorporated in the following research question: How has short-termism influenced the occurrence of sectoral problem shifting from the Montreal Protocol toward the Kyoto Protocol? To answer this research question, a case study analysis has been used which uses data from case studies and reports of the Montreal Protocol COPs and MOPs. Evidence from the case study analysis suggests that short-termism of the delegates of the Parties under the MEA could have enabled sectoral problem shifting from the ozone to the climate regime. Together with the other findings of the literature survey, which revealed fragmentation, a narrow set of indicators, and power imbalance as other potential causal conditions, a broader discussion is promoted on the enabling conditions of sectoral problem shifting between multilateral environmental agreements."
IN VITRO TRANSLATION OF PHOSPHOPEPTIDES AS QUANTIFICATION STANDARD,"['Rietveld, Lin']","['Jongkees, S.A.K.']",2022-02-23T00:00:32Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Phosphorylation is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications and is involved in multiple
biological processes. Several methods have been developed in the field of Mass Spectrometry-based
phosphoproteomics to investigate the phosphoproteome. However, quantification in targeted proteomics
is still facing challenges in synthesizing isotope-labeled peptides as standards for targeted proteomics. The
existing methods to synthesize these can be very expensive and labour intensive. For this reason, a new
method was investigated to synthesize standards in a flexible way. This method makes use of an in vitro
translation system to incorporate stable isotopes in low quantity and to flexibly modify a peptide with
phosphate groups. For that, activated esters of phosphorylated L-serine, L-threonine, and L-tyrosine were
synthesized and shown to be acylated on tRNA by use of catalytic RNA called Flexizymes. The
incorporation of these amino acids was broadly confirmed by translating green fluorescent protein via
stop codon reprogramming. Additionally, reprogramming was also tested by translation a peptide of
Tuberous Sclerosis complex 2 via stop codon suppression and tRNA suppression with an antisense
oligonucleotide, but no phosphorylated product could be confirmed yet. However, multiple tests and
adjustments can still be performed to be able to fully use this method."

Identifying the needs among Dutch pharmacists in clinical decision-making: a qualitative study,"['Bouzeryouh, Salma']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-02-22T00:00:43Z,EN,[],Farmacie,"Background Clinical decision-making is considered a core competence of pharmacists. However, there is limited understanding on what pharmacists need to make clinical decisions. 

Objective The objective of this study was to identify the needs among Dutch pharmacists in clinical decision-making in pharmacy practice.

Methods An explorative, qualitative study was designed. Ten in-depth interviews using semi-structured questions were conducted with pharmacists working in a clinical role in primary or secondary care between August 2021 and December 2021. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was then performed to identify, analyze and report themes within the data.  

Results The findings were categorized into three themes. The first theme, pharmacist’s attributes, included four subthemes: 1- knowledge, 2- skills, 3- attitude and 4- autonomy. The second theme, clinical case, included three subthemes: 1- trigger, 2- patient record and 3- patient conversation. The final theme was the workplace environment with three subthemes: 1- sources, 2- facilities and 3- colleagues.

Discussion In summary, this thesis contributes to the understanding of the needs among Dutch pharmacists in clinical decision-making and introduces aspects that pharmacists could be facilitated in. The preconditions of this model can be further used to support teaching clinical decision-making among pharmacists and pharmacy students."
Predicting the optimal number of MHC proteins against positive and negative T-cell selection via clonotype-based modelling of T-cell repertoire formation,"['Saccheri, Jeroen']","['Boer, Rob de']",2022-02-23T00:00:30Z,EN,[],Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity,"We adapt a previous mathematical model of T cell development with the goal of describing the dynamics of cells that have same fate during thymic selection. The original model considers the survival of a random T cell, using averages of experimental data taken from homozygous mice describing T cell counts at various stages of thymic selection. In the new `clonotype' model we split the original model into cells surviving selection, those not surviving negative selection, and those not surviving positive selection. Solving the fractions of cells in each category from the steady state of the original model, we obtain estimates for the fraction of clonotypes surviving at each stage. These new estimates are input into another updated model that links the number of MHC molecule types to T cell survival. From this, we predict a lower and upper bound for the optimal number of MHC types
to maximise survival. The true number of MHC types observed for heterozygous mice in vivo (≈ 12) falls comfortably in this estimated range (6.5 < M < 15). This suggests that the total number of types of MHC molecule present in an individual
is inuenced by a selection pressure to maximise survival of T cells during positive and negative selection. More generally, the methods used also represent a novel framework by which ODE models of populations may be split into a system of equations for distinct groups with separate outcomes."
Adding PSMA PET CT to nomogram predicting extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer.,"['Swaaij, Sjoerd van']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-02-22T13:00:25Z,EN,['Prostate cancer; extraprostatic extension; PSMA PET CT; nomogram'],Geneeskunde,"Introduction: Probability on extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer determines feasibility of a nervesparing radical prostatectomy. Multiple nomograms have been developed calculating probability of EPE.
Research shows benefits of PSMA PET/CT scans concerning primary staging, but also suggest possible
benefits concerning local staging. Can the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the PSMA
PET/CT improve predictions made by Santeon nomogram?
Materials & methods: A retrospective database consisting of 1400 patients diagnosed with prostate
cancer patients was used. Patients with pre-operatively PSMA PET/CT and MRI prostate were extracted
and analysed.
Results: 117 patients were included and 137 tumour positive sides were identified. EPE was present in
35% of sides and 53% of all cases were deemed T3 according to the MRI report. Multivariable regression
analyses showed that SUVmax is a significant predictor combined with the MRI T stadium to predict
extraprostatic extension (EPE) and improves the area under the curve.
Discussion: Cohort and number of events is small, therefore not all predictors could be included due to
high degrees of freedom. Predictors deemed significant in other studies are not significant in this cohort,
possibly due to small cohort. As SUVmax is significant opposed to other predictors it possesses a certain
predictive value. Cases with non-visible tumours on PSMA PET/CT were not excluded and could possibly
lower true predictive performance of variables.
Conclusion: The relation between SUVmax and EPE is significant and thus strongly suggests SUVmax
could be valuable in predicting side-specific extraprostatic extension."
Towards an Archaeology of Digital Early Music Heritage: Two Case Studies,"['Hart, Delaney']","['Marinescu, R.C.I.']",2022-02-01T00:00:35Z,EN,['musicology; early music; digital humanities; heritage; digitization;'],Musicology,"The digitization of medieval manuscripts and early books has been widely discussed in both musicology and other disciplines, with scholars arguing for both the advantages and disadvantages of creating and using digital surrogates. However, one issue brought up by Zdeněk Uhlíř is that digitization is not just creating digital images but is a “complex activity concerning the presentation of cultural heritage and representation of historical sources.” In this thesis, I examine how digitized early music sources are not just digital images, but also representations and promotions of musical heritage. I analyze two case studies to illustrate and compare how two different digital libraries preserve, advertise, and sustain the digitized musical heritage in their collections. The first case study is the Leuven Chansonnier (B-AF-ms-1), a fifteenth-century songbook thought to have been produced in the Loire Valley region of France. The songbook was digitized by the Alamire Foundation’s digital lab in 2017. It has received considerable support from the Belgian state and city of Leuven to promote the Chansonnier and their research nationally and internationally to reveal the artistry and relevance of early Franco-Flemish musical heritage. The second case study consists of two autographed volumes by the seventeenth-century English composer, Henry Purcell, which are currently held by the British Library. One volume is a manuscript containing keyboard music (MS Mus. 1) by Purcell at one end and the Italian composer, Giovanni Battista Draghi, at the other. The other volume is a scorebook (R.M.20.h.8) containing music written for the courts of Charles II and James II. In 2012, both Purcell manuscripts were digitized. In this thesis, I argue that when dealing with digitized early musical heritage, more consideration should be put into how these digitizations reflect upon and possibly influence current perceptions about musical heritage. I show how the Leuven Chansonnier and Purcell manuscripts have been promoted as cultural heritage and the sociopolitical considerations and motivations behind the preservation and sharing of early musical heritage. In conclusion, this thesis aims to illustrate how such digitizations fit into the larger trend of using digital and virtual methods to protect, access, and research early music sources and heritage."

Netwerk Theorie (ANT). Het tweede hoofdstuk is een inleiding op de tentoonstellingen die
zijn vergeleken: Foto ’37, Film und Foto (FiFo) en Photography 1839-1937. In dit hoofdstuk
wordt ingegaan op de belangrijkste politieke, culturele en kunsthistorische ontwikkelingen in
de moderne kunst - waaronder de fotografie - die invloed hadden op
fotografietentoonstellingen ten tijde van het interbellum. Hierbij zijn de politieke onrust,
Nieuwe Fotografie en Fotografie als Kunst belangrijke thema’s. In het derde hoofdstuk wordt
met behulp van de Actor Network Theorie de tentoonstelling Foto ’37 beschreven. De
resultaten zijn verwerkt in een Actanten Netwerk Overzicht. Opvallende relaties zijn
beschreven. Een interessante bevinding is dat Eva Besnyö een centraal gepositioneerde actant
was met veel invloed. Alle actanten zijn ingedeeld in de thema’s: organisatie, financiën, doel

De resultaten uit dit hoofdstuk zijn vervolgens gebruikt als input voor de vergelijking met de
tentoonstellingen Film und Foto en Photography 1839-1937 in het vierde en laatste
hoofdstuk. Deze twee tentoonstellingen waren geschikt voor een vergelijking met Foto ‘37,
omdat zij alle drie georganiseerd zijn in het interbellum, allen overzichtstentoonstellingen van
de fotografie zijn, allen de nadruk leggen op de fotografische stroming Nieuwe Fotografie en
alle drie internationaal van opzet zijn. De drie tentoonstellingen laten zien wat de
karakteristieke eigenschappen van de fotografie zijn door het geven van voorbeelden van
verschillende fotografische technieken, stijlen en thema’s. Er zijn twee opvallende verschillen
tussen de tentoonstellingen. Film und Foto, de eerste van de drie tentoonstellingen, richt zich
ook op film, wat bij de andere twee tentoonstellingen niet aan de orde komt, ondanks dat Film
und Foto inspiratie was voor Foto ’37 en Photography 1839-1937. Een ander opvallend
verschil is dat Foto ’37 meer dan de andere tentoonstellingen gericht is op de
documentairefotografie. Foto ’37 wil de maatschappelijke rol van de fotografie benadrukken
en zorgt hiermee voor een kantelpunt in de fotografische ontwikkelingen van het interbellum."

Over het algemeen versturen pr-bureaus hetzelfde persbericht naar alle landelijke kranten. Hoewel kranten vaak aandacht besteden aan hetzelfde nieuws, doet elke krant dit op zijn eigen manier. Zo richten zij zich op een andere doelgroep, gebruiken zij een andere invalshoeken en is het tekstcomplexiteitsniveau verschillend (Boukes & Vliegenthart, 2017a). Pr-bureau Bijl PR is benieuwd of de persberichten die zij namens klanten versturen, efficiënter zijn wanneer deze volledig aansluiten bij de krant waar het persbericht naar wordt verstuurd.
Zowel in de volksmond als in de wetenschappelijke literatuur wordt onderscheid gemaakt tussen populaire- en kwaliteitskranten (Bakker & Scholten, 2009). Deze twee typen kranten maken gebruik van andere nieuwsframes in hun berichtgeving (Boukes, Jones & Vliegenthart, 2020). Bij kwaliteitskranten gaat het om de nieuwsframes conflict, impact-en-relevantie, elite- actoren en continuïteit. Bij populaire kranten gaat het om de nieuwsframes personificatie, negativiteit en nabijheid. In dit onderzoek is achterhaald of deze nieuwsframes ook gebruikt kunnen worden om een persbericht op verschillende manieren te presenteren en daarmee waardevoller te maken voor deze twee typen kranten. Hiervoor zijn eerst twee verkennende studies uitgevoerd. Aan de hand daarvan is een experiment opgezet waarin persberichten met verschillende nieuwsframes zijn voorgelegd aan journalisten. In deze persberichten is gebruik gemaakt van het impact-en-relevantieframe, het personificatieframe en het elite-actorenframe. Er is gekeken naar de effecten van de nieuwsframes op de beoordelingen van de journalisten van beide typen kranten op de afhankelijke variabelen: aantrekkelijkheid, begrijpelijkheid, aansluiting bij krant, overname-intentie en mate van aanpassing.
Dit onderzoek toont aan dat nieuwsframes gebruikt kunnen worden om een persbericht waardevoller te maken voor populaire- en kwaliteitskranten. Het toevoegen van een personificatieframe in de vorm van een persoonlijk verhaal, zorgt er namelijk voor dat het persbericht waardevoller is voor journalisten van populaire kranten. Ook het elite-actorenframe zorgt ervoor dat journalisten van populaire kranten het persbericht op sommige afhankelijke variabelen hoger beoordelen dan journalisten van kwaliteitskranten.

OpenPose (pose estimation) and Faster R-CNN Resnet 101 (object detection) are used and the output of both these models are processed and analyzed with machine learning models, Random Forest and Long-Short Term Memory. The Video2Report dataset containing videos of medical actions has been extended with various new actions and other action classes have been complemented with additional recordings. An image dataset containing medical objects was collected (2117 images) and annotated (2956 annotations). Our experiments with object detection models did not result in improvements, possibly caused by a scarcity of images resembling the actual usage scenario. The best performing model proved to be Random Forest with a cross-validated test score of 75.43%. LSTM models reached an accuracy of 63.08%."

This research was originally inspired by Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam’s display of net-based art as it was first encountered by the author in 2019. Across two chapters the factors that contribute to the shortcomings of the Stedelijk’s presentation are analysed, focussing on issues regarding interactivity of the display and the integration of net-based art into the collection presentation. Improvements are sought through application of aesthetic theories and examination of curatorial practices used for past presentations of cybernetic, conceptual, and net-based art.
Approaches that could expand the interactivity of net-based art presentations are arrived at via Katja Kwastek’s aesthetics of interaction and its application to digital art, and through assessments of Jasia Reichardt’s 1968 Cybernetic Serendipity exhibition at ICA London and 1997’s documenta X in Kassel, curated by Catherine David. Jack Burnham’s systems aesthetics and its employment as an organising principle for his Software exhibition at the Jewish Museum in New York in 1970, coupled with Per Platou’s personal approach encountered at the Written in Stone exhibition at Oslo Museum of Contemporary Art in 2003, establish multiple approaches that could be used to improve net-based art’s integration into museum collection presentations.
Museums could improve upon the Stedelijk’s net-based art display by making it more inclusive, intuitive, and tailored to each artwork. By expanding the methodologies of display and by grouping works based on common themes, rather than installation needs, a museum could improve the integration of net-based art into the collection presentation. The text concludes with three proposals for net-based art presentations."

de kwaliteit van het bier op peil te houden door een gebrek aan grondstoffen. Na 1945 werd
er, hoewel de kwaliteit van het bier weer als vanouds was, liever jenever gedronken. En ook
de nieuwe frisdranken waren in trek. Het imago van bier was nog steeds beschadigd door de
slappe troebele drank die in de oorlog voor bier moest doorgaan. Heineken besloot de bierverkoop voor thuisconsumptie te gaan stimuleren. Het product kwam in de schappen van de kruidenier te liggen en de reclame voor Heineken bier veranderde. De focus kwam te liggen op het moderne gegoede middenstandsgezin. Heineken werd synoniem voor gezelligheid en een goede sfeer thuis. De vrouw werd dan ook van harte uitgenodigd om ook te genieten van Heineken. Daarnaast werd het bedrijf zelfbewuster van de gezondheidseffecten van het product dat ze verkochten. Ze begonnen Heineken bier daarom te presenteren als een traktatie. Ook werd het product in advertenties geassocieerd met het comfortabele leven door te verwijzen naar luxeproducten als de televisie en de koelkast."

We produceren met elkaar steeds meer afval. Dit is zonde, want het meeste afval kan goed hergebruikt worden. Een goede oplossing tegen deze afvalberg is het creëren van een circulaire economie. In een circulaire economie draait alles om hergebruiken en wordt geen afval geproduceerd omdat alles opnieuw gebruikt kan worden. Wat voor de één afval is, is voor de ander een waardevolle grondstof. Fungi Factory streeft via samenwerking naar een gezonde stad zonder afval. Ze halen koffiedik op bij lokale ondernemers en gebruiken dit voor het kweken van oesterzwammen. Op die manier zorgen ze ervoor dat een afvalstroom wordt omgezet in een hoogwaardig product. Ze willen dit graag een stap verder nemen door het hergebruiken van hun eigen afvalstroom, het gebruikte koffiedik-oesterzwamsubstraat. Dit substraat is de mix met koffiedik waar de oesterzwammen op groeien en wat overblijft nadat de zwammen zijn geoogst. Mijn onderzoek focust op de toepassingen van ongecomposteerd vers en gecomposteerd substraat in onze voedselteelt. Hiervoor zijn experimenten uitgevoerd met tomaat en sla op twee locaties. In de kassen van de Botanische Tuinen is eerst gekeken naar het effect van het substraat op nog jonge tomatenplanten. De kiemplanten van tomaten zijn bemest met verschillende hoeveelheden substraat en substraat dat in verschillende mate is gecomposteerd. Ook het bodemleven van de potgrond is geanalyseerd met verschillende hoeveelheden substraat. Vervolgens is gekeken naar de late ontwikkeling en de oogst van tomaat en sla in de kassen van de Koningshof. Vers en gecomposteerd substraat verhogen beide het bodemleven van potgrond. Daarbij zorgt een grote hoeveelheid vers substraat voor het meeste bodemleven. De ontwikkeling van de jonge tomatenplanten wordt ook verbeterd door toevoeging van het substraat. Met een kleine hoeveelheid gecomposteerd substraat groeien de kiemplanten al beter dan zonder het substraat. De vroege plantontwikkeling neemt ook toe naarmate de hoeveelheid gecomposteerd substraat toeneemt. Het verse substraat heeft pas een positief effect bij een grote hoeveelheid. Hiernaast zorgt enkele maanden compostering al voor een betere plantengroei dan met vers substraat. Hoe langer het substraat is gecomposteerd, des te beter kunnen de kiemplanten erop groeien. Toch blijkt het substraat de oogst van tomaat en sla te verlagen in de groeikas. De tomatenplanten op het verse substraat produceren minder trossen. Hierdoor verlaagt de opbrengst per plant. Tijdens de volledige ontwikkeling van sla zorgt het gecomposteerde substraat voor een verlaagde oogst. De slakroppen op het verse substraat blijven zo klein dat ze niet geschikt zijn om te oogsten. Kortom, het substraat verbetert het bodemleven en de vroege ontwikkeling van de planten. Aan de andere kant verlaagt het substraat de oogst van de planten. Voordat het substraat toegepast kan worden in de voedselteelt zal meer onderzoek gedaan moeten worden. Dit onderzoek is uitgevoerd in het eerste half jaar van een tweejarig onderzoeksproject. Toekomstige experimenten zullen de overige factoren en het langetermijneffect van het substraat als bodemverbeteraar en meststof in kaart brengen."
Model-Based Difficulty Estimation of Indoor Bouldering Routes,"['Çelik, Resul']","['Kreveld, Marc van']",2022-02-08T01:00:47Z,EN,['Bouldering; Indoor bouldering; Climbing; Grade prediction; Difficulty estimation; Stance; Stance graph; Node graph;'],Game and Media Technology,"In this thesis, we describe an application-specific model to calculate the difficulty of a bouldering route.
Current bouldering routes are graded by the route setters themselves which can introduce a bias. Our
model, on the contrary, uses a set of tailormade rules to find the least-cost path for a given route, and
extracts the difficulty from this path. This thesis introduces a novel data capture method, with which
routes at an indoor bouldering gym can be recorded accurately. We evaluate our model by supplying these
captured routes of varying difficulty to our model and comparing the actual order of grades with the order
of predicted difficulty values. Several models of increasing complexity are tested for an increase in the
accuracy of the difficulty estimation. Our results showed that a model that incorporates the type of each
hold was able to predict the relative order of difficulty for each pair of routes in 70% of the cases."
Perceived environments in reality and online,"['Pudil, Tom']","['Huss, Anke']",2022-02-09T00:00:28Z,EN,"[""perceived environments; online survey; perception of green spaces; clustering effect of people's feelings""]",Toxicology and Environmental Health,"People’s mental state can be affected by their perception of their surroundings, either propagating in other health outcomes or enhancing well-being. This perspective has driven a new discussion about the importance of research on perceived environments, particularly green spaces. The standard method in this field is the use of online surveys, gathering information on people’s perceptions based on Google Street View or the Flicker database. This approach, however, does not question if these assessments limited by the online environment are an accurate representation of reality, with some elements of the actual environment not being carried over. Here, we address whether people’s perceptions differ when comparing their answers from an online survey to answering the same questions in a real-life setting.
The study consisted of three typologically different locations in the city of Utrecht, the Netherlands. In total, 22 participants completed the online survey and subsequently did the assessment in the real-life setting under a researcher’s supervision. The survey was based on 360-degree pictures of these locations with 20 variables to be compared. By recruiting another group of 170 and 228 participants for the online survey, it was possible to examine how different people perceive the same pictures. The pictures were analysed using a deep learning algorithm for object recognition. These data were compared to the participants’ perceptions of natural-like and urban environments assessed in the real-life setting and online, resulting in calculating percentage agreements.
Six variables (Social Connection, Entertainment, Uniqueness, Colours, Cared For, Water) showed a significant (p<0.05) difference between the two settings. The percentage agreements exceeded consistently 50% and were as high as 88% for ‘urban elements’ online. Several perceptual variables developed links with the most prevalent feelings, i.e. a clustering effect of these variables, although not all held against the data from the real-life setting. This pilot study was the first attempt to examine the differences between the real-life setting and online surveys. Discovered differences do not reject using online surveys to study perceived environments, as they were less critical in the overall result interpretation. The main limitations seemed to be the temporal discrepancy of the locations captured by a camera and the assessment in the real-life setting, and the small size of the pictures in the survey layout combined with the lack of other stimuli. These limitations may be resolved by design improvements suggested in this study, yet more robust experiments are needed."

Stimulating climate adaptive community initiatives.,"['Hiemstra, Lineke']","['Mees, Heleen']",2022-02-01T00:00:32Z,EN,['Citizen initiatives; nature-based solutions; neighborhood climate adaptation; framework of \nindividual conditions; green roofs'],Sustainable Development,"Community initiatives have an indispensable role to play in tackling climate adaptation, by their 
ability to increase the uptake of climate adaptation measures among households. This study 
focuses on increasing the uptake of green roofs among households specifically. Despite the
potential of community initiatives in increasing this uptake, they often reach only a small 
portion of a neighborhood. Arguably, by enhancing membership numbers of green roof 
community initiatives, the overall success of green roof implementation in the Netherlands may 
be enhanced as an effective no-regrets adaptation measure. A novel framework of individual 
conditions has created a holistic overview of the relevant individual conditions that move 
people to participate in pro-environmental community initiatives. This study applies this 
framework to a case study in the Dutch city of Deventer. In doing so, this study takes a multimethod in-depth approach that has not been applied to this framework before. This results in an 
understanding of which individual conditions are most important in driving people to join a 
climate adaptation community initiative. The results show that all individual conditions of the 
framework were relevant and led to green roof initiative membership when all present. Yet, the 
most important individual conditions were found to be peer pressure, objective capacity, and 
sense of own responsibility. Accordingly the following aspects were highly influential in this 
case for driving green roof initiative membership: (1) citizens will need to have (access to) the 
required skills, competencies, information and knowledge, and resources to install a green roof, 
(2) citizens will have to feel like participating in such an initiative is part of the social norm of 
the group that they identify themselves with, and (3) they need to believe that they are 
responsible for addressing the issues caused by climate change. These findings were discussed 
with a selection of practitioners to assess their validity and generalizability, and were placed 
within the broader scope of environmental behavior literature. Recommendations for future 
research are provided, as well as recommendations for practitioners that aim to stimulate 
citizens to participate in climate adaptive neighborhood initiatives."

death, political transition led to the birth of a democracy eager to distance itself from 
the dictatorial past and thus claim its place in Europe and in the world. However, a 
decision taken during the agony of the previous regime, motivated by pressing 
circumstances, conditions Spain’s policies and stains its democratic identity: 
Francoist abandonment of Western Sahara amid the Moroccan invasion known as 
the “Green March”. This Thesis employs a model of securitization theory divided into 
three phases -identification of the threat, mobilization against it and 
desecuritization/institutionalization- to explore the effect of political transition in a 
process of securitization through Spain’s case study.
In Chapter I, this theoretical frame is explained and articulated. Then, in 
Chapter II, a display of the internal and external circumstances motivating the 
identification and mobilization of Francoism to securitize the Green March proceed. 
Finally, in Chapter III, a study of the evolution of the Spanish democratic identity in 
relation to the Western Sahara question in Spain’s affairs with Morocco concludes

the body of the work. An analysis of UN documents and resolutions on the issue, 
newspaper articles from a series of journals reflecting relevant events and 
statements, declassified CIA documents concerning important actor’s interests, public

between Spain and Morocco lies at the evolution of the priorities and values defended 
by the different securitizing actors of a dying dictatorship and those of a flourishing

Energy Efficiency Obligation in The Netherlands: Can the implementation be improved?,"['Polinder, Henrieke']","['Runhaar, Hens']",2022-02-05T11:00:32Z,EN,['Energy efficiency; legislation; implementation; The Netherlands'],Sustainable Development,"On European as well as national levels, governments have committed to mitigate CO2 emissions, among others by means of energy efficiency strategies. However, what happens when these strategies are implemented?
This research aims to analyze barriers and opportunities for the implementation of sustainability legislation, and to generate recommendations for improved implementation. It does so by using an evaluative framework. This framework combined the Institutional Framework for Policy Analysis and Design (Polski & Ostrom, 1999) with the framework on indicators for policy implementation of Sabatier and Mazmanian (1980). The framework was used to analyze the case study of the energy efficiency obligation in the Netherlands. This legislation was implemented in 1993, and has been adapted throughout the years. It therefore provides an interesting case for assessing implementation and its effect on policy outcomes. The main research question was: How is the energy energy efficiency obligation of the environmental law articles 2.14c and 2.15 implemented in The Netherlands, and what are the barriers and opportunities for improved implementation? 
A literature review was executed and twenty interviews with officials from the national government, municipalities, and environmental offices were conducted. Using the newly created framework, the policy goals were assessed. Subsequently, the implementation indicators were assessed. By comparing policy goals to policy outcomes, and assessing how implementation indicators contribute to the outcomes, an evaluation of implementation could be made. 
The key implementation variables that were found include the operationalization of policy, the relation between the scale of the policy problem and the government level responsible for implementation, and the way a policy is funded. Recommendations include providing additional and structural funding for energy efficiency law enforcement. Additionally, either the role of municipalities in the execution of the legislation should be limited, or the municipalities should work closer together with the environmental offices. This depends on the way that the legislation evolves in the coming years."

Until recently, existing literature has mainly been focused on monitoring the buildings’ operational energy and carbon emissions. In this study, a variety of environmental and financial implications was researched. The analysis was performed for a conventional and a circular renovation strategy applied to a residential building case study located in Athens, Greece.
The impacts of the two strategies were accessed conducting a Material Flow Analysis (MFA) and a Decision Support System (DSS). The outcomes indicated that applying circularity in the Greek residential building stock is more beneficial from an environmental perspective, whilst from a financial aspect it turned out to be unattractive. Throughout the sensitivity analysis, it was observed that these outcomes are highly dependent from the input data. The national published information on financial data was very limited, while the Hellenic construction material database was incomplete. Therefore, an improvement of the database with publicly open information on EPDs is highly suggested."

Curation or Control: Analyzing the Socioeconomic Context of Recommendation Engines for Cultural Content,"['Voddé, Hester Julia']","['Schaefer, Mirko']",2022-02-08T01:00:31Z,EN,['Recommendation engines; recommender systems; socioeconomics; platforms; Spotify; popularity bias; confirmation bias; subscription-based models; ad-based models; creative industries'],New Media and Digital Culture,"Even though recommendation engines are unmissable when it comes to recommending
either online news or cultural content, there seems to be a different discourse for both spheres. The use of
recommendation engines for selecting and recommending news and information and the potential
problems that come with it are elaborately discussed and studied in public and academic spheres,
but when it comes to the possible negative consequences of recommendation engines for cultural
content both the public and academic debate seem to be largely absent. This thesis scrutinizes the socioeconomic factors that could potentially play a role in this difference in debate. Through the framework of José van Dijck’s analysis of platforms as distinct microsystems I have studied
recommendation engines in their appropriate context. I have scrutinized the socioeconomic elements of music streaming service Spotify and uncovered to which extent they create a different situation than is the case for recommendation engines for news and information.

In doing so, I have found that Spotify is currently in the unique position where their “key user metrics are very strongly associated with diverse listening” since users that are interested in a more diverse musical diet are more likely to pay for a subscription to the platform (Anderson et. al 2156). This unique position could be explained by means of their subscription-based model. This subscription
based model guarantees a certain kind of quality: if the user is paying for a service, in this
case a personalized music experience that is diverse in its recommendations, a platform would
ultimately profit from being as accurate with this service as possible. This is in contrast to platforms
for news and information: as most of these platforms are freely accessible, they
mostly have to rely on user engagement in order to sell more advertisements. The longer users stay
on a platform and interact with it in various ways, the more advertisements can be sold. Therefore,
the platform’s recommendation engines are designed with the goal of engagement in mind. The
guarantee of accurate recommendations disappears when a user is not paying for a specific service,
and recommendation engines that are implemented on platforms that are dependent on advertising
revenues are therefore mostly built to work for the platform itself rather than the user. This
combination of engagement rather than accuracy, the disappearance of a guaranteed quality of
recommendations and the general black-boxed nature of algorithms is a recipe for popular
imaginaries such as the filter bubble, echo chamber, popularity bias or confirmation bias -
imaginaries that heavily shape the critical debate surrounding these recommendation engines for news and information platforms. 

As is a general consensus in the debate surrounding the potential negative consequences of
recommendation engines for news and information, recommendation engines and the algorithms
that they consist of are heavily intertwined with a platform’s socioeconomic context, and more often
than not they are built to work for the platform itself rather than for its users. 
I have found that the socioeconomic elements of my case study Spotify are indeed different
as compared to those of news and information. Not only could my findings offer a possible
explanation for Spotify’s unique position in which the company would profit from more diverse
recommendations, but they have also highlighted the potential of scrutinizing socioeconomic
elements as a way of interpreting an increasingly important debate."

Failure of the EU to initiate structural progress in the accession negotiations forced it to rethink its enlargement strategy for the Western Balkans. The perception amongst EU policymakers that growing Chinese presence in the region has a negative impact on the accession process, consolidated the EU’s transition away from a normative power vested enlargement strategy. Prioritization of the Union’s self-interest was the consequence of the refugee- and European debt crisis. As the EU underwent an identity crisis, it lost the ability to shape what is ‘normal’ in international politics. Elements from the Chinese Western Balkan model have become incorporated into the EU’s enlargement strategy, which since 2018 is centred around material incentives in the form of infrastructure- and energy investments. The EU is reasserting itself as a traditional geopolitical actor in the region, albeit with a focus on economic- rather than military power. The aim of this research has been to contribute to the academic debate on the EU’s role as a global actor by applying the Tocci and Manners typology of four ideal type of global actors to the EU’s enlargement strategy. Moreover, this work builds further on the Tripartite analytical framework and hopes to provide better understanding of the ongoing process whereby the EU is reconstituting its presentation as a global actor based on the reception of its foreign policy."

This work is particularly interesting when placed in the context of explainable AI: In this thesis, I discuss the history, characteristics, and (dis)advantages of classical AI approaches and modern machine learning approaches. The latter have the disadvantage of being a black box, which prevents these approaches from being able to guarantee desirable ethical properties. This problem motivates the research field of explainable AI: the effort of designing AI systems which can compete with modern machine learning approaches in performance, but that are nonetheless explainable (a white box: understandable by humans). I discuss the field in depth, elaborating on which ethical properties are desirable, and which general methods are employed. Then, I give a synopsis of the Apperception system, and assess whether it reaches its objective of formalizing the intuitive notion of 'making sense', after which I place the system in the context of explainable AI, and discuss whether it reaches the goal of combining high performance and explainability. Additionally, I explore potential extensions to the language of the model (specifically to the rules it learns) with the intention of increasing the quality of explanation produced by the system. I conclude that, given the pioneering nature of their work, Evans et al. come close to the goals of creating a high-performing, explainable system that formalizes ‘making sense’, though there are many improvements that may be made. It is (thus) a good (early) attempt at building explainable AI, and may serve as a foundation for future research in this field.

"Intersectional Identities in Western Art Music: Performing Womanhood, Blindness, and Islam in the Al-Nour Wal Amal Chamber Orchestra","['Hart, Madelynn']","['Schuiling, F.J.']",2022-02-01T00:00:33Z,EN,['musicology; disability studies; disability; blindness; Braille; Braille music; Al-Nour Wal Amal; performativity; ideal body; classical music; Western Art Music; WAM; performance practice'],Musicology,"There is a rich history of disability performances outside of music, namely, the freak shows and carnivals of the nineteenth century. Disability studies scholars have examined these “theatrical displays” of disability and have drawn parallels between the social performance of disability and its performance on stage. The performance of disability has been discussed within the field of disability studies, particularly when analyzing the intersection of disability and music, but authors tend to ignore the wider field of identity politics. This is an issue because disability has an intersectional history that is intertwined with issues of race, gender, class, and sexuality.
While these dehumanizing displays and performances of disability no longer exist, I argue that this “freak show” narrative still exists within Western art music (WAM) performance, and when a musician does not fit into the concept of the “ideal” body in WAM, they do not just perform the music, but also their identity. Because I am focusing on repertoire within the Western canon, which Alex Lubet (2010) calls “the most ‘sighted’ musical repertoire the world has ever known,” I am interested in the ways that blind musicians navigate this repertoire without sight. To do this, I take an intersectional approach to music and disability performance, using the Al-Nour Wal Amal Chamber Orchestra as a case study.
The Al-Nour Wal Amal (“Light and Hope”) Chamber Orchestra is an all-female, blind, and majority Muslim orchestra from a school of the same name in Cairo. The group mostly performs music from the Western canon, but the gender, ethnicity, and disabilities of the women in the orchestra place it outside (or on the very periphery) of what is considered “ideal” or even “normal” orchestral praxis. While they do play with a conductor, the Al-Nour Wal Amal Chamber Orchestra has its own way of musicking that is affected by the individual members’ visual impairments. This orchestra serves as a great example of the ways in which disability is deeply intertwined with ethnicity and gender, and how music performance can exacerbate disability performance."

Whereas the correctness of compiler passes follows from the fact that we can recognise compiler behaviour, there is no guarantee that the recognised behaviour is correct. This motivates the need for formal guarantees that express that translation relations themselves are well-behaved.

We use the Coq Proof Assistant to demonstrate how we can prove that a well-behaved translation relation preserves the static and dynamic semantics of programs. In a preliminary study, we show positive results in the context of a simply typed lambda calculus: we define static and dynamic semantics preservation, and we prove both properties for several example translation relations. The main takeaway of this study is that we can use logical relations to express and prove dynamic semantics preservation. 

The preliminary study serves as a starting point for scaling up our methods to a more complex lambda calculus that is based on System 𝐹𝜔𝜇. Though the proof method for dynamic semantics preservation does not scale up easily, we research and demonstrate how step-indexed logical relations solve the issues that arise such that we can define and prove dynamic semantics preservation. Furthermore, we prove static and dynamic semantics preservation for a realistic translation relation.

The semantics preservation proof method is developed for use in a certification engine for the Plutus Tx compiler: a smart contract language compiler intended for commercial use that is developed and maintained by IOHK. As such, we show a promising proof method that can be applied in realistic compilers and verification tools."

Technical difficulties and long vehicle life span prevent next generation technologies significantly
reducing radiative forcing by 2030 and limit the ability their ability to reduce radiative forcing by
2050. Operational policies will save emissions where it is economically sound to do so but are only
capable of marginal efficiencies. Market regulation may reduce flight but mostly in those who rarely
fly, creating further inequality in emissions sources. Carbon offsetting is unlikely to be performed at
a scale to significantly reduce emissions and may be ineffective due to externalities.
If current low carbon strategies, like SAF, are used at a much more ambitious scale aviation
emissions will be reduced. This could allow fewer emissions from the aviation sector until next
generation technologies take over. This could be encouraged by a more effective cap and trade
system like the EU ETS. Ultimately aviation is a very high energy sector which has become a norm
within some groups. A reduction in demand in these groups may be just as important as any
technological, operational or policy measure to reach a world that does not exceed +1.5°C."

Het organisatieprincipe, waarbij de maatschappelijke opgave en de benodigde samenwerking voorop staan, is in staat complexe, maatschappelijke problemen aan te pakken en publieke meerwaarde te creëren. Echter komen bij de implementatie van opgavegericht werken verschillende belemmeringen naar voren, bestaande uit achterliggende mechanismen die nog niet meebewegen met de transitie naar opgavegericht werken. Verschillende publieke organisaties trachten hier oplossingen voor te ontwikkelen in het Gezamenlijk Opgavegericht Academisch Leernetwerk (GOAL-netwerk). Naast steun voor de inhoudelijke opgaven, is voor de verandering naar opgavegericht werken ook steun nodig, om samen te werken aan de maatschappelijke opgaven en om met het nieuwe organisatieprincipe te werken. Het is onduidelijk welke politieke-, prestatie- of professionele acties van opgavemanagers succesvol zijn voor het vergaren van steun voor opgavegericht werken – en daarmee het overkomen van de verschillende belemmeringen.

Dit onderzoek tracht dan ook in kaart te brengen op welke manieren opgavemanagers steun kunnen vergaren voor opgavegericht werken bij verschillende actoren. Deze masterscriptie is daarom gebaseerd op de volgende vraagstelling: Hoe verkrijgen opgavemanagers van publieke organisaties steun voor opgavegericht werken? Door middel van 19 semigestructureerde interviews met opgavemanagers en verschillende typen actoren en twee focusgroepen met experts op het gebied van organisatieverandering en GOAL-netwerkleden is dit kwalitatieve onderzoek uitgevoerd.

Uit het onderzoek bleek voornamelijk dat steunverleners steun verlenen aan opgavegericht werken door politieke- en prestatie acties van publieke managers. Steunverleners zijn vooral vatbaar door meegenomen te worden in de redenen waarom opgavegericht werken werkt. Daarnaast focussen bijvoorbeeld politieke steunverleners zich niet enkel op politieke acties van publieke managers. Het is meer diffuus welke acties steunverleners van belang vinden om opgavegericht werken te steunen. Wat uit het onderzoek ook blijkt is dat niet enkel de opgavemanager verantwoordelijk is voor het vergaren van steun voor opgavegericht werken, maar dat dit een gedeelde verantwoordelijkheid is van verschillende managers in de organisatie/ambtelijke hiërarchie. Kortom, opgavemanagers (en publieke managers in het algemeen) vergaren steun voor opgavegericht werken (of zouden dat het beste kunnen doen) door politieke- en prestatie acties.

Voor vervolgonderzoek is het relevant om het onderzoek met een andere steekproef aan typen actoren uit te voeren. Ook zou een andere context interessant kunnen zijn voor vervolgonderzoek. Ook zijn een aantal randfactoren interessant voor vervolgonderzoek. Zo blijkt dat systemen als een Planning & Control-cyclus en de organisatiestructuur van de ambtelijke organisatie van invloed zijn op het succes van opgavegericht werken. Het onderzoek beveelt GOAL-managers en publieke managers bij publieke organisaties in het algemeen voornamelijk aan om opgavegericht werken goed te definiëren, om te gaan met de focus van steunverleners op het kunnen zien van resultaat (zowel als het gaat om politieke- als prestatie acties/redenen voor steun) en actiever in gesprek te gaan over steun voor opgavegericht werken, in plaats van voornamelijk over steun voor de inhoudelijke opgave."

These substances are released by building materials, paints, furniture, printers and human activities and cause discomfort, headache and contribute to chronic diseases. A solution for this problem, sometimes called the ‘sick building syndrome’, is to properly ventilate the building. Due to practical reasons, design choices, maintenance and energy usage, the level of ventilation is often not high enough. Plants can degrade harmful substances and vegetation may therefore be used together with ventilation systems. Enhancing this air cleaning potential, air blowers may be used to generate an airflow through the growth medium of plants. Indoor vertical plant walls that use air blowers are called biowalls. So far, however, the impact of these walls on microbial composition and abundance has hardly been assessed. Therefore, this research seeks to find an answer on what effect indoor vertical plant walls have on the composition of bacteria and fungi in indoor air. Depending on the number and types of bacteria and fungi this answer may be positive, neutral or negative towards the health of humans.
In this research air samples were taken in buildings with a large collection of plants (botanical greenhouses) and in a controlled closed environment (i.e. an incubator) before and after introduction of plants or a custom built biowall. The abundance and diversity of the microbes in the indoor air samples was determined. These data were compared to the soil- and leaf samples of the plants in the case of the incubator experiments. It turned out that relative humidity of indoor air significantly increased fungal spore load. Moreover, abundance and diversity of fungi, yeasts and bacteria in the air increased after placing and watering plants in the incubator but this was a short-term effect. In the experiment with the longest duration the conditions at day 35 were similar to the starting conditions. Together, this study suggests that the indoor air microbiome and abundance is not affected by biowalls. This “not harmful” outcome does not hamper the use of biowalls to improve indoor air quality."
The Effect of Dynamic Algebra Animation on Learning Outcomes in a Physics Education Video,"['Oosterwijk, Rick']","['Bos, R.']",2022-02-04T00:00:27Z,EN,['dynamic animation; embodied cognition; physics education; algebra;\nconceptual metaphor theory; cognitive load; time dilation'],Science Education and Communication,"Research remains inconclusive as to what extent dynamic animations contribute to an effective
educational video, especially in the context of mathematics and physics. This study investigated
whether and why dynamic animation of algebra is beneficial for grasping topics that hold both an
algebraic and a conceptual challenge. The question was whether video-design based on
conceptual metaphor theory and embodied cognition can improve understanding of both
algebraic manipulations and physical concepts for such topics. In a quantitative experiment 38
bachelor students in chemistry or molecular life sciences watched a designed video about time
dilation in which the involved algebra was animated in either a static way, a dynamic way, or
with animated hands dynamically performing the manipulations. We investigated cognitive load
as a possible explanatory factor for the effects of these different conditions. Analyses of the posttest scores showed significantly higher understanding of the physical concepts in the embodied
dynamic condition compared to the dynamic condition. For algebra scores as well as cognitive
load no significant differences between the conditions were found."

wildly vary between patients making it hard to diagnose. Symptoms of this disease include 
cognitive impairment, spastic paraplegia, and epilepsy, among many others. KAND is caused 
by a genetic mutation in the kinesin family member 1A (KIF1A) gene, which codes for a motor

The Longitudinal Association between Mindfulness and  School Performance: The Moderating Role of Sex,"['Neeskens, Joyce']","['Heu, L.C.']",2022-01-29T00:00:59Z,EN,['Mindfulness; attention during homework; school  performance; sex; moderation; mediation'],Youth Studies,"Previous cross-sectional and experimental studies have associated increased levels of mindfulness in adolescents with several positive effects, including improved school performance. This longitudinal quantitative study additionally examined the potential mediator attention during homework and whether the effects of mindfulness on school performance and attention during homework differed for boys and girls. A sample of 835 participants (Mage = 12.69, SDage = 0.75, 50.3% girls, 49.7% boys) from six secondary educational schools completed self-reported questionnaires three times during a school year in 2014/2015. The study showed that adolescents with higher levels of mindfulness performed better at school. This relationship seemed to be partly explained by attention 
during homework because higher levels of mindfulness predicted better attention during homework which in turn predicted better performance in school. The effect of mindfulness on both attention during homework and school performance did not differ for boys and girls. The results suggest that schools need to become more aware of the potential positive effects of mindfulness, as it can be a promising way to improve adolescent’s performance in 
school. A relevant direction for future research would be exploring further underlying mechanisms of the relationship between mindfulness and school performance."
Shaping the Future: The Mediating Effect of Self-Esteem and the Moderating Effect of Migration Background on the Associations Between Teacher and Family Support and Adolescents' Future Orientations,"['Morris, James']","['Stevens, Gonneke']",2022-01-29T00:00:58Z,EN,"['Adolescent, future orientations, family support, teacher support, self-esteem, migration background']",Youth Studies,"Literature in the field of adolescent future orientations highlights the importance of forming positive conceptualisations about the future as they can act as a buffer for adolescent risk behaviour and may also fuel goal setting and development. The formation of future orientations can be influenced by multiple interacting factors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between family / teacher support and adolescent future orientations. Additionally, this study investigated whether self-esteem explained these associations and whether having a migration background influenced the strength of these associations. Unlike previous studies, future orientations were measured not only by future expectations, but also future emotions. Using data from the Dutch Youth Got Talent survey, linear regression analyses were conducted to investigate these relationships. Results showed that family support was significantly associated with higher future orientations, as was teacher support, although the link for the latter was not as strong as for the former. Self-esteem only partially explained these relationships. Contrary to our expectations, results from moderation analysis showed that having a migration background did not significantly alter the strength of the associations between social support and future orientations. Practical implications are discussed in the final stages of the report."

In addition, peers and an early pubertal development might influence the relation between popularity and alcohol use. However, studies about these moderating factors are limited. In this paper it is aimed to investigate the longitudinal relation between popularity and alcohol use among adolescents and to investigate the effects of having alcohol drinking peers and an early pubertal development within this relationship. The used data is from the first three waves of the Tracking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) and contained 2229 preadolescents in wave 1 (Mage = 11.1, SD = 0.6). Results of the regression analysis showed that whilst popularity predicted an increase in alcohol use of adolescents, this relationship was not stronger for those with drinking peers early pubertal development. It is found that adolescents with more alcohol drinking peers were more likely to drink alcohol themselves. The findings implicate that is important that adolescents find other ways than drinking alcohol to increase or maintain their status."
"Loneliness and the Hofstede Dimension, comparing Mean Loneliness among Adolescents: A Meta-Analysis","['Mooij, Anne']","['Maes, Marlies']",2022-01-29T00:00:57Z,EN,['Loneliness; Adolescents; Hofstede Dimensions'],Youth Studies,"Loneliness is the subjective feeling of having unsatisfactory relationships, and loneliness can negatively influence adolescents’ wellbeing. This analysis examines differences in mean loneliness among adolescents between different countries based on the six Hofstede Dimensions: Restrained, Power-Distance, Long-Term Orientation, Individualism, Masculinity, and Uncertainty-Avoidance with loneliness.
Mean loneliness scores from the MASLO-dataset are compared with countries and the Hofstede Dimensions. The Hofstede Dimensions are retrieved from https://www.hofstede-insights.com. I included 459 studies concerning adolescents and loneliness from 38 countries. Two different analyses were performed, the first analysis examined the Dimensions separately and a second analysis examined the Dimensions altogether. 
First, I found a difference in mean loneliness among adolescents between countries. We found no relation between Power-Distance, Restrained and loneliness. Additionally, we found a positive relation between Masculinity and Collectivism, suggesting people in more Masculine and more Collectivistic countries are more likely to report higher mean loneliness. Final, we found a negative relation between Uncertainty-Avoidance and Short-Term Orientation, implying that people in Low Uncertainty-Avoidance and Short-Term Orientation countries were more likely to report higher loneliness. 
Concluding, cultural differences are associated with differences in loneliness, where Masculinity, Collectivism, Uncertainty-Avoidance and Short-Term Orientation seem the most important."

Gaming has become increasingly popular among youth, with a small portion of them losing control of their behavior, resulting in negative consequences in their day-to-day lives. The current study aims to investigate risk factors associated with increased intensity and problematic gaming. The role of social problems, inattention and hyperactivity problems (IHPs) and sex is examined in relation to gaming behavior. Method. As part of the Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, a nationally representative sample of Dutch adolescent gamers (N = 6435) was utilized. Results. The findings of a stepwise regression analysis suggest a main effect of social problems on (problematic) gaming. The results show that this relation is stronger for those with IHPs. Additionally, boys appear more likely than girls, develop problematic symptoms when gaming to compensate for their social problems. Conclusion. The current study confirms the association of socially vulnerable youth and (problematic) gaming and the influence of IPHs on this relation. Furthermore, evidence suggests that both boys and girls compensate for social problems by playing games, but particularly boys experience problems as a result. Longitudinal studies are required to gain a better understanding of the causality and the direction of the relation."

This is accentuated in the life-period of adolescence since developing one`s identity is the most salient developmental tasks during this time. However, it remains largely unclear whether music preference plays a role in specifically, educational identity and clarity of self-concept.  
Research questions: This research aims to determine whether music preference predicts educational identity and self-concept clarity. This research also examined whether these relationships differed according to gender and school level.
Method: This was examined using a multiple regression analysis and dividing educational identity in three different identity statuses (commitment, exploration and change) whilst also looking at self-concept clarity. The covered music genres were Rock, Heavy Metal, ChartTop40, Jazz, Trance and Hip-Hop. 
Results and conclusion: Music preference predicted self-concept clarity and educational identity, this relationship differed depending on gender and education level (depending on music genre). Rock, Trance, Jazz and Top40 were the music genres that predicted educational identity depending on the educational identity status. Jazz, Trance and Heavy metal predicted self-concept clarity. Gender and school level influences the relationship between music preference and self-concept clarity/educational identity."

Data from the first wave of the Digital Family Project was used. The sample consisted of 397 parents (M = 46.6 years, SD = 5.3) and 396 adolescents (M = 14.4 years, SD = 2.0). The results show that there is no main effect of intensity of social media use on parenting stress. However, higher levels of problematic social media use among adolescents are related to more parenting stress among parents. No moderation by parental self-efficacy is found. It seems that focussing on problematic social media use is important in reducing parenting stress. All in all, this study contributes to the existing literature by showing that problematic social media use is an important factor in understanding parenting stress."

Prior studies show a relationship between parental depressive symptoms and adolescent delinquent behavior. Depressive symptoms might decrease parental monitoring, and this could provide more opportunities for the adolescent to perform delinquent behavior. This current study focused on the role of parental depressive symptoms in predicting adolescent delinquent behavior, while taking parental monitoring and gender into account. Methods. This study was part of the longitudinal TRAILS study. The sample consisted of Dutch adolescents and their parents. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to analyze whether parental depressive symptoms influenced adolescent delinquent behavior, when taking parental monitoring and gender into account. Results. No significant relationship between parental depressive symptoms and adolescent delinquent behavior was found. There was a significant relationship with parental monitoring. Indicating that more depressive symptoms decreased parental monitoring and less monitoring increased adolescent delinquent behavior. Additionally, boys reported more delinquent behavior, compared to girls. Conclusions. These findings demonstrated the importance of the influence of parental monitoring on adolescent delinquent behavior, especially when parents suffer from depressive symptoms. The results demonstrated that boys reported more delinquent behavior. The results stressed the importance to further investigate the gender differences, concerning parental monitoring."

During this developmental phase, forming social relationships is crucial. Friendships can combat loneliness, even possibly long-term. However, interventions focusing on social relationships have not been highly successful. To improve the focus of these interventions, a better understanding of the relation between friendship and loneliness in youth is needed. This meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the current data on this topic. A classical meta-analysis and two moderator analyses were conducted with 62 effect sizes, with a total sample of 18,666 individuals (47.7% male). Results showed a medium overall effect of r = ₋.33. This association with loneliness was stronger for quality of friendship than quantity of friendship. No interaction effect of aspect of friendship and age was found. These findings indicate that a) youth with lower quality and quantity of friendship feel lonelier, b) this relation is stronger when friendship is measured by quality of friendship rather than quantity of friendship, and c) that this is the same for both childhood and adolescent friendships. How these findings contribute to the current understanding of loneliness in youth, and suggestions for future research and interventions, will be discussed."

To answer the research questions, a part of the Digital Youth Project of the University of Utrecht was used. A two-wave longitudinal sample of 11- to 15-year-olds (N = 299) filled in annual online measurements in class. Gaming behavior was measured through items about gaming frequency. The relationship between adolescents and parents were measured through the Family Environment Scale. The quality of gaming-related communication was measured through three items about the Quality of Communication about gaming. Arguments between adolescents and parents was measured through one item from the Family Environment Scale. Regression analysis showed that gaming behavior was linked to a weaker relationship between adolescents and parents. Regression analyses also showed that adolescent gaming behavior did not significantly predict the quality of communication about gaming and arguments between adolescents and parents. Quality of communication about gaming and arguments between adolescents and parents were also not significant predictors for the adolescent-parent relationship. Therefore, the quality of communication about gaming as well as arguments between adolescents and parents were no mediators in the relationship between adolescent gaming behavior and the adolescent-parent relationship. Despite the fact that adolescent gaming behavior and the adolescent-parent relationship are related, it is not yet clear what this relationship looks like in terms of other factors that come into play."
Developing and evaluating a Musical Attention Control Training computer game application,"['Chalkiadakis, Ermis']","['Volk, Anja']",2022-02-17T00:00:29Z,EN,"[""NMT; MACT; Serious Games; Cognitive Training; Attention Training; Parkinson's Disease; Music Therapy; Video Games;""]",Game and Media Technology,"Recently, Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) has been a prominent intervention for alleviating cognitive impairment symptoms. Specifically, Musical Attention Control Training (MACT) has been shown to alleviate attention control problems of participants, such as Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients. However, regularly attending MACT sessions can be challenging, which is further exacerbated by the current global pandemic. The question arises as to how the benefits of MACT can be more easily accessible. Serious games have proven to be a successful intervention for cognitive impairments. However, to this day, there is no serious game that is based on NMT. In this study, a novel approach was followed to research the plausibility of and develop a serious game that emulates an MACT session and is tailored to the needs of PD patients. Afterwards, an experiment was conducted to gauge the game intervention’s efficacy in attention control training. Participants (n=13) were asked to play the game for three weeks and complete a questionnaire and three attention tests before and after the play sessions. Gameplay, questionnaire and attention test data were collected and analyzed in order to draw conclusions about the game’s efficacy. Results indicate a positive trend in sustained and selective attention among participants. These results show that gamified MACT could be a promising supplement to conventional MACT for improving the quality of life of attention-impaired patients."
Holographic Entanglement Entropy using Bit Threads,"['Pinto, Aylon']","['Gursoy, U']",2022-02-17T00:00:31Z,EN,[],Theoretical Physics,"It is known that the entanglement entropy of a region in a CFT can be holographically mapped to the Ryu-Takayanagi(RT) surface. This is the minimal surface in AdS homologous to the entangling region. In this project, we use the bit thread interpretation of the RT formula. We investigate if it can be used to find a more concrete algorithm for calculating the entanglement entropy of a given entangling region. Our first results are promising, recovering the right bit thread configurations for specific cases in time slices of two and three-dimensional CFT's. However, a careful analysis reveals that a generalization to arbitrary entangling regions should be shape-dependent. For the case of a three-dimensional CFT, the bit thread prescription suggests a generalized Biot-Savart law that depends on the local curvature of the entangling surface."
I am a Political Prisoner: ‘Illegitimate’ Securitisation During the 1981 Maze Prison Hunger-strike,"[""O'Mahony, Emma""]","['Graaf, Beatrice de']",2022-02-16T00:00:30Z,EN,['Legitimacy; securitisation theory; counter-securitisation; Northern Irish conflict; Irish Republican Army.'],International Relations in Historical Perspective,"This thesis seeks to address the problematic connection between securitisation theory and legitimacy. Specifically, this research challenges the theory’s assertion that securitising actors must be ‘legitimate’ actors, and does so through an analysis of the 1981 Maze Prison Hunger-strike carried out by republican prisoners, specifically focusing on the hunger-strike of Irish Republican Army (IRA) member Bobby Sands. So, the central research question is: ‘How does securitisation theory’s hyper-focus on ‘legitimate’ actors fail to account for the IRA’s counter-securitisation during the 1981 Maze Prison Hunger-strike, and how can an analysis of this event provide a broader understanding of legitimacy within securitisation theory?’ To answer this question, a framework has been constructed based on conceptions of legitimate entities and legitimate security, as well as securitisation theory and counter-securitisation. Through a qualitative analysis of how the IRA ‘spoke security’ to and mobilised their audience during Sands’ hunger-strike, this thesis finds that ‘illegitimate’ groups can counter-securitise, namely through the strategic exploitation of lines of communication with their relevant audience and the utilisation of cultural and religious messaging that may hold particular weight for said relevant audience. This research thus proposes amendments to securitisation theory in order to account for this, these being: understanding legitimacy as a target of (counter-)securitising moves, broadening the scope of relevant audiences within securitisation theory, and removing the prerequisite that a (counter-)securitising actor must be a state representative or political elite. The findings of this research may create the opportunity for more in-depth academic analysis of processes of securitisation carried out by groups that are considered to be illegitimate, and also may provide governments and relevant authorities with a further understanding of how ‘illegitimate’ groups appeal to their relevant audiences and ignite societal mobilisation."
The Dark side of Dark Tourism,"['Ferdinandus, Nadeshe']","['Meijers, Evert']",2022-02-15T00:00:30Z,EN,['Dark Tourism development; Economic benefits; Ethical dilemmas; \nEthical critiques; Tourism.'],Human Geography,"Tourism and its industry have been around for a long time and has been growing 
over the last decades, becoming part of the experience economy. Dark Tourism, 
being a relatively new and popular sub-category, consists of many different 
types of destinations. This form of tourism attracts many visitors and has its 
economic benefits to those working in the sector and the area where such a 
destination is located. However, Dark Tourism often goes hand in hand with 
ethical dilemmas and critiques, such as the gain of economic profits and the 
behavior of the visitors. This conflict, regarding the potential development of the 
Dutch Dark Tourism industry, is therefore the main goal of this thesis paper.

A dataset has been acquired through an online survey, distributed through 
social media. A variety of questions, regarding Dark Tourism interests, previous 
visits, economic factors, and behavior, were filled in by 203 respondents. In 
addition, an interview with a respondent working in the tourism industry was 
held in order to gain more background information. The data was then analyzed 
with the use of SPSS and interpreted based on the research questions.

The results of this research show that the most popular and visited form 
of Dark Tourism are destinations that fall into the darkest category of Dark 
Tourism. Hence, future Dark Tourism development should focus mainly on the 
darkest form of Dark Tourism. However, this has its limitations, as one cannot 
simply ‘copy’ popular destinations such as Auschwitz or Chernobyl. Even though 
the lighter forms of Dark Tourism are less popular potential destinations 
amongst the respondents, they are often visited and are therefore an area of 
growth for the Dutch Dark Tourism industry. Profits can be made but should be 
used for the preservation and education of the area. Potential visitors of such 
destinations should be warned and reminded of how to behave in a desirable 
manner. Behavior while visiting a Dark Tourism destination is an area that often 
receives critiques. However, according to this research, the Dutch population 
often acts in a respectful manner.

Furthermore, this thesis leaves room for potential further research. Onsite observations would be of informational value as an addition to the survey. In 
order to make the survey 100% representable for the Dutch population, a more 
controlled manner of distributing the survey should also be executed.

Lastly, many respondents visited the Dark Tourism destinations as part of 
a larger trip organized by educational institutions. Therefore, these institutions 
should focus on education the children on the history of such Dark Tourism 
destinations, and on how to behave respectfully while visiting. 
These conclusions and recommendations signify the potential of the 
development of the Dutch Dark Tourism industry, while maintaining the ethical 
standards and staying within the ethical boundaries."

For this second algorithm, we use a path finding method introduced by Björklund et al. for returning a cycle that passes through a provided list of specified elements. This method runs in fixed parameter tractable time. Finally, we test both algorithms on a test set and perform a short comparative study on the results."

these simple regulatory networks further, in this review, I want to push the frontier of synthetic
development by proposing the pursuit of building a segmented elongated tissue. This would be
the largest and most complex structure built using the principles of synthetic development. By
exploring this pursuit, we can create a better perspective on what tools we need to develop and
which ones we already have to create more complex tissues, in general. In particular, I will discuss
module construction, linking modules, and computational tools. Overall, the ability to engineer
complex tissues would open up the true potential of synthetic development."

Een onderzoek naar lichamelijkheid in enkele Nederlandstalige koloniale romans rond 1900","['Hendriks, Corinne']","['Sonnenschein, Johan']",2022-02-16T00:00:28Z,NL,['kolonialisme; intersectionaliteit; imagologie; lichamelijkheid; De stille kracht; Tropenwee; De zwarte kost; Louis Couperus; Henri van Booven; Cyriel Buysse; Joep Leerssen; Gloria Wekker;'],Neerlandistiek,"Lichamelijkheid speelt een prominente rol in veel, zo niet alle koloniale literatuur rond 1900. Ras/etniciteit, gender, seksualiteit, gezondheid en ziekte zijn aspecten van lichamelijkheid die steeds terug te vinden zijn in koloniale romans van die tijd. Ze onderscheiden de individuele witte hoofdpersonages van de kolonie waarin ze verblijven en de gekoloniseerden die ze ontmoeten. De kolonie kan op haar beurt kan gezien worden als een lichaam met haar bevolking, landschap en culturen die door de witte Europese personages als een entiteit ervaren wordt die hen ten gronde richt.
	Er worden drie koloniale teksten tegen het licht gehouden waarbij de vraag gesteld wordt: Hoe worden lichaam en kolonie verbeeld in Nederlandstalige koloniale romans rond 1900? De teksten die worden onderzocht zijn: De stille kracht (1900) van Louis Couperus, Tropenwee (1904) van Henri van Booven en De zwarte kost (1898) van Cyriel Buysse. Om tot een antwoord op de centrale vraagstelling te komen, worden enerzijds de lichamen of ‘lichamelijkheid’ van de verschillende witte mannelijke hoofdpersonages binnen de drie romans onderzocht. Anderzijds wordt er een antwoord gezocht op de vraag hoe de kolonie als lichaam gerepresenteerd wordt en welke visie er spreekt over de kolonie per casus.
	In dit onderzoek wordt een dekoloniale intersectionele benadering met imagologische invloeden toegepast die hermeneutisch van aard is. Deze benaderingen vormen een nuttige aanvulling op elkaar en het soort onderzoek dat hier bedreven wordt. De theoretische basis ligt bij Gloria Wekker en haar visie op intersectionaliteit en white innocence en Joep Leerssens imagologische concepten. In een poging het onderzoek over de landsgrenzen heen te brengen en tot een meer vergelijkende neerlandistiek te komen, is er bewust voor gekozen niet alleen Nederlandse teksten te analyseren, maar ook een Vlaamse. 
	De hier toegepaste benadering is nieuw en wordt getest op effectiviteit in de analyse van de drie gekozen koloniale teksten. De benadering kan voor de analyse van alle koloniale romans waarin ziekte een rol speelt toegepast worden en heeft niet slechts betrekking op de drie casussen die in dit onderzoek geanalyseerd worden. 	
	Er worden drie deelanalyses uitgevoerd waarbij steeds gekeken wordt naar de verbeelding van ras/etniciteit, gender, seksualiteit, gezondheid en ziekte van de hoofdpersoon; naar de verbeelding van gekoloniseerden, de koloniale natuur en de kolonie als natie; en ten slotte hoe het lichaam van het hoofdpersonage en de kolonie als lichaam op elkaar betrokken worden. Voor de analyse van deze verbeeldingen is focalisatie van belang, daarbij is steeds indachtig gehouden dat de focalisatie in deze teksten voornamelijk gebeurt door het witte mannelijke hoofdpersonage en/of de vertelinstantie die zijn oorsprong vindt in een witte mannelijke auteur. Het biedt een specifiek perspectief op de kolonie en de plaats daarin voor de witte Europese man. 
	De verbeelding van de witte Europese man en de kolonie komen in de geanalyseerde werken in grote lijnen overeen met elkaar. De witte mannelijke hoofdpersonages raken ontgoocheld en gaan moreel en/of fysiek ten onder. De kolonie is een geheimzinnige of irrationele plaats. De gekoloniseerden zijn ontoegankelijk en onkenbaar. Het koloniale systeem maakt zowel kolonisatoren als gekoloniseerden kapot. De drie werken tonen allemaal hoe koloniale verbeelding ontstaat, doorwerkt, steeds opnieuw geproduceerd wordt en zo het bestaande koloniale systeem in stand houdt. De voor dit onderzoek nieuw ontwikkelde methode laat vooral zien hoe gelaagd de koloniale verbeelding in deze teksten is.

For our research, we apply our approach of automated agent-based testing, on NethackClone, a 2D, grid-based video game. Our  implementation utilizes the Iv4xr framework, a tool that is able to apply and generalize automated testing on multiple types of video games, enabling us in that way to perform agent-based testing on the game, by creating agents and assigning goals to them. Alongside the testing tasks we implemented for our project, we also perform a number of checks on the SUT, checking whether the game behaves as intended when specific actions
take place in it. Checks are related to the interaction between the player and the main elements of the game. We
created two different tests, with 7 goals and more than 25 actions, tactics and utilities, running our experiments on a total of 307 unique test cases (171 on Test 1, 136 for Test 2). We evaluated our approach based on 3 main factors: coverage, success ratio and time, while the time and eort the framework needs to adapt for a new game each time is also of interest to us. Results derived through the experiments proved not only that our approach performs efficiently at a considerable level, but also our system was even able to detect an actual, unknown bug in the game. The functionality and the ability of the framework to adjust and generalize for
multiple games is also promising, considering factors such as updates and adjustments on a game, or similarities between video games. The eort and time we devoted to the framework proved out to be a one-time investment, as once the integration of the SUT into the framework is complete, it can be repeatedly used for creating new testing tasks, checking on different assets of the game. In this way it can assist testers save important time and eort in further, future tests on the same SUT. However, our study also pointed out existing
malfunctions in our approach, since our research was limited in terms of time and computational power, proving
the need for extended research on a huge number of tests and test cases, in possible future studies."

Showing each survey question individually improves survey completion. None of the manipulated variables affect attitudes towards mental illness, but framing “mental” as “health” decrease respondents’ willingness to seek and recommend professional help. Awareness of mental illnesses is correlated with willingness to seek and recommend help, but not with attitudes towards mental illnesses. Age is correlated with willingness to seek help and negatively correlated with awareness of attitudes towards mental illness. Women show higher levels of awareness of and more positive attitudes towards mental illness than men and a female vignette receive more positive attitudes than a male version from all genders. Finally, the order of the agreement options is found to positively affect respondents’ agreeance when ordered from agree to disagree.

OPTIONS FOR IMPROVING THE DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT AND HUSBANDRY OF HORSES IN THE NETHERLANDS,"['Woude, Trix van der']","['Eerdenburg, Frank van']",2022-02-18T00:00:29Z,EN,"['Welfare, Horse, Conspecifics, Free movement']",Gezondheidszorg paard,"To improve the welfare status of horses in the Netherlands, it is useful and important to learn more about their day-to-day activities in relation to owners’ attitudes, opinions and possibilities. Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to give an insight in the  day-to-day management and husbandry of an average horse in the Netherlands and to describe the options for improving this management and husbandry, with a focus on free movement and social contact. Besides describing the options for improvement, this study will investigate  whether horse owners’ practices correspond with their opinions on the influence of free movement and contact with conspecifics on the welfare of horses.
An online survey was prepared and made accessible for Dutch horse owners, which resulted in 3774 complete responses in a period of almost 2 months in 2021. Together, the respondents were responsible for 3.6% of the Dutch horse population. 40 respondents were selected for a follow-up interview.
80% of the respondents was satisfied with the amount of movement they gave their horses. Owners keeping their horses at paddock paradises or nature reserves were most satisfied. Least satisfied were owners keeping their horses at riding schools. When the respondents gave their horses a higher amount of free movement, their satisfaction increased. 
Owners keeping their horses individually chose “strongly agree” less frequently than owners keeping their horses in groups on the statements regarding contact with conspecifics. When focusing on the statements regarding free movement, owners giving no free movement chose the option “strongly agree” less frequently than owners who gave their horses 22 – 24 hours/day of free movement.
From the interviews became clear that 15/40 respondents gave their horses free movement individually, this was mostly due to owners being afraid of their horses getting injured when given free movement with conspecifics. Of the 31/40 respondents, that did not give their horses free movement for 24 hours a day, most mentioned as reasons “the weather is not good enough” and “horses get bored and/or restless”. Of the 32/40 respondents, that did not keep their horses on pasture permanently, most mentioned that it was due to not having enough grass or the pastures being too wet. 
Improvement can be made by transferring more scientific knowledge to owners of horses, for example by their veterinarian. For future research it would be interesting to investigate how horses are kept earlier in life and explore which improvements can be made at the onset of horses’ social life."
Improved motion-compensated MRI and image processing for mid-position lung radiotherapy,"['Bochove, Aart van']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-02-22T00:00:31Z,EN,"['Lung, radiotherapy, MRI, mid-position, cardiorespiratory triggering, image processing']",Medical Imaging,"Introduction 
Cardiorespiratory motion causes large positional uncertainty in radiotherapy of the thoracic and abdominal regions. Respiratory-induced uncertainty reduces when treating in the time-weighted average/mid-position (midP) anatomy. This thesis investigates combining a coarse resolution T2w respiratory-correlated 4D-MRI with a high-resolution end-exhale triggered T2w MRI scan (MVXD), to yield a high-resolution midP. Furthermore, including cardiac triggering during MVXD acquisition is proposed. The quality and feasibility of higher-resolution midP and cardiorespiratory triggered MVXD are assessed. 
 
Methods & materials 
The respiratory-triggered MVXD and a 4D-MRI were acquired for thirteen patients and two healthy volunteers. MidP images, constructed by warping the 4D-MRI phases to the MVXD scan using deformable image registration, were compared to midPs created conventionally by only using the 4D-MRI. The consistency of the deformable vector fields (DVFs) was assessed using the distance discordance metric (DDM). 
Five healthy volunteers were scanned with a cardiorespiratory-triggered MVXD, where the 1D-navigator was placed on the left ventricle (LV) instead of the liver-lung (LL-)interface. 2D cine-MRI images were used to determine residual motion. Three observers assessed the MVXD image quality. 
 
Results 
When including the MVXD in midP calculations, MidP resolution increased nine-fold, yielding sharper images compared to 4D-only midP-MRI. DDM values increased (8% DDM values >2 mm to 17% >2 mm), signaling reduced DVF consistency, mostly in areas with pulsatile flow (heart, blood vessels) and ghosting (skin), as expected. 
Using LV-based cardiorespiratory triggering, halved the LL- and LV-motion compared to no triggering. According to observers, changing LL-triggering to LV-triggering caused improved heart sharpness in the MVXD images, while LL-interface sharpness decreased slightly. Average scan time increased from 5:46 to 5:51. 
 
Conclusion & Discussion. 
Involving MVXD in midP calculations increases midP image quality, but DVF consistency slightly reduces, probably due to contrast differences between the scans. Using cardiorespiratory triggering increases MVXD quality around the heart.  
Including the MVXD scan in midP calculation is feasible and useful, and applying cardiorespiratory triggering can increase MVXD quality."
The effect of the O-antigen of LPS to Host Defense Peptides,"['Pannekoek, Arianne']","['Veldhuizen, Edwin']",2022-02-18T00:00:28Z,EN,['Host Defense Peptides; HDP; Antimicrobial peptides; AMP; Lipopolysaccharide; LPS; O-antigen;'],Geneeskunde van gezelschapsdieren,"Recent theories suggested that activity of host defense peptides is enhanced by the presence of an O-antigen. In this study, HDP activity was correlated to binding affinity of HDPs to LPS with and without an O-antigen. The results showed no significant differences between with bacteria or LPS with an O-antigen and bacteria or LPS without an O-antigen.

Een aantrekkelijke openbare ruimte kan sporten in de buitenlucht aanmoedigen en hardlopen blijkt een voor de hand liggende keuze. Wil een gemeente zijn beleid kunnen richten op het promoten van fysieke activiteit door ingrepen in de omgeving, dan moet het bekend zijn wat een omgeving aantrekkelijk maakt voor hardlopers. Dergelijke onderzoeken zijn vooral kwantitatief uitgevoerd en stuiten op een drietal problemen: ten eerste wordt de sociale omgeving niet of onvoldoende meegenomen; ten tweede wordt ook geen rekening gehouden met de motivatie van de hardloper; en ten derde worden de fysieke omgeving, de sociale omgeving en de persoonsgebonden factoren niet als zijnde met elkaar verweven onderzocht. Er is daarom behoefte aan een meer kwalitatieve benadering. 

In dit kwalitatieve onderzoek wordt aan de hand van een case study geanalyseerd hoe hardlopers een speciaal ingerichte buitensportroute beleven en gebruiken. Het heeft als doel meer inzicht te verkrijgen in het gebruik en de beleving van de speciaal voor buitensport ingerichte openbare ruimte door hardlopers. Deze kennis kan een bijdrage leveren aan de inrichting van buitensportroutes en de algehele openbare ruimte. Eerst is onderzocht hoe de buitensportroute gepland en bedoeld is om gebruikt te worden. Dit is gedaan met een interview met de projectleider. Vervolgens is de invloed van persoonsgebonden factoren, factoren uit de fysieke omgeving en factoren uit de sociale omgeving geanalyseerd met behulp van op locatie afgenomen interviews met hardlopers.

In dit onderzoek worden diverse factoren op een rijtje gezet die de ervaring en beleving van het hardlopen en het gebruik van openbare ruimte beïnvloeden. Buitensportroutes met speciale voorzieningen blijken door de meeste hardlopers erg aantrekkelijk gevonden te worden. Tegelijkertijd komt uit dit onderzoek naar voren dat er onder hardlopers grote verschillen zijn in voorkeuren, motieven en ervaringen, wat leidt tot een rijke oogst aan bevindingen."

Natuurbeschermingsorganisaties hebben bij uitstek te maken met een complexe realiteit met verschillende doelen en stakeholders. Naast natuurdoelstellingen is er ook een sociale en een economische dimensie waartoe zij hun natuurdoelstellingen moeten verhouden, ook wel de triple bottom line genoemd. Groene NGOs hebben te maken met interne spanningen tussen de natuurdoelen enerzijds en de sociale en economische dimensie anderzijds. Binnen de context van toenemende spanningen tussen natuurdoelen en de sociale en economische dimensies wordt het voor NGOs steeds belangrijker hier goed mee om te gaan. Traditioneel gezien worden deze spanningen vaak ontkend door vast te houden aan win-win kansen of door het denken in dilemma’s bij de omgang met spanningen. De paradox theorie biedt een alternatief perspectief op de omgang met spanningen binnen de organisatie. De paradox theorie stelt dat langdurig succes in een organisatie enkel bereikt kan worden door een continue inspanning om gelijktijdig tegemoet te komen aan meerdere divergente vereisten. Binnen dit onderzoek is onderzocht hoe medewerkers van natuurbeschermingsorganisaties in het licht van de paradox theorie omgaan met interne spanningen tussen natuurdoelen én de sociale en economische dimensie. Ter ondersteuning hiervan is in relatie tot de paradox theorie onderzocht wat de belangrijkste (achterliggende) factoren zijn die invloed hebben op interne spanningen binnen groene NGOs en op de manier waarop medewerkers daarmee omgaan. Deze vragen werden in dit onderzoek beantwoord door middel van een interpretatieve benadering en kwalitatief onderzoek. De data werden verzameld middels dertien individuele semigestructureerde interviews met medewerkers van verschillende natuurbeschermingsorganisaties. Ten aanzien van de contextuele factoren bleken de meeste natuurbeschermingsorganisaties in een context te verkeren waarin verborgen tegenstellingen zichtbaar worden onder invloed van schaarste, verscheidenheid en verandering. Relevante factoren bij de omgang met interne spanning bleken de achtergrond van de medewerkers en groene NGOs, de relatie tussen interne en externe spanning, de kwetsbare positie van groene NGOs, ideologische verschillen en de behoefte aan duidelijkheid. Daarnaast bleek dat op het niveau van de medewerker een relevant onderscheid is te maken tussen meer principiële donkergroene medewerkers en meer pragmatische lichtgroene medewerkers. Met betrekking tot de omgang met spanningen concludeer ik dat elementen uit de paradox aanpak terugkomen in de manier waarop medewerkers van natuurbeschermingsorganisaties omgaan met interne spanningen tussen natuurdoelen én de sociale en economische dimensie. Zo leken de medewerkers de interne spanning serieus te nemen. Verder is gevonden dat veel respondenten beide zijden binnen het spanningsveld integreren en er een constructieve houding op nahouden in de beschrijving van hun aanpak. Daarnaast is gebleken dat de medewerkers in staat zijn om onderliggende spanningen te herkennen en te beschrijven. Tot slot worden in de conclusie nog enkele voorwaarden gesteld. De paradox theorie kan van toegevoegde waarde zijn voor de verdere omgang met spanningen binnen natuurbeschermingsorganisaties indien aan deze voorwaarden kan worden voldaan."
Leren van visiteren. Een kwalitatief onderzoek naar de werking en doorwerking van visitaties op het organisationeel leervermogen van publieke professionele organisaties.,"['Krol, Emma']","['Noordegraaf, Mirko']",2022-03-15T00:00:54Z,NL,['visitaties; publieke professionele organisaties; organisationeel leren; organisationeel leervermogen'],Publiek management,"Overheidsorganisaties hebben een plicht jegens de politiek en maatschappij om optimale resultaten te boeken en daar verantwoording over te kunnen afleggen, omdat overheidstaken (deels) middels publieke gelden worden gefinancierd. De verantwoordingsdruk lijkt alsmaar toe te nemen, door ontwikkelingen als internationalisering, individualisering en mediatisering. De samenleving is kritischer en maatschappelijke verbanden zijn losser; de gezagsverhouding tussen overheid en burger verandert. Voor publieke organisaties met een hoog professioneel karakter – zoals het Openbaar Ministerie (OM) – is het een lastige balanceer-act om enerzijds met de tijdgeest mee te blijven gaan en tegelijkertijd te voldoen aan eisen als stabiliteit, kwaliteit en rechtszekerheid. 

Een manier om de buitenwereld meer inzicht te verschaffen in hoe organisaties te werk gaan is de visitatie. Bij een visitatie evalueert en waardeert een onafhankelijke commissie van deskundigen hoe een organisatie presteert en wat aandachtspunten zijn voor prestatieverbeteringen en organisatieontwikkeling. Een visitatie leent zich in beginsel dus goed voor leren. Echter, leidt het niet automatisch tot realisatie van de leerpotentie. Strategisch en/of defensief gedrag of tussenkomst van andere prioriteiten zijn risico’s die een visitatierapport in de bureaula kunnen doen verdwijnen. 

Met dit onderzoek is getracht inzicht te krijgen in de relatie tussen visiteren en het leervermogen van een publieke professionele organisatie. De centrale onderzoeksvraag in deze scriptie is: Op welke wijze en onder welke omstandigheden kan een visitatie bijdragen aan het organisationeel leervermogen van een publieke professionele organisatie?

Ter beantwoording van de onderzoeksvraag is literatuur bestudeerd over (organisationeel) leren, leervermogen, de lerende overheid en visiteren. In de theorie wordt benadrukt dat leervermogen een kwestie is van bevorderende en beperkende factoren die zowel leerstructuur als leercultuur beïnvloeden. Teneinde organisationeel leervermogen te versterken, is de opgave om de leerstimuli aan te moedigen en te internaliseren en anderzijds leerblokkades te doorgronden en op te heffen om de kennisstroom binnen een organisatie te optimaliseren en relevante kennis wordt opgeslagen in het organisatiegeheugen. Op basis van de theorie zijn twee conceptuele modellen opgesteld voor leervermogen alsmede de relatie tussen visiteren en leervermogen.

Het empirisch onderzoek is gericht op bij de rechtspraak betrokken organisaties, aangezien de (wetenschappelijke) literatuur vooralsnog gericht is op visitaties in andere publieke sectoren. Middels interviews en documentenanalyse is met nadruk inzichtelijk gemaakt op welke manier het visiteren bijdraagt aan het leervermogen van het Openbaar Ministerie, aangezien het OM recent aan een visitatie is onderworpen. Dat was de nasleep van de commissie Fokkens, die het OM kritisch analyseerde nadat enkele affaires waren blootgelegd. De onderzoeksresultaten tonen aan dat de bijdrage voor het leervermogen meervoudig kan zijn."

Hierdoor is een lang weggestopt probleem aan het licht gekomen: er is te lang, te weinig aandacht gegeven aan goede interne communicatie. Bedrijven zoals XXXXX zijn zich daar nu maar al te bewust van en willen er alles aan doen om ook vanuit huis een effectieve samenwerking tussen medewerkers te realiseren.

XXXXX is een afdeling binnen XXXXX die de interne communicatie onder werknemers wil verbeteren. Daarom is er afgelopen zomer een nieuwe samenwerkingsstrategie geïntroduceerd, die het creatieproces van campagnes moet versoepelen. Het idee van de samenwerking is om de mensen die ieder voor een ander deel van het creatieproces verantwoordelijk zijn, in groepen te laten samenwerken. Zo ontstonden er zogenaamde ‘driehoeken’: groepen van drie personen, bestaande uit een Retail Media Manager, Campagne Manager en Project Manager. Deze groepen kregen ieder een specifiek cluster toegewezen (zoals Elektronica of Lifestyle & living) en werden verantwoordelijk voor alle accounts die onder dat cluster vallen. Als stok achter de deur kwam iedere groep wekelijks samen in een vergadering, om de huidige ontwikkelingen rondom de campagnes te bespreken. Volgens XXXXX is deze vorm van samenwerken dé manier om de interne communicatie te verbeteren en daarmee ook het creatieproces te versoepelen. Of deze techniek ook het gewenste effect heeft gehad? Dat heb ik het afgelopen half jaar onderzocht.

Voor dit onderzoek is de samenwerking van drie verschillende ‘driehoeken’ geanalyseerd. Hiervoor zijn gedurende twee maanden in totaal twaalf vergaderingen bijgewoond, gedocumenteerd en geanalyseerd. Vervolgens zijn met alle deelnemers van de drie groepen diepte-interviews gehouden over hun visie op de samenwerking. Deze interviews zijn getranscribeerd en geanalyseerd, om zo het beeld van de deelnemers te vergelijken met ieders geobserveerde doen en laten in de praktijk.

Uit het onderzoek blijkt dat de nieuwe strategie veel pluspunten meebrengt, zoals een effectievere samenwerking en betere werkflow. Door de wekelijkse vergaderingen komen bijzonderheden sneller aan het licht en worden eventuele problemen al vroegtijdig gesignaleerd en opgelost. Daarnaast zijn managers beter op de hoogte van de campagnes die op de planning staan, wat een beter beeld geeft van de (toekomstige) werkdruk. Dit komt de prestaties van de werknemers ten goede.

Helaas kent de nieuwe samenwerking ook zijn gebreken. De rode lijn die hierin naar voren komt, is het gemis van een duidelijke structuur voor de vergaderingen, het gebrek aan goede voorkennis bij de deelnemers en de gebrekkige verdeling van informatie. De simpele, maar effectieve oplossing hiervoor lijkt één centraal informatiepunt: een dashboard met to do’s en statusupdates van alle campagnes. Door gedurende de week dit bord bij te werken, is iedereen altijd voorbereid en op de hoogte van de laatste informatie, zodat tijdens de meetings daadwerkelijk gefocust kan worden op de inhoud.

Wanneer dit advies in acht wordt genomen, kan er over een aantal maanden een vervolgonderzoek worden uitgevoerd naar de effectiviteit van de samenwerking. Dit zal niet alleen leiden tot nieuwe inzichten voor XXXXX zelf, maar zal ook een waardevolle bijdrage leveren aan het huidige wetenschappelijke debat over interne communicatie."

Deze en meer verschillen worden in dit onderzoek aan de hand van theoretische ontwikkelingen op het gebied van werkvormen geïnventariseerd. Daarnaast worden respondenten gevraagd hun reflecties te geven op de eerdergenoemde democratische waarden. Vervolgens kijkt het onderzoek naar mogelijke dwarsverbanden tussen deze reacties. Als laatste stap kijkt het onderzoek met een inductieve, theoriebouwende blik naar alle zaken die op de achtergrond van de werkvormen afspelen. Wat zijn randvoorwaarden, waar moeten bestuurders (op de werkvorm na) hun aandacht aan schenken als ze democratische waarden willen helpen verwezenlijken? Dit alles vindt plaats in de context van de energietransitie in één van de regio’s van het Nationale Programma Regionale Energie Strategie, ontstaan uit het Klimaatakkoord. De resultaten van het onderzoek geven rijke beschrijvingen van de context, toegepaste werkvormen en hun implementatie in één van de modellen, alsmede een beschouwing van alle zaken die ofwel indirect via de werkvormen ofwel direct gevolgen hebben op de verwezenlijking van democratische waarden.

Dit 
geldt ook voor de onderwijssector. Schoolleiders kwamen door de coronacrisis in een situatie die voor 
hen nieuw was. De crisis, die inmiddels is bestempeld als creeping crisis (Boin et al., 2021), had een 
andere vorm dan schoolleiders waren gewend. Een creeping crisis heeft een langzame opbouw, 
waarna het tot een kritiek punt komt. Na dit kritieke punt zal het nog voor lange tijd door blijven gaan 
maar nog steeds om de zoveel tijd opkomende piekpunten hebben, wat maakt dat de crisis een 
ambigue aard heeft (Boin et al., 2021). Schoolleiders zijn vooral bekend met het beteugelen van korte 
crises (Whitla, 2003; School en Veiligheid, 2021), welke niet dezelfde aard hebben als een creeping 
crisis. Er bleek bovendien nog nauwelijks onderzoek te zijn gedaan naar creeping crisis in het 
algemeen (Boin et al., 2020) en helemaal geen onderzoek naar creeping crises in de onderwijssector. 
Er was dus een theoretisch gat op het punt van creeping crises in de onderwijssector. Dit 
scriptieonderzoek vult dit theoretische gat voor een klein deel op door een antwoord te geven op de 
vraag hoe schoolleiders de coronacrisis als creeping crisis hebben beteugeld. 

In dit onderzoek is er gebruik gemaakt van twee verschillende deelonderzoeken. Waarbij in 
deelonderzoek één 11 schoolleiders zijn geïnterviewd en hierbij aan de hand van een vooropgestelde 
tijdlijn is gevraagd naar hun handelingen gedurende de periode van 15 maart 2020 tot 14 december 
2020. Daarnaast is er een tweede deelonderzoek gedaan, waarbij aan de hand van een inhoudsanalyse 
verschillende krantenartikelen uit de periode van 1 maart 2020 tot 1 januari 2021 geselecteerd zijn en 
5 interviews uit het Schoolleidersregister Voortgezet Onderwijs (SRVO) geselecteerd zijn als 
toevoeging aan de onderzochte data van dit onderzoek. De data zijn geanalyseerd aan de hand van een 
op basis van het theoretisch kader vooropgestelde codeboom. 

Uit de resultaten blijkt dat schoolleiders de creeping crisis hebben getracht te beteugelen door in eerste 
instantie gebruik te maken van interventies uit het korte crisis crisismanagement. Dit was namelijk een 
vorm van crisismanagement dat voor hen bekend terrein was. In de beginperiode van de crisis betrof 
dit het gebruik maken van materiële en informatieve bronnen die al in de organisatie voorhanden 
waren, het handelen op een snelle en directieve manier, het verzorgen van veel interactieve momenten
met het docententeam en het communiceren op een zendende (met weinig vorm van interactie) manier 
met ouders en leerlingen.
In de periode die hierop volgde, vlak voor de zomervakantie van 2020, kwam er in het 
crisismanagement juist een stevige focus op de interactie tussen de schoolleiding en ouders en 
leerlingen. Op deze manier werd het gevoerde beleid geëvalueerd en werd een goede vorm gevonden 
voor het te voeren beleid na de zomervakantie.
In de laatste periode, die volgde na de zomervakantie tot het eind van de scope van dit onderzoek (14 
december 2020), is te zien dat schoolleiders zich niet langer meer vast konden houden aan het handelen naar facetten van korte crisis crisismanagement. In deze periode brachten schoolleiders de 
algehele frequentie van de communicatie omlaag en focusten zij zich op een kleine groep ouders en 
leerlingen die het niet eens was met de gevoerde interventies om de besmettingen tegen te gaan. De 
focus van schoolleiders op deze groep in combinatie met de lange duur en de ambigue aard van de 
crisis zorgde voor een geringer draagvlak voor de door te voeren interventies bij de meerderheid van 
het personeel, de ouders en de leerlingen. Uit het onderzoek komt enigszins naar voren dat de scholen 
die een langetermijnvisie, los van de crisis hadden, op meer draagvlak onder personeel, ouders en 
leerlingen konden bogen"

In dit onderzoek heb ik mij verdiept in de organisatiestructuur ‘soft franchise’ en specifiek ben ik ingegaan op de uitdaging die er ligt: de balans zoeken tussen autonomie en afhankelijkheid. Ik heb dit bij de non profitorganisatie Stichting Present onderzocht aan de hand van deze onderzoeksvraag: ‘Hoe ervaren coördinatoren, directeuren en bestuursleden van lokale stichtingen van Present autonomie binnen de soft franchisestructuur?’. Door middel van interviews met 16 coördinatoren, directeuren en bestuursleden van verschillende lokale stichtingen heb ik drie inzichten gepresenteerd: de kenmerken van een lokale stichting, de soft franchise als uitdaging en de non-profit als uitdaging. Deze inzichten verduidelijken dat het concept autonomie op een complexe manier verweven is met een non-profitorganisatie en een soft franchisestructuur. Autonomie kan namelijk tegelijkertijd in een hogere mate als in een lagere mate ervaren worden doordat autonomie ervaren kan worden ten opzichte van verschillende thema’s en entiteiten. Een non-profitorganisatie met een soft franchisestructuur kan hier haar voordeel mee doen door de nadruk te leggen op hoe de franchisegever een faciliterende rol kan invullen en hoe de franchisenemer lokaal in haar kracht gezet kan worden."

Een weg naar groen asfalt. Een deductief explorerend kwalitatief onderzoek naar het managen van de triple bottom line binnen de asfaltsector","['Leeuwen, Femke van']","['Loyens, K.M.']",2022-03-15T00:01:00Z,NL,['triple bottom line; sustainable procurement; asfaltsector'],"Organisaties, verandering en management","De Nederlandse overheid heeft als doel gesteld dat in 2050 de uitstoot van nationale broeikasgassen met 95% is teruggedrongen. Om deze klimaatdoelstelling te halen is van belang dat binnen de asfaltsector innovaties plaatsvinden die bijdragen aan het duurzamer produceren en aanleggen van asfalt. De overheid speelt een belangrijke rol in het verduurzamen van de asfaltsector, omdat zij via sustainable procurement marktpartijen kan stimuleren duurzamer te werken. Sustainable procurement is erg complex en vormt een grote uitdaging voor managers binnen de overheid die ervoor verantwoordelijk zijn. Dit komt omdat er rekening moet worden gehouden met verschillende dimensies, namelijk de economische dimensie, de sociale dimensie en de duurzame dimensie. Deze drie dimensies vormen de triple bottom line. In de wetenschappelijke literatuur is nog weinig bekend over hoe individuen het managen van de triple bottom line ervaren. Dit onderzoek gaat in op deze individuele ervaring bij gemeentelijke opdrachtgevers van asfalteringsprojecten, en heeft de volgende hoofdvraag: hoe ervaren opdrachtgevers binnen de asfaltsector het managen van de triple bottom line die ten grondslag ligt aan sustainable procurement door de overheid?
De hoofdvraag wordt beantwoord door gebruik te maken van kwalitatief deductief explorerend onderzoek. Om empirische data te verzamelen wordt gebruik gemaakt van een case study, die bestaat uit het aanbestedingsproces van asfalteringsprojecten door Nederlandse gemeenten. Binnen deze case study zijn tien semigestructureerde interviews met gemeentelijke opdrachtgevers van asfaltaanbestedingen gehouden.
Uit de interviews komt naar voren dat de onderlinge verhouding tussen de drie dimensies van de triple bottom line op twee manieren wordt ervaren. Enerzijds als ongelijkwaardig, waarbij de economische dimensie altijd de overhand krijgt. Anderzijds als paradoxaal en dus gelijkwaardig aan elkaar. Hoe de dimensies worden ervaren is afhankelijk van of er op korte termijn beslissingen moeten worden gemaakt (dimensies ongelijkwaardig) of dat er de mogelijkheid is om keuzes voor de lange termijn te maken (dimensies paradoxaal). Het managen van de paradoxale triple bottom line wordt ervaren als een proces dat om constante aandacht vraagt, waarbij keuzes via splitten en synthese worden gemaakt. Bij het managen van de triple bottom line-paradox ontstaan spanningen op het gebied van beloning, organizing, performing en learning. Wat verder uit de resultaten naar voren komt is dat de drie dimensies van de triple bottom line niet als drie losse entiteiten worden gezien. De resultaten tonen aan dat de sociale en duurzame dimensie als één entiteit worden ervaren. Dit betekent dus dat de economische dimensie als conflicterend wordt ervaren met de andere dimensies, maar dat de sociale en duurzame dimensie niet als onderling conflicterend worden ervaren.
Concluderend luidt het antwoord op de hoofdvraag dus als volgt: opdrachtgevers binnen de asfaltsector ervaren bij het managen van de triple bottom line zowel paradoxale als ongelijke dimensies, afhankelijk van of ze druk ervaren om op korte termijn keuzes te maken. Het op lange termijn managen van de drie dimensies vraagt om constante aandacht en levert paradoxale spanningen op het gebied van beloning, organizing, performing en learning.
Vervolgonderzoek zou respondenten uit andere overheidsinstanties, zoals provincies of Rijkswaterstaat, kunnen meenemen om zo meer relevante data over het managen van de triple bottom line bij asfaltaanbestedingen te verzamelen. Daarnaast kan onderzoek binnen andere aanbestedingssectoren, zoals aanbestedingen binnen de bouw of onderhoud, meer inzicht bieden in hoe individuen binnen overheidsinstanties het managen van de triple bottom line bij aanbestedingen ervaren. Verder zouden toekomstige onderzoekers inductief onderzoek kunnen toepassen om relevante bevindingen"

Het is daarom van belang om inzicht te krijgen in welke factoren invloed uitoefenen op de deelname van gemeenteambtenaren aan formele en informele leer- en ontwikkelactiviteiten. In dit onderzoek is er gepoogd deze factoren in kaart te brengen aan de hand van het AMO-model.

Deze onderzoeksvraag is beantwoord aan de hand van semigestructureerde interviews. Er zijn twintig gemeenteambtenaren geïnterviewd binnen één gemeentelijke organisatie en er is aldus gebruik gemaakt van een case-study. Uit de resultaten uit dit onderzoek kan worden geconcludeerd dat als gemeenteambtenaren beschikken over de benodigde capaciteit (kennis en persoonlijk vermogen), een autonome vorm van motivatie en fysieke en sociale mogelijkheden dit een stimulerende invloed heeft op hun deelname aan formele en informele leer- en ontwikkelactiviteiten."
Making Groups Work: Identifying Group Work Problems via Peer Assessment in Higher Education,"['Veth, Danny']","['Masthoff, J.F.M.']",2022-03-15T00:00:39Z,EN,['Problem Identification;Group Work;Qualitative Research;Human-computer Interaction;Peer Assessment;'],Human-Computer Interaction,"In higher education, teamwork and collaboration are often part of the core educational experience. Yet, many students have negative associations or attitudes towards group projects. Problems such as social loafing and poor communication are very common when working in a group, but unfortunately teachers do not have enough time to monitor each group extensively. The goal of this research is to find a method that can identify group work problems as soon as possible via computer-supported assessment. Three qualitative research methods were used to reach this goal. First, seven interviews were held in order to get a clear view of the research context. The data of the interviews was triangulated with the literature review and valuable data was obtained for preliminary assessment design. Next, six basic visualizations and 15 advanced visualizations were sketched for assessing group issues. These were ranked in two focus groups according to motivational ability, preference, and suitability for five group work attributes: Quality of Cooperation, Quality of Contribution, Productivity, Reliability, and Friendliness. The top-ranked basic- and advanced visualizations were used to create two versions of a peer assessment survey. Students from a bachelor-level course were invited to submit two peer assessments throughout the course of their group projects. After the deadline of the project had passed, the students were invited to provide feedback on the peer assessment. The feedback survey showed that most participants had a positive experience with the peer assessment survey. No real differences were found between the basic- and advanced visualization versions of the survey in terms of effectiveness or reliability. Besides the students, all members of the teaching staff were very positive towards the peer assessment method. Therefore it can be concluded that the assessment method as described in this research has the potential to be useful for problem identification in group work in higher education."

"Impacts of Mangrove Dieback and Recovery on Coastal Wetland: A Case Study in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia.","['Dzimballa, Sarah']","['Kleinhans, Maarten']",2022-03-11T00:00:32Z,EN,['mangroves; sea-level drop; bio-morphodynamic feedbacks; dieback and recovery; numerical modelling'],Marine Sciences,"Mangrove forests are valuable ecosystems, offering socioeconomic and ecological services and thereby supporting the livelihood of millions of people. However, man- grove areas are declining due to various threats. These include coastal development, increasing extreme weather events (e.g. droughts and cyclones) and sea level rise. One recent example of a mass mangrove area loss is the dieback event in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Queensland Australia. With the loss of the mangrove trees, their valuable ecosystem services such as coastal protection and carbon sequestration are lost. Therefore, a need to further understand these valuable ecosystems and their morpho- and hydrodynamic interactions becomes apparent. In order to mitigate such dieback events and identify recovery projections.
The aim of this study is to gain insights into the causes of the dieback event and project the possible recovery of the mangrove characteristics within an estuary, by conducting numerical simulations with a biomorphodynamic model. Thereby, the hydromorphodynamic model, Delft3D is coupled to a dynamic mangrove vegetation model. The model was used to simulate the development of mangrove trees within an estuary, de- pendent on inundation and competition. Thereby the effects of tides, river discharge and sediment availability are included. The model input parameter and boundary conditions were chosen to resemble the case study of the Leichhardt estuary in the Gulf of Carpentaria. In five phases, the estuary development, mangrove establishment (with and without fluvial mud supply), mangrove dieback due to sea level drop and river discharge decrease and mangrove recovery were modelled.
The results indicate that, during the mangrove colonization, the inclusion of fluvial mud supply lead to lower mangrove area coverage in the estuary. This was found to originate from sedimentation and mud accumulation on bars, elevating the bed to a level that no inundation can reach these areas. Therefore, not enough water is avail- able in those areas for mangrove growth. During the mangrove dieback simulation, the results further show that mangrove dieback can be provoked within the model by a sea level drop and river discharge decrease. Thus, the hypothesis of sea level drop and drought conditions causing the large-scale dieback was validated within the model. But at the same time some differences in dieback pattern suggest that further factors could have potentially played a role in the dieback in certain areas. The mangrove dieback has effects on the morphology and hydrodynamics of the estuary. The absence of mangrove vegetation leads to an increased flow velocity in the area of mangrove loss and decreased flow velocity in the channels and thereby, channel infilling, channel shifting, and decreased sedimentation in the previously vegetated areas. This was found to be based on the reduced flow resistance in the dieback areas. While this leads to a decrease in flow velocities in the channels causing the channel infilling. Channel shifting is on the one hand caused by reduced vegetation bank stabilization and vertical velocity increase due to the vegetation cover. During the simulation of the recovery it was found, that these hydromorphodynamic changes due to the decreased mangrove cover have effects on the mangrove recovery, leading to a hysteresis effect. The mangrove area dieback leads to morphological and hydrodynamic change within the estuary which in turn has a negative effect in the re- settlement of mangroves in the dieback area. For the natural system, it was therefore concluded that considering the likelihood of further disturbance events (e.g., sea level rise, droughts, cyclones) during the recovery process a full recovery seems unlikely."

With the effects of climate change and a growing number of mouths to feed, urban rooftop farming initiatives have emerged as an interesting solution to solving the myriad of challenges facing cities. The production of food on rooftops has been linked to a wide range of sustainability aspects as it can contribute to improving food security, heat island effect mitigation, biodiversity increase, job creation, storm water management and social cohesion. Rooftop farm initiatives have been gaining momentum over the past decades. A growing body of literature has been developed, reviewing the current trends, sustainability aspects and performance of rooftop farms compared to that of conventional production. 

However, to achieve the full sustainability potential of urban rooftop farms, understanding the critical aspects that contribute to their impact considering the environmental, economic, and social perspectives is essential. This research focuses on understanding the classification of different types of rooftop farming initiatives by compiling ongoing urban rooftop farms (URFs) worldwide. A review of the current literature on the different sustainability aspects of rooftop agriculture is then conducted. Moreover, the study analyzes the environmental and economic performance of URFs by examining the life cycle assessment and costings to determine the key benefits, impacts and areas of improvement. The sustainability assessment then formed the basis for recommendations on the design of sustainable URFs. Results show that the typology, farming methods and function of URFs can vary widely in turn influencing their sustainability impact. At present, the metrics being used to evaluate the performance of URF do not evaluate the full range of sustainability benefits. Future research should focus on developing new metrics to provide a complete picture of the sustainability impact of rooftop farms."
Safe Sports: a qualitative research on the education on anti-social behaviour in the Dutch Sports context,"['Lauritsen, Danique']","['Rahmouni Elidrissi, Yousra']",2022-03-15T00:00:36Z,EN,['Sports Context; Safe Sports Climate; Anti-Social Behaviour; Educational Programs and Training; Education on Integrity; Ethical Environment'],"Organisaties, verandering en management","Sports is often promoted for its positive impact on people’s physical health, the benefits for
mental well-being, and its value to society. Yet, there is also a negative side to sports. In this
qualitative-interpretive research, I explore this negative side of sports, which is characterised
by integrity violations such as match fixing, doping, and anti-social behaviour, and I aim to
examine how educational programs of NOC*NSF prevent integrity violations from happening.
This study provides an analysis of how educational programs provided by NOC*NSF on antisocial behaviour contribute to a safe sports climate in the Dutch context. Through interviews,
participants observation, and document analysis, the views on anti-social behaviour have been
examined, the educational programs have been investigated, and the perceptions of participants
on educational programs have been studied. The findings show that the educational programs
of NOC*NSF contribute, to a limited extent, to a safe sports climate by raising awareness to 
create a sense of responsibility for safe sports in non-athlete actors and by providing them with 
tools and measures to address anti-social behaviour. However, the analysis also illustrates that
the contribution to a safe sports climate is limited as anti-social behaviour is defined as
ambiguous and subjective, confusing both educational trainers and participants. Above that, the
educational programs miss profundity. There is a need from participants for more dialogue,
assignments, and cases in which the issue of anti-social behaviour is discussed. Yet, in their
educational programs, NOC*NSF avoids sensitive topics, and the underlying values, social
norms, and cultural beliefs that form the antecedents of anti-social behaviour are not addressed.
As a result, participants do not get enough preventive tools to tackle the causes of anti-social
behaviour, which has a detrimental effect on the creation and maintenance of a safe sports
climate."

By analysing the artistic work of Rafaele Andrade, BUI, and Tactology Lab, I illustrate how material relations between the instrument and the performer's body, and between site and performer can be approached differently. This raises questions about how music can and ought to be curated. I aim to answer the research question: what are the curatorial implications of a changing material relationality in music performance? Drawing from relational ontology, as introduced by Karen Barad, and the insights it provided to musicology, I question the taken-for-granted dichotomies between the performer and instrument, and performer and performance site. Through the notion of somatechnics I provide an understanding of the mutual affective relationship between the performer's body and the instrument. By engaging with discourses on site-specific art and the concept of becoming-with, I introduce the notion of becoming-with-site to stress the site as an active force in site-specific music performance. At last, through theorizing curating as reality making itself, I propose to turn away from individualized and logocentric curatorial approaches. By using diffraction as a methodology I can take into account both the interdisciplinary aspects of the works discussed and my position as a researcher in relation to the research object. The analysis provides an understanding of how material relationality in music performance can impact curatorial practices. Being attentive to the way how the bodies of performers are implicated with instruments opens up new possibilities for a reality-making curatorial strategy. Through the notion of becoming-with-site it’s illustrated how performances are not only referring to reality through narratives but become part of reality itself. Lastly, I argue that structuring a curatorial project as an educational project can be a way to address the material relationality in music performance."

Organisatiesocialisatie in studentensportverenigingn. Een onderzoek naar de bewuste en onbewuste inzet van socialisatietactieken binnen studentensportverenigingen.,"['Grootens, Saskia']","['Slobbe, Michel van']",2022-03-15T00:00:53Z,NL,"['organisatiesocialisatie, socialisatie, socialisatietactieken, studentensport, studentensportverenigingen, R. Stokvis,']",Sportbeleid en sportmanagement,"In de organisatiekunde wordt al langer gesproken over het belang van het socialiseren van nieuwkomers in een organisatie. Onder socialisatie wordt het proces verstaan waarbij nieuwkomers de kennis en vaardigheden opdoen en de normen en cultuur van het sociale systeem leren begrijpen zodat zij effectief kunnen participeren in de organisatie (Van Maanen & Schein, 1979; Jones, 1986). In 2011 formuleert Ruud Stokvis in een unpublished manuscript zijn theorie over de centrale processen die het voortbestaan van de sportclub bepalen. Een succesvol socialisatieproces maakt hier onderdeel vanuit. Hij verwijst daarbij naar het stabiele karakter van de studentensportvereniging (ssv), en de mate waarin dit type sportclub erin slaagt om continuïteit te bieden aan leden het voortbestaan van de club te waarborgen. Een hoog verloop aan leden en snelle wisselingen van het (bestuurlijk) kader suggereren dat ssv’s bewust invulling geven aan socialisatieprocessen. De onderzoeksvraag die op basis daarvan gesteld wordt binnen deze studie luidt dan ook: welke tactieken worden door de bestuurders van studentensportverenigingen in Utrecht ingezet ten behoeve van het socialisatieproces van nieuwe leden, en wat zijn de werkzame elementen van deze socialisatietactieken?

Door de inzet van specifiek vijf socialisatietactieken structureren de ssv’s hun socialisatie- inspanningen en weten ze continuïteit voor hun leden te bewerkstelligen. Opvallend is echter dat bestuurders zich lang niet altijd bewust zijn van de gekozen tactieken, en dat tactieken eveneens onbewust worden geselecteerd door de studentbestuurders.

Groepservaringen als basis voor het verenigingsleven
Veruit de meest genoemde socialisatietactiek betreft het organiseren van sociale evenementen ten behoeve van het creëren van sociale verbondenheid in de eerste maanden van het lidmaatschap. Het belang van commissiewerk is daarbij groot, omdat dergelijke groepen niet draaien om het werk dat verricht wordt, maar juist door de sociale verbintenissen die dit teweegbrengt.

Een belangrijke rol voor veteranen
Ouderejaarsleden, ook wel ‘veteranen’ genoemd, spelen een belangrijke rol binnen de socialisatieprocessen bij studentensportverenigingen. Ze voorzien nieuwe leden van informatie over de vereniging, brengen nieuwe leden in contact met anderen en promoten deelname aan (sociale) activiteiten en commissies. In veel opzichten fungeren ouderejaarsleden ook binnen de sportvereniging als geheel als verlengstuk van de bestuurder.

Formele en informele leerervaringen
De ssv’s maken daarnaast gebruik van een combinatie aan formele en informele socialisatietactieken. Kennis over de vereniging kan worden opgedaan door middel van introductiedagen waarbij verplicht vrijwilligerswerk wordt toegelicht, maar ook informele uitwisselingen met veteranen vormen een manier om kennis over te brengen.

Planvorming en de kracht van standaardisatie
Opvallend is dat studentensportverenigingen jaarlijks vrijwel dezelfde activiteitenkalender herhalen en daarmee jaarlijks vrijwel dezelfde socialisatietactieken inzetten ten behoeve van de socialisatie van nieuwe leden.
Feedback ter bevordering van het socialisatieproces

De vijfde socialisatietactiek betreft het met enige regelmaat vragen naar feedback en input vanuit leden. Het maakt dat de plannen jaarlijkse geoptimaliseerd raken, en draagt bij aan het democratische gehalte van de vereniging.

De werkzame elementen die binnen deze socialisatietactieken naar voren komen hebben allemaal te maken met de rol van de bestuurder binnen de studentensportvereniging. Met name de mate waarin bestuurders zichzelf als veteranen inzetten en eerstejaarsleden bij de hand nemen, en de mate waarin zij verantwoordelijk zijn voor de (verschillende vormen van) communicatie maken dat de socialisatietactieken succesvol kunnen worden ingezet."
Remote leadership in de post-COVID hybride organisatie,"['Sprokkereef, Daniël']","['Loyens, K.M.']",2022-03-15T00:00:46Z,NL,[],"Organisaties, verandering en management","De COVID-19 pandemie heeft de manier waarop organisaties functioneren en ingericht zijn, blijvend veranderd. Thuiswerken is immers voor veel organisaties vrijwel volledig de norm geworden. Deze gedwongen transitie blijkt echter grote voordelen met zich mee te brengen: onder andere een verminderde reistijd, een hogere controle over het verrichte werk en een betere werk-privé balans behoren tot de voordelen.  Nu een wereld post-COVID-19 pandemie steeds realistischer wordt, is het voornemen ontstaan de positieve kanten die verbonden blijken te zijn aan zowel het thuiswerken, als aan de traditionele manier van werken op kantoor, in een hybride werkvorm te verenigen. Deze hybride organisaties worden geconfronteerd met een aantal nieuwe vraagstukken, waarin een cruciale rol lijkt weggelegd voor remote leadership: leidinggeven op afstand. Het Politiedienstencentrum van de Nationale Politie is een organisatie waarin dit voornemen rondom het creëren van een hybride organisatie een zeer actuele is. 
Het doel van dit onderzoek is aldus een antwoord te formuleren op de volgende hoofdvraag: ‘Hoe geven de hogere leidinggevenden binnen het Politiedienstencentrum van de Nationale Politie betekenis aan remote leadership in de toekomstige hybride organisatie?’. Deze hoofdvraag is opgedeeld in drie deelvragen: 1) Hoe ervaren de leidinggevenden hun huidige manier van leidinggeven op afstand (remote leadership)?, 2) Wat verstaan de leidinggevenden onder de toekomstige hybride organisatie?, 3) Welke rol dichten de leidinggevenden aan remote leadership in de toekomstige hybride organisatie toe?. 
	Het antwoord op de hoofdvraag en deelvragen is op basis van een kwalitatief onderzoek in de vorm van een casestudy geformuleerd. Binnen de casestudy zijn 15 leidinggevenden op verschillende hoge leidinggevende niveaus binnen het Politiedienstencentrum geïnterviewd. De gemene deler tussen deze hogere leidinggevenden was dat zij allen op strategisch en tactisch niveau aan het Politiedienstencentrum verbonden zijn. De interviews zijn semigestructureerd afgenomen en samen met enkele documenten over leiderschap binnen het Politiedienstencentrum, geanalyseerd. 
	Op basis van deze analyse zijn de belangrijkste resultaten van dit onderzoek als volgt te duiden. Binnen de context van een hybride organisatie is het van belang remote leadership vorm te geven vanuit een outputgerichte oriëntatie, waarbij er oog is voor individuele verschillen in thuissituaties, er actief geïnvesteerd moet worden in de onderlinge verbinding tussen werknemers, en een faciliterende rol wat betreft fysieke ontmoetingen door de leidinggevende moet worden aangenomen. Tevens moet er in een visie vanuit de organisatie expliciet gemaakt worden in hoeverre de vrijheid van medewerkers om autonoom te bepalen of er thuis of op kantoor gewerkt wordt, vergroot of verkleind wordt. 
	Dit onderzoek vertegenwoordigt hierin wetenschappelijke waarde door het aandragen van enkele kritische opmerkingen en vragen omtrent de bestaande literatuur. Hierbij worden suggesties voor toevoegingen of nuanceringen gedaan. De praktische implicaties van dit onderzoek schuilen daarbij in de bewustwording van de mogelijk verschuivende rol van een leidinggevende die gepaard gaat met de nieuwe organisatiecontext die de hybride organisatie in de toekomst gaat zijn. Dit onderzoek doet daarbij tevens enkele suggesties voor vervolgonderzoek."

The cortical actin cytoskeleton has been suggested to be strongly associated with membrane diffusion, as it has been shown to induce membrane compartmentalisation. However, previous studies have investigated its effect on membrane diffusion on only a limited range of membrane molecules. Therefore, this study has aimed to elucidate the role of the cortical actin cytoskeleton on the diffusion of inner leaflet-anchored proteins, transmembrane proteins and GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) in the plasma membrane. Using confocal imaging and FCS, the membrane organisation and diffusion of these membrane proteins were measured in live cells treated with the cytoskeleton disrupting drugs CK666 and Cytochalasin D (CytD), and in actin cytoskeleton-free giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs). These measurements have found the actin cytoskeleton to play a confining role in the diffusion of the three classes of proteins measured, as diffusion was much faster in the cell-derived GPMVs than in live cells. In live cells treated with CK666 and CytD, this effect was shown to be largest for inner leaflet-anchored proteins. Additionally, diffusion was shown to be slower and more affected by cytoskeleton disrupting drugs in CHO cells than in U2OS cells. This strongly suggests there to be cell-specific effects of the cortical actin cytoskeleton on membrane diffusion. The results presented in this study thereby highlight the importance and complexity of the cortical actin cytoskeletal mechanisms of modulating membrane protein diffusion."

Methods. Studies were selected from 2 sources: the DiMe Library of Digital Endpoints and
literature indexed in PubMed. Studies in DiMe Library in which product type was indicated as
“drug” or “biologic” were included. A search query was developed, and the resulting articles
were screened by their titles, abstracts, and text according to the inclusion criteria. Data

connected sensor technologies to support secondary endpoints (56.3%). The most commonly
addressed disease group was diseases of the nervous system (19.7%), followed by diseases of
the respiratory system (18.3%), endocrine diseases (14.1%), and diseases of the circulatory
system (12.8%). Most of the indicated conditions required long-term disease management.
Conclusion. The use of connected sensor technologies in clinical trials was already an ongoing
process for a long time. We conclude that multiple factors are contributing to increasing
interest. Major factors are increased regulatory guidance and acceptance and acceleration by
the COVID-19 pandemic. In the coming years, a growing interest is expected in digital measures
that offer objective measurement of established endpoints, increasing the knowledge and
regulatory maturity in the domain. Once the quality standards and acceptance by all the
industry stakeholders are established, a steep increase in innovative digital endpoints may be
observed."

This made it more difficult for veterinary nurses to identify and analyze the pain levels of dogs on a daily basis. To assist veterinary nurses in recognizing dogs' discomfort behavior, an automated surveillance system is sought. The basic aim of the pain recognition system is to use appropriate expression to portray dog behavior, integrate sufficient data with dogs' motion patterns in pain stages, and make accurate judgment.

In this study, we present a deep learning-based model for distinguishing between pain and non-pain in dog video recordings. This model features a two-stream design that enables the spatial-temporal information contained in RGB video frames to be combined with the sequence of corresponding keypoints. To extract posture information from video frames, we develop a hierarchical technique for extracting dog's body keypoints and compare its performance to that of other backbone pose estimation systems. We also present a unique video-based dog pain dataset with the assistance of veterinary professionals. On this dataset, we try different variants of our model, demonstrating the importance of the two-stream structure and the practicality of different model fusion strategies. While there has been no prior study utilizing machine learning algorithms to recognize dog pain. We compare our model to a state-of-the-art video-based approach for recognizing animal pain. Our model outperformed others in terms of prediction accuracy on the dog pain recognition task."
"The Understanding of Ambiguity as a
Design Resource: Suggesting concrete design tactics for creating ambiguous design and testing its
effects on users’ reflection, user engagement and system usability.","['Herbes, Pia']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-03-16T00:00:43Z,EN,['ambiguity; design tactics; reflection; user engagement; design research'],Human-Computer Interaction,"Researchers have only recently started seeing ambiguity as something positive in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). When used in the right way, ambiguous design can create more engagement or provoke thoughts in the user. Currently there is a gap in research between the understanding of ambiguity in theory and its applied practice. In this research we undertake this gap with a systematic review on current research in ambiguous design. Via this review we answered the question: how is the concept of ambiguity understood and used as a design resource in the field of HCI?
Papers for the analysis were retrieved from ACM and selected using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). The final corpus of our review consists of fifty-five papers. We analyzed these papers with open coding using the software Atlas.ti. Of our corpus, in nine papers ambiguity was discussed and in forty-five papers ambiguity was applied in practice.
The review shows that ambiguity can be used in design, as well as in methods for creating design. Additionally, we show different goals and effects on users that can be achieved with ambiguous design, such as curiosity, social engagement,  play, immersion, awareness, understanding, reflection, and creativity. We also found that balance is an important subject in creating ambiguous design, as too ambiguous design can create confusion in users, while design that is not ambiguous enough might not evoke the preferred effects. Yet, creating this balance is not an easy task, as it is difficult to know in advance how ambiguity will be perceived. Additionally, we discuss the different types of ambiguity and design tactics that are suggest in the papers. The suggested design tactics appeared to be abstract, and were not mentioned in the majority of the papers in our corpus. To make design tactics easier to use in practice, we created more concrete design tactics based on ambiguous designs that were presented in our corpus. In total, we present ten concrete design along with examples of ambiguous designs that apply these tactics: absence of purpose, absence of obvious connection, absence of information, absence of object, connection of external situations, abstract representation, data physicalization, ambiguous data, and uncomfortable design. 
To test the findings in our literature review, we created a prototype that included different concrete design tactics. These were tested in four ways, with four conditions: Condition A did not include the design tactics, condition B included the absence of information, condition C included the absence of (original) context, and condition D included a combination of absence of obvious connection and abstract presentation. In all conditions, participants filled in a questionnaire that included questions regarding the user's reflection, user engagement, system usability and perceived creepiness of the design. Additionally, participants were invited to an interview to get insights on additional thought processes. In total 82 participants were recruited. Although no significance was found, the results indicate a more diverse opinion about the system's usability and the perceived creepiness of the device in ambiguous conditions, and interestingly an indication of lower user engagement in the ambiguous conditions. The qualitative results also resembled a variety of opinions, as participants either found the device confusing, experienced a learning curve, or thought it was easy to use. Interestingly, the majority of the participants were positive about the interaction with the device, even when they found it confusing. In future research this instance can be further studied. Other suggestions for future research are to study the right balance of ambiguityand and and create a standardized way to analyze the ambiguity of a design."
Analysing Living Labs as enablers of sustainability transitions: could regenerative development nurture their impact?,"['Pastorelli, Nichi']","['Appelman, Jaco']",2022-03-16T00:00:44Z,EN,['sustainable development goals; SDGs; sustainability; sustainability transitions; living labs; regenerative development;'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Humanity is not on track to achieve either the human or the environmental dimension of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and sustainability transitions, radical transformations towards a sustainable society, seem to be extremely necessary. Systemic integrated approaches such as Living Labs (LLs), the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and regenerative development (RD) are currently getting considerable attention as potential strategies enabling global sustainability transitions and each one might hold the potential to better inform the others to enable greater sustainable impact. This review aims at engaging conversations around such potential. Recent literature on the contribution of LLs within sustainability transitions is analysed, using the UN SDGs as the benchmark to define such contributions. Overall, all LLs analysed in this article contribute to SDG target 11.4 which concerns strengthening “efforts to protect and safeguard the world’s cultural and natural heritage” and out of 169 SDGs targets, 46 were found to be addressed directly by LLs agendas. Despite LLs action acknowledging the interconnectedness of sustainability issues, some subjects proved to be more common than others within LLs projects. RD is defined and characterised, according to recent literature, and it is discussed whether aspects of this approach could prove to be useful to inform LLs contribution to meeting the SDGs and sustainability transitions. Interestingly, RD and LLs seem to share many common elements and such results may prove the compatibility of the two approaches to positively inform one another. LLs and RD are addressing the same challenge of redesigning the human impact on the planet, and RD takes the challenge to a deeper level: changing the impact of humanity on the planet cannot happen without also redesigning the presence of humanity on the planet. Perhaps, RD may prove to be helpful to LLs by providing insights on (how to) asking the right questions, making sure that LLs are also addressing symptoms, and not only causes, of unsustainable development whilst LLs may provide RD with the ideal physical environment in which put into practice its concepts."
"Alternative Splicing, a Driving Force in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia and How to Target it","['Smink, Job']","['Heidenreich, Olaf']",2022-03-16T00:00:49Z,EN,['Splicing; alternative splicing; acute myeloid leukaemia'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"A cell contains a genetic code called DNA that stores all the biological information. To produce proteins from DNA messenger RNA (mRNA) is needed. Initially, mRNA is transcribed as a primary transcript called pre-mRNA, which has multiple coding regions separated by non-coding regions. In order to translate a protein from pre-mRNA, the non-coding regions have to be spliced out first. Splicing is performed by a complex of different proteins called the spliceosome, which consists of a few core proteins and splicing factors. After additional RNA processing, the mRNA is ready for translation into a protein.
The human genome comprises roughly 20.000 to 25.000 protein-coding genes, however, together they encode over 90.000 different proteins. The diversity is caused by a process called alternative splicing (AS), where the non-coding and coding regions are spliced differently. This entitles that either coding regions are alternatively included/excluded or non-coding regions are retained, resulting in a mRNA isoform. These isoforms are then translated into different versions of the same protein (protein isoforms). Aberration in AS is often involved and critical for different cancers, such as acute myeloid leukaemia. This is a malignant disorder of the myeloid line of blood cells and is characterized by rapid expansion of abnormal blood cells and interferes with normal blood cell production. It is the most prevalent form of acute leukaemia, with around 20.000 cases and 12.000 deaths in the United States alone. Dysfunction of AS in cancer is often associated with mutations in splicing-regulating genes and can drive tumour pathogenesis and progression. Besides these mutations, recent research has shown that epigenetic influences play a role in the splicing aberrations. For example, tumour growth causes hypoxia due to lack of oxygen in the tumour microenvironment, which induces hypoxia dependent AS. The consequence of AS dysregulation is the generation of different isoforms of proteins exclusively expressed in cancer. But the expression of proteins that we see in a healthy cell is also altered and shifted to different isoforms not exclusive to cancer. The specific splicing pattern we see in cancer and the transcriptome landscape can form excellent targets for prognosis and anticancer treatment because of their distinction from healthy cells. In this review, we will explain how AS works, the exact effect it has on acute myeloid leukaemia, and its use in prognosis and therapy. We will also talk about the unanswered questions on AS in cancer, how treatment resistance is built up due to AS, and the current problems of targeting AS for potential anticancer treatment."

Microtubules are polyproteins that assemble into rigid beams, that carry biologically relevant forces. To quantify this rigidity, much research has been done in the past 40 years. First measurements matched to Euler-Bernoulli beam theory to get the material properties of microtubules and found varying results. In the subsequent years in vitro work with various techniques of applying force on microtubules have given better estimates of rigidity, found that rigidity can depend on length and polymerization speed, and have shown that in many conditions more complicated beam models may be necessary. However, variation in sample preparation that yield different lattices or dynamics stabilization are still often present. This review serves to assess the state of the field, provide an overview, and propose a direction to attempt further microtubule rigidity studies in tandem with novel microscopy methods to try to link biophysical properties to the microtubule structure."

TTP is caused by low activity of metalloprotease called ADAMTS13, which is responsible for cleaving von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a multimeric glycoprotein that is involved in blood coagulation. Low activity of ADAMTS13 keeps vWF in its multimer state, triggering blood clotting more frequently. In acquired TTP, ADAMTS13 is inhibited by auto-antibodies, but the underlying mechanism of the autoimmunity is still unknown. TTP onsets are frequently reported after infection or vaccination of influenza A virus, especially H1N1 strain. Recent studies suggest that influenza may trigger TTP via molecular mimicry, a process where autoreactive T cells recognize influenza peptides that are cross-reactive with ADAMTS13 peptide. HLA DRB1*11 repeatedly reported as predisposing factor of TTP, while HLA DRB1*04 is considered as a protective factor. Two ADAMTS13 CUB2 domain peptide, FINVAPHAR (position 1324-1332) and LIRDTHSLR (position 1355-1363) were found to bind HLA DRB1*11 and HLA DRB1*03 respectively and can trigger CD4+ T cells response. This research aims to model molecular mimicry between influenza and ADAMTS13 peptide and to predict which influenza peptide can cross-react with ADAMTS13 peptides. We use netMHCIIpan to predict MHC binders and build BLAST-like model to score T cell cross-reactivity between influenza and ADAMTS13 peptide. PS-SCL data on T cell response is incorporated to improve the T cell reactivity prediction. Our model is able to bring up the previously known MHC-binders from ADAMTS13, LIRDTHSLR, as one of the most cross-reactive peptides. It aligns with influenza C peptide VLIADAKGL (nucleoprotein pos. 189-197). We also found several other potentially cross-reactive ADAMTS13 peptides that align with peptides from influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we applied this model to another environmentally-triggered autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. Our model predicts a self-foreign peptide pair that is proven to be cross-reactive in experiments as the most cross-reactive peptide pair. Taken together, our model is able to model molecular mimicry in autoimmune disease and predict the cross-reactive"

Het onderzoek had als doel om
de wetenschappelijke kennis over innovatief onderzoek uit te breiden. Dit is relevant voor ouders die
een schoolkeuze moeten maken voor hun kind en voor schoolorganisaties die (willen) innoveren. Om
uitgebreid kennis te vergaren over innovatief onderwijs, is aan de ene kant onderzoek gedaan naar het
discours in de nieuwsmedia. Dit is een breed toegankelijke kennisbron en bepaalt grotendeels hoe de
maatschappij tegen innovatief onderwijs aankijkt. Aan de andere kant is inzicht verkregen door te leren
van ideeën van onderwijskenners, die vanuit hun professionele achtergrond ervaringen hebben opgedaan
met betrekking tot innovatief onderwijs. Vervolgens werd bestudeerd in hoeverre de kennis van
onderwijskenners terugkomt in het nieuwsmediadiscours. Het onderzoek geeft daarom antwoord op de
vraag: Hoe zijn de ideeën van onderwijskenners over innovatief onderwijs terug te zien in de discoursen
in de Nederlandse nieuwsmedia? Om antwoord te vinden op de onderzoeksvraag werd een
discoursanalyse gedaan en zijn interviews afgenomen met onderwijskenners.
De nieuwsartikelen over innovatief onderwijs in de vier grootste Nederlandse kranten werden
geanalyseerd, om vervolgens de bestaande discoursen vast te stellen. Er zijn drie discoursen gevonden,
namelijk het vooruitstrevende, cynische en constructieve discours. De eerste twee discoursen geven de
perspectieven weer van respectievelijk de voor- en tegenstanders van innovatief onderwijs. Het
constructieve discours is meer genuanceerd en actoren binnen dit discours zijn niet uitgesproken voor
of tegen innovatief onderwijs, maar pleiten voor een constructief gesprek.
De ongestructureerde interviews met onderwijskenners waren erop gericht om inzicht te
verkrijgen in hun definitie van innovatief onderwijs. Hun antwoorden bevatten ideeën over de
aanleiding, definitie en gevolgen van innovatief onderwijs. De onderwijskenners hebben diverse
achtergronden in het onderwijs en dit betekent dat ze ook verschillende perspectieven hebben op
onderwijsinnovatie. Tegelijkertijd tonen bijna alle onderwijskenners begrip voor alternatieve
perspectieven en onderbouwen ze hun eigen ideeën vanuit hun specifieke achtergrond. 
In de nieuwsmedia en interviews met onderwijskenners komen veel onderwerpen (zoals
kansengelijkheid en onderwijskwaliteit) voorbij, die gerelateerd kunnen worden aan innovatief
onderwijs. De wijze waarop deze onderwerpen in de nieuwsmedia en door onderwijskenners gerelateerd
worden aan innovatief onderwijs, kan echter verschillen. Dit onderzoek laat zien dat de ideeën van
onderwijskenners meer diepgang en nuance hebben dan het discours in de nieuwsmedia. Daarmee zijn
de ideeën van onderwijskenners voornamelijk terug te zien in het constructieve discours over innovatief
onderwijs in de Nederlandse nieuwsmedia.
Dit onderzoek kent een aantal beperkingen en beschrijft mogelijkheden voor vervolgonderzoek.
Zo maakte de complexiteit van innovatief onderwijs het moeilijk om diepgang te krijgen.
Vervolgonderzoek zou daarom kunnen gaan over specifieke innovaties en contexten. Dit onderzoek
vormt daarbij een goede basis, omdat het inzicht geeft in de verschillende invalshoeken op innovatief
onderwijs en de gerelateerde onderwerpen. Ook kan diepgang bereikt worden door de selectiecriteria
van onderwijskenners verder aan te scherpen. Daarnaast vertoont dit onderzoek ook tekortkomingen
omdat het onduidelijk is wat precies de betekenis is van de gevonden discoursen voor de maatschappij.
Vervolgonderzoek zou de effecten voor een specifiek discours kunnen onderzoeken. Ten slotte heeft de
coronacrisis voor beperkingen gezorgd tijdens het onderzoeksproces. Het zou daarom interessant zijn
om dit onderzoek of een vorm van dit onderzoek te herhalen zonder beperkingen als gevolg van de coronacrisis."

The
most well-established method by which Arc influences synaptic plasticity is by enabling the
endocytosis of AMPA receptors. Recently it was shown that Arc originates from the Ty3/Gypsy
retrotransposon family. Similar to many endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) Arc was shown to bind and
package its own mRNA into virus like particles (VLPs). These particles were shown to release from
cells and ‘Infect’ neighboring neurons, where they were observed to undergo activity-dependent
translation. Indeed the virus-like properties of Arc is an emerging topic of interest. However, the
relationship between the protein’s ability to bind and sequester AMPA receptors and to oligomerize
and form capsids remains unclear. Here we review factors influencing the oligomerization of Arc and
propose that capsid formation and receptor endocytosis are two competing processes which may be
balanced by post translational modifications. We compare Arc to other endogenous retroviral
proteins and propose a model for the virus-like life cycle of Arc. This is important for understanding
the mechanism behind this type of intercellular communication and how it could affect synaptic
plasticity."

Second, a one-round Delphi procedure was fulfilled by the national working group of

Fourth, a hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted with the final set of 43 treatment goals. 
This resulted in a seven-cluster solution combined in three overarching categories: therapeutic 
context (including the clusters psychiatric comorbidity and psychoeducation), empowerment 
(involving resilience, stress regulation, and retrieval of body control), and function 
improvement (consisting of symptom and function improvement and ADL). The diverse set of 
clusters resembles the diversity of clinicians used in this study; ranging from psychiatrists and 
psychologists to various physical therapists and a nurse and neurologist. Limiting the results of 
the study is the relatively small sample size and only one round of the Delphi procedure. The 
follow-up study, as this is a preliminary study, is advised to extend the sample size and conduct 
at least three rounds. Nevertheless, the results of this study add to our knowledge of conversion

individualized treatment goals through shared decision making, or an evaluation session."
Metabolome of healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns,"['Damen, Jonne']","['Schouw, Yvonne van der']",2022-03-01T00:00:54Z,EN,['dietary pattern; metabolomics; systematic review; pathway analysis'],Biology of Disease,"Background and aim: Healthy diet has been shown to have a positive impact on health status. However, underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Metabolomics, in which metabolites in biofluids are analyzed and quantified, can be utilized to uncover metabolomic signatures associated with healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns. Utilizing metabolomics can improve understanding of the effects of healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns on metabolic processes and eventually provide a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms in which healthy diet contributes to health status. This review aimed to conduct a systematic search to provide an overview of relevant literature and to gather and analyze available data on the metabolomic signatures associated with healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns. 

Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials investigating endogenous metabolome in plasma, serum, or urine in subjects consuming a healthy dietary pattern compared to subjects consuming a relatively unhealthier dietary pattern. Metabolites reported as significant were extracted and used to compare metabolite class distributions between dietary patterns. Metabolites reported in multiple studies were highlighted. Pathway over-representation analyses of metabolites associated with a healthy or unhealthy dietary pattern were performed.

Results: 20 relevant randomized controlled trials were identified and article characteristics were summarized. Differences in metabolite class distributions were found between dietary patterns and metabolite class compositions were dependent on sample specimen. Several metabolites were associated with either a healthy or unhealthy dietary pattern in multiple articles. Pathway over-representation analyses show several metabolic pathways significantly enriched in healthy or unhealthy dietary patterns.

Conclusions: Differing metabolomic signatures were found to be associated with healthy and unhealthy dietary patterns. Identified differences do not provide a unanimous and clear consensus regarding connections to health status. Further research is needed to understand correlations between metabolomic profiles and health status. More comparable study parameters will enable future meta-analyses to more accurately uncover metabolomic profiles associated with dietary patterns."

significantly more affected, the disease has global reach, as 55 million people are suffering from it
worldwide. Alzheimer’s disease is still not entirely understood but an important factor is the
accumulation of a small protein (amyloid-beta) which grows into larger plaques throughout the
brain. Astrocytes, a cell-type involved in maintaining the central nervous system, are significantly
affected by this accumulation. As a result, astrocytes go into an altered, reactive state. The
implication of this state is not entirely clear, but changes in gene expression point towards a less
neuroprotective profile. Like in Alzheimer’s diseases, sex differences are observed within astrocytes
as well. The relationship between reactive astrocytes, sex and Alzheimer’s disease might thus be an
important link in understanding the disease. Therefore, this study performed a visual, exploratory
analysis on male and female mouse brains, comparing astrocytes between healthy brains and brains
expressing amyloid-beta plaques. Significant spatial relationships between amyloid-beta plaques and
reactive astrocytes were observed. Astrocyte reactivity, as well as increases in astrocyte amounts,
was somewhat concentrated to a particular brain region (the dentate gyrus). Finally, no significant
sex differences were found but further steps have been suggested. This study therefore confirmed a
relationship between astrocytes and amyloid-beta plaques and indicated several follow-up studies.
Overall, we provided relevant information regarding a relationship that is still not entirely
understood which might be important in, not only understanding Alzheimer’s Disease, but also
finding a cure."

adequate treatment. The Netherlands Triage Standard (NTS) is a decision support tool for 
telephone triage used at the Dutch out-of-hours general practitioner (OOH GP) cooperatives, 
which has never been validated against the clinical outcome sepsis. 
Aim: To determine the adequacy of the NTS urgency allocation for patients with sepsis. 
Method: A retrospective study using routine registration data from 2017-2019. Data were 
retrieved from the electronical medical records of the OOH GP cooperatives and were linked 
to the medical records of the patients’ own GP, hospital records and deaths registration. The 
primary outcome was adverse sepsis related outcome (ASRO), defined as (1) intensive careunit admission <7 days, or (2) death due to infection <30 days. For each entrance complaint, 
the odds ratio for the outcome ASRO was calculated. The allocated urgency was
dichotomised into high-urgent (U1-U2) and low-urgent (U3-U5) and the proportion of highurgent cases was calculated for each entrance complaint.
Results: 287.385 contacts were included of which 1721 had the outcome ASRO. Of all 
contacts with outcome ASRO, 58% were triaged as high-urgent. Complaints of arm or leg 
(26%), urinary problems (30%), diarrhoea (33%), cough (38%) and strange or suicidal 
behaviour (44%), general malaise (52%) had a significantly lower proportion triaged as high 
urgent. Of those, strange or suicidal behaviour and general malaise had the highest odds 
ratio for the outcome ASRO: 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.7) and 4.3 (95% CI: 3.8-5.0), respectively. 
Conclusion: Our study showed that the urgency allocation with telephone triage according 
to the NTS for patients with sepsis was suboptimal. The urgency allocation varied between 
the entrance complaints, of which some did not allocate urgency adequately."

The protest took the form of the IHA not providing viral samples to the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (the branch of the World Health Organization which carries out the surveillance of viruses). This protest occurred in the context of Indonesia’s H5N1 epidemic which had been diagnosed as the most concerning epidemic in the world at that time. 
This thesis is primarily concerned with why this protest was effective in determining the policy and decisions of the WHO. Prior to interrogating what specific characteristics contributed to the effectiveness of the protest, this thesis establishes the interests and powers of the two parties at the centre of the protest, the IHA and the WHO. Drawing from the critical literature and primary sources, this thesis demonstrates that the global health interests of the WHO conflicted with those of the IHA and examines the event that led the IHA to begin its protest. The thesis then interrogates the protest itself, examining what characteristics enabled the protest to be effective. This analysis concludes that the threat presented by the IHA’s protest was core to its effectiveness with factors including the legitimacy, length specificity of the protest’s target playing the role of contributing factors. The final section of this thesis will analyse that the implications of the protest fell short of what the IHA sought when it entered this endeavour. Additionally, this section will summarise some of the implications of the IHA’s protest in light of the 2020 covid-19 pandemic."

De evaluatierondes van het ontwerpproces van het oefenboek hebben aangetoond dat aandacht voor historisch redeneren een welkome toevoeging is aan het oefenmateriaal voor het centraal examen. Daarnaast heb ik aangetoond dat vaardigheidsontwikkeling gestimuleerd kan worden door een adaptieve aanpak. Deze aanpak kan door middel van formatieve evaluatie bereikt worden. Tot slot blijkt uit het onderzoek dat (vak)didactisch onderzoek en de onderwijspraktijk baat hebben bij de ontwikkeling van doelgericht vaardigheidsonderwijs."

as a probability updating game: a zero-sum game between a host and a contestant. An instance
of a probability updating game is made from rewriting the Monty Hall problem as a game. It
is proved that if the host plays a strategy that satisfies the RCAR condition, it plays worst-case
optimally and the probabilities can be updated robustly for the contestant. We study whether
RCAR still characterises Nash equilibria when the zero-sum constraint or the one-shot constraint
of these games are removed. We found that if RCAR characterises optimality for a zero-sum,
one-shot probability updating game, it also characterises optimality for the finitely repeated
game. Moreover, we conclude from empirical analysis that if RCAR characterises optimality
for a zero-sum probability updating game, it may also characterise optimality for a moderately
competitive non-zero-sum game."

These therapeutics are made to target and break specific parts of the molecular machinery that causes cancer cells to grow uncontrollably. The smoking-related non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) relies, in 60% of cases, heavily on Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). EGF signals for cells to grow and this cancer type produces many more EGF receptors (EGFR) than it should, receiving many more growth signals than it should. Drugs that block EGFR signaling, like gefitinib and erlotinib proved to be an effective targeted therapy. However, prolonged treatment resulted in drug-resistant cancer cells, due to mutations in EGFR. New drugs were developed against this EGFR mutant, like afatinib, but once again the cancer would come back having acquired a resistance to the first and second line of drugs. It was discovered that upon the initial treatment with these cancer drugs, a fraction of the cells would survive and that from these cells a resistant cancer would grow. Even if the mutations that cause drug resistance are not present in any cancer cells at the time of treatment, a portion would still survive. In this study, we took a look at the proteins that make up the molecular machinery of NSCLC cells. We observed how adaptations in the regulation of this machinery allowed these cancer cells to survive. We discovered that only cells which are closest to each other survive afatinib treatment and that they make stronger connections between each other. Through these connections, they signal to each other to survive and after three days, to grow again. Inhibiting these survival signals at the same time as afatinib treatment may be enough to prevent cancer recurrence."

It is a rare tumor, therefore a multicenter study is needed to gather a sufficiently large amount of images. In this study, we compared two datasets of diffusion weighted images (DWI) coming from a single center in the Netherlands and from centers across Europe. The databases, respectively of 51 and 126 images from 25 and 73 patients. Acquisition parameters and patient information were analyzed to quantify inter and intra center variability and the effect of those on mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). From the two datasets, high variability has been observed in acquisition parameters and patients’ information. No particular links to the ADC values was found, possibly due to the large amount of data missing from some of the images, especially b-values. In the second part of the study, a DWI scan on a healthy subject was performed using echo time, voxel dimension and b-values most commonly found in the datasets. Varying one parameter at a time and keeping the other fixed, a total of 10 images were acquired. The aim was to isolate the effect of each acquisition parameter on mean ADC and differences from 1.0% up to 17.7% were found in mean ADC. These findings show how important it is to adhere to a strict set of acquisition parameters, in order to minimize as much as possible their variability and influence on ADC values."
"The Relation between Hedonic and Eudaemonic Emotion Crafting and Well-Being: The

So far, most studies in this field have only focused on the reactive frame of emotion regulation and very little attention has been paid to the role of proactive emotion regulation. 
The current study aims to explore the proactive counterpart of emotion regulation: emotion 
crafting. Based on Self-Determination Theory, this study examines the link between emotion 
crafting (i.e., eudaemonic and hedonic emotions emotion crafting) and well-being (i.e., life 
satisfaction and eudaemonic well-being). Additionally, this study considered the role of basic 
psychological need satisfaction as a mediator in these relations. Participants were 178 young 
adults with the age range 18-35 (Mage = 24.06; SD = 3.37; 79.2% female) who filled out 
questionnaires concerning the study variables on a one-time point. Findings provide initial 
evidence that engaging in general emotion crafting behavior significantly enhances life 
satisfaction via basic psychological needs satisfaction. A similar full mediation effect through 
need satisfaction was found for eudaemonic emotion crafting and life satisfaction, whereas 
hedonic emotion crafting and life satisfaction were partially mediated by need satisfaction. 
Furthermore, the relations between general, hedonic, and eudaemonic emotion crafting, and 
the outcome of eudaemonic well-being were significant, positive, and partially mediated by 
need satisfaction. This study highlights the important role need satisfaction plays in the 
complex relation between emotion crafting and well-being. The findings present an important 
contribution to the latest field of emotion research."
Taalbeleid in het voorgezet middelbaar onderwijs: een exploratief onderzoek naar de factoren van succesvol taalbeleid op vmbo-scholen,"['Hulst, Donna van der']","['Bouwer, Renske']",2022-03-04T00:00:28Z,NL,['taalbeleid; schoolbreed; vmbo; vo; voortgezet onderwijs; implementatie; taalbeleidsplan; taal en leren; taalvaardigheid;'],Nederlandse taal en cultuur: educatie en communicatie,"Het vraagstuk rond taal en leren is vandaag nog even actueel. Leersucces is van meer factoren afhankelijk dan alleen taalvaardigheid, maar taalvaardigheid drukt een behoorlijke stempel op de resultaten en slagingskansen van leerlingen. Op landelijk niveau is het taalvaardigheidsprobleem van leerlingen evident, zo blijkt uit meerdere actuele rapporten. Met name de taalvaardigheid van vmbo-leerlingen is problematisch. Bijna 1 op de vier vijftienjarigen heeft op dit moment een taalachterstand en het aantal leerlingen met een (te) lage taalvaardigheid dat doorstroomt naar het mbo groeit. 
Goed taalbeleid is essentieel om de taalvaardigheid van leerlingen op niveau te krijgen en te houden. De vrijheid die vo-scholen krijgen met betrekking tot het vormgeven van taalbeleid is de aanleiding geweest onderzoek te doen naar de precieze verschillen en overeenkomsten in taalbeleid tussen scholen. Het in kaart brengen van deze verschillen is de eerste stap naar bewustzijn. 
Omdat het probleem van de lage taalvaardigheid onder jongeren bij de vmbo-leerlingen aanzienlijk is, heeft dit onderzoek zich specifiek op vmbo-scholen gericht. Het doel van dit onderzoek is zicht krijgen op hoe (de implementatie van) taalbeleid op vmbo-scholen eruitziet. Er is een profiel van taalbeleid geschetst aan de hand van zes factoren, namelijk 1. visie op taal, 2. coördinatie van de implementatie, 3. professionaliseren van docenten, 4. monitoren van leerlingen, 5. rijke leesomgeving en 6. taalgericht onderwijs. Deze factoren zijn op verschillende vmbo-scholen onderzocht aan de hand van een analyse van de taalbeleidsplannen. Deze analyse is vervolgens verder uitgediept aan de hand van focusgroep-interviews met taalcoördinatoren, directieleden en docenten. 
Uit de resultaten van de taalbeleidsplannen blijkt dat een of meerdere vormen van taalbeleid in alle scholen aanwezig is. Alle scholen formuleren een visie op taal en hebben een taalcoördinator aangesteld. Deze persoon blijkt een belangrijke rol te spelen in de coördinatie, implementatie en vernieuwing van taalbeleid. Verschillen in concrete acties zijn aanwezig. Waar de ene school verschillende betrokkenen verantwoordelijk maakt voor de concrete uitvoering van opgesteld beleid, blijft de ander steken op het definiëren van taalbeleid en resultaten van behoefteonderzoek binnen de school. Wat betreft monitoring screenen scholen leerlingen in de onderbouw via methodeafhankelijke toetsen. Waar de ene school naar aanleiding van de leerlingmonitoring ondersteuning op leerlingniveau inzet (wat vervolgens beperkt blijft tot dispensatie of ondersteuningsuren buiten de les), gaat de andere school over tot een schoolbrede interventie. Op het gebied van een rijke leesomgeving hebben alle scholen contact met de plaatselijke bibliotheek. Mediatheken zijn wegbezuinigd. 
Uit de resultaten van de interviews blijkt taalbeleid geen onderdeel uit te maken van schoolbreed overleg. Scholen die hiervoor wel structureel tijd en ruimte in de jaaragenda aanbrengen lijken daarvan de vruchten te plukken: op deze scholen is een groter draagvlak zichtbaar. Opvallend is dat op geen enkele school taalbeleid een onderdeel is van de professionalisering van docenten: in lesbezoeken en functioneringsgesprekken komt dit thema niet aan de orde. Wel zijn er plannen om docenten schoolbreed te scholen, denk aan het geven van NT2-ondersteuning. 
Op basis van dit onderzoek wordt allereerst geadviseerd concretere richtlijnen voor de invulling van taalbeleid op landelijk niveau vast te leggen. Daardoor zou Inspectie van Onderwijs taalbeleid specifiek op schoolniveau kunnen toetsen en homogeniteit tussen scholen bevorderen. Daarnaast reikt dit onderzoek een aantal praktische aanbevelingen voor schoolleidingen aan."

Daarbij moet het niet uitmaken of iemand voor een kniebreuk een arts ziet of jarenlang verschillende zorgverleners ontmoet vanwege een tumor. Onderzoek wijst echter uit dat communicatie bij lange zorgtrajecten, zoals bij oncologiepatiënten het geval is, een belangrijke rol speelt. Goede arts-patiëntcommunicatie draagt eraan bij om bij oncologiepatiënten angsten en zorgen te verminderen. Het Erasmus MC reikt aan de oncologiepatiënten momenteel een zorggids uit met alle informatie over het hele zorgtraject. De patiënten ontvangen al deze informatie in één keer aan het begin van hun zorgpad. Het Erasmus MC wil de informatie meer op maat aanbieden om zo meer in de informatiebehoefte van oncologiepatiënten te voorzien. Daarom is in dit onderzoek in kaart gebracht wat de behoefte van oncologiepatiënten is ten aanzien van informatie-onderwerpen, het moment van informatieverstrekking en via welk kanaal oncologiepatiënten de informatie willen ontvangen. Daarnaast is onderzocht of het type patiënt (informatiezoeker of informatiemijder) samenhangt met de informatiebehoefte.

Om dit te onderzoeken is een kwantitatief onderzoek uitgevoerd, waarvoor een online vragenlijst is gemaakt. De deelnemers werd gevraagd om vragen te beantwoorden over hoe zij omgaan met een stressvolle situatie, welke informatie-onderwerpen zij belangrijk vinden, op welk moment zij informatie willen ontvangen en via welk kanaal zij de informatie willen ontvangen. De vragenlijst is via verschillende interne en externe kanalen van het Erasmus MC verspreid. Het kwantitatieve onderzoek leverde in totaal 128 deelnemers op. Hieruit blijkt dat oncologiepatiënten in principe over alle onderwerpen informatie willen ontvangen. Respectievelijk hebben oncologiepatiënten een sterke voorkeur voor de onderwerpen uitslagen, resultaat van een behandeling, (na)controles en complicaties en bijwerkingen. Het type patiënt (informatiezoeker of informatiemijder) bleek enkel samen te hangen met een sterke voorkeur voor informatie over polikliniekbezoeken, mentale gezondheid en internetsites en adressen. Wat betreft het moment van informatieverstrekking toont dit onderzoek aan dat patiënten het liefst in één keer informatie willen ontvangen aan het begin van het traject. Een deel van de patiënten geeft aan dat zij zowel in één keer als gedoseerd informatie wil ontvangen. Al die informatie willen oncologiepatiënten mondeling of schriftelijk ontvangen.

Op basis van de resultaten is een aantal aanbevelingen geformuleerd. De rode lijn van deze aanbevelingen is dat zorgverleners aan het begin van een zorgtraject aan de oncologiepatiënt navragen welke informatie de patiënt wil ontvangen, op welk moment en via welk kanaal. Als voorbeeld is een korte vragenlijst samengesteld die terug te vinden is in Bijlage VI. Hiermee kan de zorgverlener kort peilen wat de informatiebehoefte is van de patiënt, zodat de zorgverlener de informatievoorziening beter op maat kan aanbieden."

This research contributes to explore what the audit and assurance process consists of on non- financial data, in other words ethical, social and environmental accounting (ESEA). To accomplish this, a generic model was developed through the examination of 10 different ESEA methods. The 10 methods were selected on specific criteria. Next, we looked at which activities in the process of the generic model could be improved. By analyzing the generic model, it was found that recommending specific information (indicators) for further audit can be an area for improvement. The improvements are performed by introducing analytical features, in particular Computer Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques. The CAATTs, were chosen based on the current state of the openESEA tool. Among various techniques, three techniques have been implemented in openESEA, namely scoring scheme, anomaly detection and visualization. Subsequently, we looked at the usability and applicability of the functionalities through internal and external validation with experts. All in all, this research has led towards improving the audit process and introducing appropriate analytical features in OpenESEA."

Popular with the countercultures and initially not accepted by the scientific community, Gaia has always bordered on pseudoscience. A fair share of the critiques Gaia has attracted are related to Gaia’s central metaphor which likens Gaia to an ‘organism’. This organism metaphor has played an important role in the development of Gaia Theory, and this paper shows 
how the organism metaphor influenced the scientific discourse surrounding Gaia Theory. The organism metaphor opposed the more reductionistic scientific worldviews of the Neo-Darwinists who critiqued Gaia. Moreover, Gaia’s organism metaphor allows for contradictory interpretations, and this aspect of the organism 
metaphor can be seen as an explanation as to why Gaia Theory was simultaneously widely discussed and ridiculed by scientists. Because of its contradictory nature, the organism metaphor is arguably too broad for what Lovelock tries to achieve with it, namely being a spearhead for green movements."

Especially since the start of the romance genre with Chrétien de Troyes’s Chevalier de la charrete there has been a fascination with the love triangle between Lancelot, Guenevere, and Arthur. Chretien might have introduced the romance between Lancelot and Guenevere, but their romance has lived on and been reinterpreted since its first appearance. In this paper Thomas Malory’s Le Morte Darthur will be used as the starting point to analyse two modern interpretations of the love triangle compared to the medieval version of the romance. Marion Zimmer Bradley’s The Mists of Avalon and Amy Rose Capetta and Cori McCarthy’s Once & Future will be analysed to compare and contrast how the love triangle has evolved and changed and what influence these changes have on the legend. Adaptations of popular works are able to critique the past and critique the contemporary period, but they are also able to change the tale, address topics that weren’t addressed in the original text, and subvert genre and expectations in dynamic ways. This paper will explore the malleability of the Arthurian legend and how the feminist movement, a developing social and political consciousness, and the need for stories that have been omitted or ignored are added onto the story and the love triangle between Lancelot, Guenevere and Arthur."

This research project takes up Alison Kafer’s remark in Feminist. Queer. Crip. (2013) that the largest group of people with disabilities, such as those with diabetes, do not consider themselves disabled or crip. I investigate the question “why diabetes can(not) be considered a dis/ability” through a mixed method approach of autoethnography, semistructured qualitative interviews, and textual and cultural analysis. Why is diabetes generally not seen as a disability from the perspective of the disability community and from those who are diabetic? What does that reveal about how diabetes and disability are viewed in scholarship and in society? And what does say about the values attached to normative (dis)abled embodiments? In four chapters that weave together theory and lived experience, I investigate disability discourse, disability/diabetes identity, neoliberal agentic subjectivity in diabetes care, and alternative, queer, and affective modes of kinship and care. Following Robert McRuer and Lisa Johnson (2014), I aim to create a “cripistemelogy” (or a crip epistemology) of diabetes type 1.  Using queer, feminist, and disability scholarship, I contend that diabetes type 1 is scripted as a medical disease that is embedded in ‘compulsory able-bodiedness’ (McRuer [2006] 2017) which consequently leaves the lived, cultural experiences undertheorised. The hypothesis of the thesis is that personal narratives that highlight the (un)stable aspects of diabetes can offer an entry into destabilising, questioning, and queering categories of (dis)abled embodiment. Indeed, I offer ways of imagining (un)stable diabetic embodiment as a site of resistance that open up new potentialities for radical inclusivity (Keating 2013). Through a cripistemological queering of diabetes, I offer an approach of dis/ability, which is an internal critique towards neoliberal notions of the (dis)abled body, or, phrased differently, an internal critique towards (st)able-bodiedness."

However, when the analysis is performed on a large number of data, carrying out the analysis requires the adoption of automatic systems and a certain level of experience. The goal of the following project was to develop an online tutorial and assistant notebook by combining ImageJ functionalities and Python in the Jupyter Notebook
platform. For this purpose, the python package PyImageJ has been implemented within python-based functions. Creating reproducible and ready-to-use analytical pipelines potentially reduced the time and effort required to perform the analysis. Moreover, providing this analytical tool help to standardized the processing steps and increased the reproducibility of the image analysis. The series of notebooks presented in this project both provided a learning tool to understand how to functionally operate with the proposed packages and an assistant tool to help the researchers to carry out their analysis. A series of interviews were performed on experts and potential users of this product. This step aimed to understand the user context and the possible applications of the final product of this project. Finally, an evaluation process was
performed to assess the accuracy and the efficiency of the developed analytical method. This last evaluating step highlighted the necessity to further investigate the performance of the final product. Nevertheless, despite the complexity and the multiple limitations, the automatization of ImageJ 1.x functionalities throughout Python 3.x was

To determine the resilience of these ecosystems, we tracked the resistance and recovery of beach grass Ammophila arenaria along the bio-geomorphological dune gradient after disturbance (clipping of aboveground biomass) early in the growing season. As a measure of resilience, we investigated both the resistance, indicated by the capacity for the number and the diameter of the shoots to not decrease following disturbance, and the recovery, indicated by the capacity for the leaves to grow to pre-disturbance levels. 
We found the resilience of A. arenaria to be dependent on its location along the bio-geomorphological dune gradient, where the beach showed the highest degree of resilience, followed by intermediate resilience at the white dunes and the worst resilience at the grey dunes. Nonetheless, disturbance of A. arenaria early in the growing season generally did not impact the capacity for growth by the end of the season. In addition, we found that the resilience of A. arenaria along the dune gradient varied between the four studied locations, and was dependent on its height above sea-level and distance from the waterline, as well as the salinity, acidity and organic matter content of the soil, and the amount of surrounding vegetation. Combining these findings, we think that the resilience of A. arenaria and consequently that of coastal dune ecosystems, while influenced by various (a)biotic properties, is predominantly dependent on the availability of nutrients along the bio-geomorphological gradient."

Correcting sea level observations for the wind influence helps to improve estimates of long-term rates of sea-level rise. We study the wind influence on multi-decadal sea-level variability and trend along the Dutch coast using three physically-based, multi-linear regression models. These models relate sea level and wind forcing either using zonal and meridional wind speeds or large-scale pressure patterns. We use annual mean sea level observations from six tide gauge stations spread along the Dutch coast covering 1890 to 2020, and surface wind and pressure data from the ERA5 and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis data sets, covering 1950 to 2020 and 1836 to 2015, respectively. The results from the regression analysis show a robust multi-decadal variability of wind influence on sea-level change with an amplitude of around 1 cm and a period of 40 to 60 years. This multi-decadal mode of variability is responsible for an average drop in sea level of 0.5 mm/yr over the last 40 years. Furthermore, it is shown that the multi-decadal wind variability is related to the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV). A regression analysis relating the low-frequency variability and AMV from 1950 to 2015 shows that the AMV explains a large part of the wind variability. Finally, the three regression models are applied to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) historical and future climate scenario data to make projections of the wind impact on sea-level change along the Dutch coast for the 21st century. We do not find significant effects of wind on sea-level rise for the Dutch coast during the 21st century, which contrasts earlier findings for the German Bight."
The complex interplay between Plasmodium and the hepatocyte: Potential therapeutic targets,"['Brouwers, Tamara']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-03-01T00:00:59Z,EN,[],Infection and Immunity,"Malaria is one of the most life-threatening infectious diseases in humans. It is mostly prevalent in (sub)tropical areas; Sub-Saharan Africa in particular accounts for more than 90% of the cases and deaths. Malaria is a vector-borne disease, caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium and transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito. Only six Plasmodium species are able to infect humans; Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale curtisi, Plasmodium ovale wallickeri, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi, with P. falciparum being the leading cause of malaria in young African children.

The life cycle of the malaria parasite starts when a female Anopheles mosquito injects infective sporozoites from its salivary gland into the human skin. The sporozoites migrate to the liver, where they infect hepatocytes and grow exponentially. Following their release into the bloodstream, the parasites start infecting red blood cells, which results in the establishment of the first clinical symptoms and can even lead to death of the host. Another mosquito bite transfers free parasites present in the bloodstream back to the mosquito, allowing them to be transmitted to a new human host.

Up until now, the many attempts to reduce the amount of malaria cases have largely been unsuccessful. Bed nets and insecticides are not effective enough, and even though antimalarials are a common way to treat the disease, drug resistance of the parasite is a rising problem. Additionally, the long-term co-evolution between Plasmodium and the human population has pressured the parasite to become highly adaptable to its host, making malaria very hard to eradicate. However, a crucial step towards elimination was made recently, when the first malaria vaccine was officially approved by the World Health Organization. Although the RTS,S vaccine is expected to have a significant effect on improving child survival, research into the parasite’s infection cycle and establishing new therapeutic targets remains important to be able to fully eradicate malaria from the human population. 

Because the liver phase of the parasite’s infection cycle is clinically silent, inhibition of successful liver stage development will prevent onset of disease. This makes the liver stage a very interesting target for vaccination. To identify potential therapeutic targets, it is important to fully understand the complex interactions that take place between the malaria parasite and liver cell. 

First, successful entry of the malaria parasite into liver cells is mediated by the binding of the circumsporozoite surface protein, the major surface protein of the parasite, to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell surface. One of the major challenges that the malaria parasite faces within a liver cell is the process of autophagy, which specifically targets the pathogen for elimination. While indeed a lot of the parasites are killed, the majority is able to escape this destruction mechanism. Moreover, it appears that the malaria parasite uses the autophagy pathway to obtain nutrients required for growth and development. Research has also shown that the Plasmodium parasite is able to form close interactions with liver cell organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, golgi network and host mitochondria. In fact, it seems that these connections with the host are necessary for the malaria parasite to survive, probably because they allow the pathogen to secure building blocks and nutrients. The liver stage of the parasite’s infection cycle thus contains lots of possibilities for therapeutic intervention. This thesis therefore elaborates on the various host factors that are utilized by the malaria parasite to complete liver stage development and gives insight into how these interactions enable therapeutic intervention."
Quantification of Biodiversity in Life Cycle Analysis - Literature assessment on the latest developments for biodiversity quantification in LCA frameworks,"['Manders, Ellen']","['Krijgsheld, Pauline']",2022-03-08T00:00:43Z,EN,['life cycle analysis; biodiversity; literature assessment'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"Research on biodiversity loss due to human activities has gained serious interest because of major decrease in biodiversity over the last century. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is a widely used multistep management tool to assess the environmental impacts of the entire life cycle of a human artefact: a product, a service, or an activity. In four steps, the goal and scope of an assessment are defined, data is collected, impacts are calculated, and conclusions are drawn to make better business decisions. It creates a complete product assessment, from the very first to the very last life stage of the product. In the third step of an LCA, the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), the impact on biodiversity can be quantified. Biodiversity quantification is hard, generally, because of lacking data. ReCiPe2016 is an LCA method mainly used in the Netherlands nowadays. Since ReCiPe2016, development on biodiversity quantification has been ongoing.

This literature assessment includes five methods: ReCiPe2016, IMPACT World+, LC-IMPACT, PBF, and BIA+. The methods are assessed on how they address the four main knowledge gaps for biodiversity quantification: ‘species diversity’, ‘spatial resolution assessment vs data’, ‘drivers for biodiversity loss’, and ‘trade-off LCA and biology’. The five methods are introduced individually, their general framework and how they include biodiversity quantification is explained. Afterwards is shown how each knowledge gap is addressed by the methods. This assessment shows, although improvements have been introduced for all gaps in the last few years, some are better covered than others. Future development on biodiversity in LCA would be to include ecosystem services and positive impacts on biodiversity. Altogether, LCA results should always be interpreted with care and with acknowledgement for the modelling choices, hypotheses, and limitations."

Transposons are DNA sequences that can relocate to other positions in one or multiple genomes using a transposase gene. Most transposons carry additional passengers genes that are not necessary for relocation, such as antibiotic resistance genes. These passenger genes can spread in bacterial populations via transposons, exacerbating the global antibiotic resistance problem. To better understand the mechanics behind transposons and their spread through populations we could make use of metagenomics. While some bioinformatical tools already exist to detect transposons in data, to our knowledge no known tool can detect (novel) transposon sequences in metagenomic data. Our proposed method for a tool that is able to do this is based on pHMMs from protein domains of transposons that were extracted from the MGEdb. We tested our proposed models using the original database they are based on and by creating a simulated metagenomic dataset from 8 well-annotated genomes and 3 plasmids. The models were able to detect the vast majority of transposons included in the database, and the results from the metagenomic dataset reveal suspect transposons in the data, possibly linked to Tn4652 and Tn7."
A Decentralized Governance Framework for Open Source Software Organizations,"['Siu, Jozef']","['Jansen, Slinger']",2022-03-15T00:01:02Z,EN,"['Decentralized Autonomous Organizations; Open Source Software, Governance; Governance Structures; Blockchain; Commons; Community; Ecosystems; DAO for OSS Governance Framework']",Business Informatics,"Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) are a nascent phenomenon. The execution and immutable registration of smart contracts on blockchains have presented the opportunity for smart contracts to be used in the governance of decentralized organizations in an autonomous manner. They enable new forms of decentralized decision making processes, incentive designs and more. 

As DAOs can be traced back to Open Source Software(OSS) and are similarly founded on decentralization and transparency, this study approaches DAO governance from an OSS perspective. The study contributes an understanding of DAO governance from the perspective of OSS project governance for OSS organizations. This research proposes the \textit{DAO for OSS governance framework}, that presents the governance dimensions and the respective governance concepts for a DAO for OSS.

Four case studies were conducted with DAOs, ranging from starting DAOs to mature DAOs. The mature DAOs have a complete governance model and utilize complex governance mechanisms. The case studies show that the framework is (I) useful for starting DAOs to understand the governance structures and governance considerations, (II) it serves as an intermediate check for DAOs to measure the maturity of their governance, (III) it serves as a research framework to analyze DAOs and (IV) it can be used as a checklist to track governance growth as a DAO develops. 

The presented DAO for OSS governance framework provides a solid foundation for further research of DAO governance and contributes to the understanding of DAO for OSS governance."
Covalent modification of peptide libraries to target the active site of heparanase in mRNA display,"['Dongen, David van']","['Jongkees, S.A.K.']",2022-03-23T00:00:27Z,EN,['heparanase; mRNA display; CuAAC; click chemistry; in vitro translation; chemical biology; drug discovery'],Drug Innovation,"Heparanase (HPSE) cleaves the chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans at cleavage sites between glucuronic acid and sulfated glucosamine residues (endo-β-glucuronidase). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are crucial in maintaining structural integrity of basement membranes, cell surfaces and extracellular matrixes (ECM). Heparan sulfate chains bind to a vast array of signaling molecules, such as growth factors, chemokines and cytokines. By cleaving heparan sulfate chains and proteoglycans, these signaling molecules will be released and ECM and membranes will be remodelled. In adults, the basal level of HPSE activity is rather low. HPSE expression and activity are increased in many diseases, and more importantly in most types of tumors. In tumors, elevated HPSE activity plays a role in angiogenesis, metastasis, cell proliferation and cell invasion. This makes HPSE an interesting target for anti-cancer therapies. Current HPSE inhibitors in clinical trials are all sulfated polysaccharides, which entail anticoagulant side-effects. Peptides are a potential class of HPSE inhibitors without anticoagulant effect, but they remain understudied. In this thesis, a method for chemical modification of peptide libraries to selectively target the enzyme’s active site in high-throughput screenings was developed and optimised. The modification is a heparan-sulfate disaccharide with an azide-bearing aromatic aglycone, being attached to the peptide libraries by a well-established copper(I)-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). The glycan-modified libraries were used in RaPID mRNA display, and will be used in the future in cDNA-TRAP display, to screen for potential HPSE inhibitors. RaPID mRNA display against HPSE did not lead to hits because of recurring truncation issues with the libraries, but the cDNA-TRAP display system could overcome this. The optimised click conditions can also be exploited in future selections with similar goals to modify libraries with different substrates for more
specific targeting of the target."
Assessment of selective laser sintering (SLS) 3D printing as a manufacturing technique for pediatric dosage forms,"['Zhelezniakov, Maksim']","['Kok, Robbert Jan']",2022-03-22T01:00:32Z,EN,['Selective laser sintering; pediatric pharmaceutics; personalized medicine; orodispersible tablets; mini-tablets; porosity; laser energy density'],Drug Innovation,"Heterogeneity of the pediatric population means that several different requirements must be met in order to provide the pediatric population with medication suited to their needs. Due to different rates of development in terms of pharmacokinetics as well as motor skills children require tailored dosage forms where the dose of the active pharmacological ingredient (API) can be modified to their needs and the size of the medication is acceptable in order to avoid choking on the medications. In order to make sure that the child obtains the intended dose it is crucial that the developed dosage forms are palatable, ensuring adherence to the treatment. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) has been employed as an additive manufacturing method capable of utilizing several thermoplastic and pharmaceutical grade polymer powders while providing flexibility in the manufacturing process due to its variable parameters as well as the ability to manufacture complex structures. Key parameters associated with dosage form manufacturing have to do with the energy density applied to the formulation powder which allows particles to undergo a sintering process where they are fused together though bridge formation without fully fusing together in a melt. Concerning energy density, Laser scanning speed (LSS), heating temperature and scan spacing have been identified as parameters with the most significant effect on the composition of the matrix. Oro-dispersible tablets (ODTs) as well as mini tablets have been chosen as key dosage forms for younger segments of the pediatric population as they present no swallowing difficulties.
Vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (KVA64) was shown to be an optimal polymer for formation of ODTs. With favorable thermal properties such as Tg of ~100C as well as optimal spherical morphology and a relatively low particle size, at high LSS KVA64 was shown to be able to establish highly porous matrices that allowed for incorporation of various taste masking excipients as well as shielding of thermosensitive API by lowering printing temperature via plasticization.
In order to manufacture minitablets, the laser scanning speed had to be lowered significantly and more coarse polymers were incorporated, allowing for denser formulations with reduced porosity. Drug release profiles were also tailored though utilization of Ethyl cellulose (EC) and poly (vinyl alcohol)–poly(ethylene glycol) graft copolymer (KIR) which due to their different chemical properties as well as size and morphology allow for sustained and instant release of API respectively. Incorporation of dual APIs was also demonstrated via matrix manipulation possible due to SLS’s layer by layer manufacturing.
Manipulation of release profiles has also been shown for standard tablet formulations (10 mm) where altering the shape and the polymeric material by giving it more surface area as well modifying its internal structure to be more porous as in the case of a 95% pure Paracetamol dosage form allows for tailored drug release profiles."

"HIV patients' altered cancer burden: behaviour, immunodeficiency, or drug-induced mutagenesis?","['Haan, Suzanne den']","['Boxtel, Ruben van']",2022-03-18T00:00:31Z,EN,[],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Humaan immunodeficiëntie virus (HIV) is ontdekt in het begin van de tachtigerjaren en binnen tien jaar was al het eerste antivirale medicijn goedgekeurd door de medicijnagentschappen. De voornaamste doodsoorzaak van HIV-patiënten is het overlijden aan kanker. Voor dat de medicijnen voor HIV infecties op de markt waren, was dit vooral een zeldzame soort bloedvatkanker (Kaposi sarcoom), lymfeklierkanker (non-hodgkinlymfoom) en baarmoederhalskanker. Echter, sinds de komst van de medicijnen zijn de type kankers die voorkomen bij HIV-patiënten veranderd. Hiervoor zijn meerdere oorzaken, die allemaal onafhankelijk invloed kunnen hebben op tumorontwikkeling. In deze review worden de verschillende oorzaken uiteengezet.

HIV valt een bepaald type witte bloedcel aan: de CD4-cellen. Hierdoor neemt het totale aantal CD4-cellen in je bloed af, terwijl deze nodig zijn voor het afweermechanisme tegen HIV. HIV valt juist die cellen aan die nodig zijn om HIV eigenlijk weer ‘op te ruimen’. Echter, die antivirale medicijnen die HIV-patiënten krijgen, verhogen dus onder andere het aantal CD4-cellen in je bloed. Hierdoor is je lichaam ook weer iets beter bestand tegen andere infecties en ziektes. Want als je immuunsysteem plat ligt, krijgen tumoren ook meer de kans om te ontwikkelen en te groeien. Dit kan in eerste instantie verklaren waarom er zo een verandering is in type kankers die voorkomen bij HIV-patiënten.

Onder de HIV-patiënten is er een verhoogd aantal rokers en alcoholisten. Dit brengt ook risico’s met zich mee: roken kan leiden tot longkanker, overmatig alcohol gebruik kan onder andere leiden tot leverkanker. Verder zijn HIV-patiënten ook vatbaarder voor co-infecties met andere virussen: zoals humaan papillomavirus (HPV) wat onder meer baarmoederhalskanker kan veroorzaken.

Echter is het ook van belang om bijwerkingen van de antivirale medicijnen te detecteren, om zo te achterhalen wat er eventueel verbeterd kan worden bij deze medicijnen. Antivirale medicijnen die bedoeld zijn om HIV en geïnfecteerde cellen te beschadigen, kunnen deze beschadigingen ook veroorzaken in gezonde cellen. De schade in deze gezonde cellen kan op hele kleine schaal plaatsvinden, zoals bijvoorbeeld door mutaties in het DNA of genetische recombinatie. Meerdere studies hebben laten zien dat dit mogelijk is, vooral de medicijnen die de reverse-transcriptase (die het HIV RNA omzet in DNA) afremmen. Deze schade kan uiteindelijk een trigger zijn voor kankerontwikkeling, bijvoorbeeld wanneer er een gen wordt uitgeschakeld die nodig is om de kanker te onderdrukken.

Aangezien HIV patiënten deze medicijnen vrijwel dagelijks moeten slikken is het belangrijk om de mogelijke bijwerkingen op het DNA te blijven onderzoeken. Voor de veiligheid van de medicijnen op langere termijn is het van belang dat er grote cohort studies worden gedaan waarbij wordt gekeken naar de type kankers van HIV patiënten, inclusief welke medicijnen er voorgeschreven zijn voor de patiënten, wat voor infecties hebben plaatsgevonden en welke schadelijke levensstijlen de patiënten hebben. Hiermee kan er wellicht een verband gevonden worden tussen een type medicijn en een type kanker."

covering more than 90 questions, based on seven themes related to the management in
the periparturient period was conducted on 36 farmers (17 from the Netherlands and 19
from Belgium). The results were visualized and linked to a new key performance
indicator: the lactation onset value (LOV). This KPI is created to provide a method for
benchmarking the success of transition on different farms throughout Europe. The
participating farms were compared with each other for each question by their calculated
LOV’s. Factors which were associated with a better LOV were the occurrence of more
than 100 calvings per year versus less than 100 and the introduction of the heifers into
the lactating group versus the dry cow group. Other factors associated with a better
LOV, but based on a small group of farmers, were feeding one ration during dry off
versus two rations and taking milk reducing measures to all cows before drying off,
instead of some cows. In conclusion, a large number of calvings per year, the
introduction of heifers into the lactating herd, feeding a stable ration during the dry off
period and taking measures to reduce the milk production before dry off for all cows
might be success factors for the transition period. Now that a broad insight of the results
and their influence on transition has been gained, more extensive statistical models
should be set up and follow-up research should be carried out that zooms in on these
aspects."

The sample consisted of 530 young adults from Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria (Mage = 21.35; SDage = 2.07; 72.2% female) who were randomly assigned to one of three vignettes (i.e., autonomy-support, guilt-induction/low warmth, guilt-induction/high warmth). After reading the vignette, participants indicated the perceived parenting with respect to the vignette and their emotion regulation strategies in response to the vignette. Results showed that participants in the autonomy-supportive condition reported higher levels of perceived autonomy-support and warmth and lower levels of guilt-induction and emotion dysregulation than participants in both guilt-inducing conditions, with these two latter conditions not differing significantly with respect to both perceived parenting and emotion regulation. Current findings add to the growing literature on guilt-induction by showing that regardless of displayed parental warmth, guilt-induction has detrimental effects on individuals’ emotion regulation. Furthermore, given the key role of emotion dysregulation in ill-being, mental health services and counselling programs could even further try to consider the importance of maternal parenting practices for young adults’ emotion regulation capabilities"

Using a patient-centered approach has been proven to be beneficial. So, the aim of this pilot study is to determine the individual treatment goals of patients with SSD. Method. A concept mapping procedure was used. Nine participants with somatic symptoms were interviewed or filled in an online questionnaire. Forty-three individual treatment goals were obtained and a card sorting task was individually performed by eleven participants. Those results were then analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis. Results. Nine clusters were found and five overarching categories. Clusters included: Structured Life, Trigger Management, Overcoming Fear, Becoming Independent, Physical Improvement, Dealing with Invalidation, Acceptance, Enjoyment and Positive Mindset. Overarching categories were: Self-reliant, Skill Improvement, Acknowledgement, Fulfillment and Physical Improvement. Discussion. This study offers an encompassing overview of goals patients with SSD want to obtain in treatment. These differ from goals described by clinicians and despite its limitations, this study can be an indicator for a more patient-centered approach and be useful in shared decision making."

1) Welke informatie vullen klanten van De Contentkalender in bij de strategievelden? 
2) Welk van de ingevulde strategievelden gebruiken respondenten tijdens het dagelijkse werkproces?
a. Waarom gebruiken klanten sommige strategievelden wel en andere niet? 
b. Welke relaties zijn er tussen het wel of niet invullen van verschillende velden?
c. Beschouwen klanten de strategievelden als belangrijke toevoeging in de Contentkalender?

Ik begon met literatuuronderzoek om de elementen van een communicatiestrategie te achterhalen. Allereerst is een doelgroepanalyse de basis voor een goede communicatiestrategie (Michels, 2016; Newman, 2016; ’t Lam, 2000). Verder maken doelstellingen, mediakanalen en contentformaten onderdeel uit van een communicatiestrategie. In de Contentkalender kunnen gebruikers doelstellingen, doelgroepen, subdoelgroepen, mediakanalen en contentformaten formuleren. Deze worden in het huidige onderzoek de strategievelden genoemd.

Op basis van dit literatuuronderzoek stelde ik codes op voor een inhoudsanalyse op de invullingen van de strategievelden, zoals Contentkalendergebruikers die in de tool hebben toegevoegd. Uit de corpusanalyse blijkt dat mediakanalen door de meeste organisaties worden gebruikt, maar dat gebruikers niet hun eigen kanalen definiëren. De meest gebruikte mediakanalen staan al standaard in de Contentkalender. Het veld dat het meest wordt aangemaakt is contentformaat. Deze velden worden gemiddeld ook relatief rijk ingevuld. Echter, veel organisaties geven hun contentformaten de naam van een mediakanaal.

In een tweede deelstudie is een vragenlijst afgenomen. Het doel van de vragenlijst was om de relatie tussen de strategievelden te onderzoeken. De strategievelden die door de meeste respondenten worden gebruikt zijn mediakanalen, doelgroepen en contentformaten. Doelstellingen en subdoelgroepen worden het minst door respondenten gebruikt tijdens het dagelijkse werkproces. Uit vervolginterviews blijkt dat de respondenten aan het mediakanaal en/of contentformaat kunnen zien voor welke doelgroep een communicatie-uiting bedoeld is. Daarom is het invullen van een subdoelgroep overbodig.

Daarnaast wijzen de vervolginterviews erop dat een communicatiestrategie vooral leeft in de hoofden van werknemers. Er is vanuit de participanten geen dringende vraag om deze informatie in de kalender te integreren. Dat laat zien dat de invullingen in de Contentkalender niet altijd een goede representatie zijn van de mate waarop gebruikers strategisch over communiceren nadenken."
Current advances regarding CRISPR/Cas and its potential as a gene therapy for monogenic diseases,"['Griffioen, Merel']","['Janssen, Manoe']",2022-06-27T23:00:51Z,EN,"['CRISPR, Cas, gene therapy, monogenic disease, kidney disease']",Drug Innovation,"Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and the CRISPR-associated system (Cas) have been discovered around a decade ago, however since then it has slowly been developed into a gene editing tool. The improvements that have been made to the CRISPR/Cas system, allow for it to be used in both cells in a culture or directly in the body. One type of diseases that can be especially helped by further development of the CRISPR/Cas system, are monogenic diseases. These types of diseases are caused by a mutation in only one gene. Often, due to this mutation the function of the gene is lost as it is partly, or even completely missing. The fact that only one gene is affected, makes it a lot easier for the CRISPR/Cas system to fix. Recently, the number of CRISPR/Cas techniques that are available have increased and thus a growing number of mutations can be fixed. Besides the repair of a (partly) missing gene or the removal of a gene, now the editing of specific bases is, amongst others, also possible. Moreover, in this review the different techniques that have recently been developed for use in cultured cells and directly into animal models of monogenic diseases are discussed. From these studies, it can be seen that repair of mutated genes is often possible via CRISPR/Cas techniques. Moreover, some studies have even made it onto the clinical trial phases and are now being tested in humans. Preliminary results from these trials show great promise. Furthermore, we discuss the potential ways in which the discovered CRISPR/Cas techniques can be used for the treatment of monogenic kidney diseases, as currently no curative treatments are available and often a kidney transplant is needed. However, since the fact that repair of only one copy of the gene could already lead to disappearance of disease symptoms and thus present a clinical benefit for these patients, in theory, the success rate of gene repair in these monogenic kidney diseases could be high. Especially with the information from current studies, a lot of possibilities are available, which are briefly discussed in two examples. However, with use of the CRISPR/Cas system, also some limitations arise, such as how to get the system into the body and possible side-effects that can come along with this. Nevertheless, there are also options available which can overcome these limitations and improve the technique. When all this information is taken together, it is obvious that CRISPR/Cas is a powerful tool for gene editing. Yet, it is also obvious that the technique still needs to be improved and adapted before it can be, safely, used in humans. However, overall, CRISPR/Cas proves to be a realistic therapy for the treatment of monogenic diseases and could therefore benefit this group of patients."

Misstanden op het voetbalveld kunnen leiden tot minder spelplezier en zelfs mentaal letsel.
Eerdere onderzoeken naar het onvermeld blijven van misstanden op het wedstrijdformulier zijn vooral ingegaan op de factoren voor verenigingen om misstanden niet te melden. Dit is gek, omdat de clubscheidsrechter en niet de club, verantwoordelijk is voor zowel het geven van straffen bij incidenten als het melden van die incidenten bij de KNVB. De centrale onderzoeksvraag is dan ook: Op welke wijze leven clubscheidsrechters de opgestelde regelgeving van de KNVB in het senioren amateurvoetbal na? En welke motieven spelen daarin een rol? Door dit inzichtelijk te maken is een bijdrage geleverd aan de kennis op dit gebied van de relevante stakeholders binnen de beschreven context. Daarnaast zijn er beleidsvoorstellen gedaan om de naleving te verbeteren.
Om de centrale onderzoeksvraag te beantwoorden zijn semi-gestructureerde interviews afgenomen bij clubscheidsrechters. Door gebruik te maken van deze kwalitatieve onderzoeksmethode konden de clubscheidsrechters vragen op hun eigen manier interpreteren en werden sociaal wenselijke antwoorden zoveel mogelijk vermeden. Uiteindelijk zijn er elf interviews afgenomen bij clubscheidsrechters van acht verschillende verenigingen. 
De clubscheidsrechters zijn beschreven als front-line workers en zo zijn de antwoorden met betrekking tot discretionaire ruimte en naleving geanalyseerd en vervolgens geplaatst binnen de verschillende benaderingen van het kader van de ambtelijke rationaliteit. De ambtelijke rationaliteit is erg toepasbaar voor onderzoeken naar regeltoepassing. 
Uit de resultaten blijkt dat het merendeel van de clubscheidsrechters de grenzen opzoekt van de discretionaire ruimte. Ook heeft bijna de helft van de clubscheidsrechters niet alle rode kaarten altijd gemeld. De cultuur van een voetbalwedstrijd in de B-categorie, de administratieve druk en het gebrek aan anonimiteit van clubscheidsrechters zijn de voornaamste motieven om de regelgeving niet na te leven. 
Om de naleving van de regelgeving te verbeteren zijn verschillende aanbevelingen gegeven zoals een bewustwordingscampagne voor clubs en de clubscheidsrechters, een extra controle vanuit de teams en een manier om de anonimiteit te waarborgen."

the information contained in the data. Then, I feed these embeddings to an
opinion leader detection algorithm that is designed to use the information captured by the embeddings to create a ranking of users, with the highest-ranking
users being the designated opinion leaders. I compare these results with several
benchmarks of opinion leader detection methods that do not use graph embeddings. The quality of opinion leaders is similar for each method, though not all models designate the same users as opinion leaders. To conclude, I discuss
this research in the broader context of the field of graph embedding and opinion

Moreover, many Youth Health Care (YHC) practitioners, experienced persistent barriers in their care-delivery to parents of children with a Turkish or Moroccan migration background despite the growing effort to reduce it. Data on the first-hand YHC experiences of these parents are currently lacking.
Aims: We aimed to investigate how preventive care regarding to childhood overweight and obesity could meet the needs of these parents. Furthermore, we examined which social and cultural aspects in a YHC practitioner-parent communication were important for these parents. 
Methods: We obtained data of perspectives from these parents with a child with overweight or obesity and YHC practitioners. The audio data were transcribed into data verbatim which were than coded using NVivo.
Results: Three parents and four YHC practitioners were interviewed. A need-provision mismatch was observed and the following underlying needs of parents were identified regarding the encounter with a YHC practitioner: practical support in lifestyle challenges, awareness of the parents’ norms and values, support parents in managing everyday life with limited financial capacity, and attention to the impact of parent-child dynamic on the weight management. However, generic communication skills were believed to be the most effective strategic to bridge the mismatch.
Discussion: The YHC should shift to a holistic care-model that addresses parents’ underlying needs. Thus, family-oriented and weight-inclusive frameworks may provide innovative insights."

dynamically, during transitions between steady states. A recent study was able
to successfully describe the dynamics of protein sectors and the growth rate
under variation of the nutrient source. We derive a model of protein allocation
which can potentially describe steady-state and dynamical behaviour of groups
of protein and the growth rate, both in wildtype E. coli and the non-regulating
mutant. The central assumption is that E. coli maximises its growth rate. Our
model is able to capture steady state behaviour well, but fails in the dynam-
ical regime. We reveal the paradoxical role of product inhibition of catabolic
proteins, which within our framework is both required to predict steady state be-
haviour, but prevents accurate prediction of the dynamics of protein allocation.
In the future our framework could shed light on the link between production
inhibition and regulation in E. coli."

Relationships between the physical properties of Triassic sandstones in the West Netherlands Basin and short-wave infrared reflectance spectroscopy.,"['Brouwer, Mathijn']","['Niemeijer, André']",2022-06-08T23:01:07Z,EN,"['Short-Wave Infrared Reflectance (SWIR), spectroscopy, hyperspectral imaging, core logging']",Earth Structure and Dynamics,"Short-Wave Infrared Reflectance (SWIR) spectroscopy is a powerful and effective tool for identifying phyllosilicates, carbonates and other mineral groups. Hyperspectral imaging allows for quick, consistent and spatially continuous data analysis. This study investigates whether correlations between the hyperspectral data from short-wave infrared spectroscopy and the physical rock parameters, such as porosity, permeability and mineralogical composition, can be established. Hyperspectral image acquisition was performed from two cored intervals of Triassic sandstones in the West Netherlands Basin, the Naaldwijk-Geothermal (NLW-GT-01) and the Barendrecht-Ziedewij (BRTZ-01) borehole. The slabbed cores were specifically chosen due to their similar lithology yet significant difference in porosity and permeability values.
For each pixel (256 μm), the wavelength positions and depths of the three deepest absorption features in specified wavelength intervals were calculated. Calculations were generated with Hyperspectral Python software (HypPy3) and the wavelength mapping technique described by Van Ruitenbeek et al. (2014). These wavelength maps and other hyperspectral parameters that served as proxies were used for spectral algorithms to classify the pixels.
The results provided semi-quantitative mineral abundancy maps, detected compositional variation between equivalent minerals and successfully distinguished phyllosilicates, which other methods would not have been able to. However, non-hydroxylated minerals (e.g. silica, feldspar) are non-responsive within the SWIR region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The results advocate that the cored interval of the NLW-GT-01 was extracted from a higher metamorphic intensity zone and was subjected to more significant amounts of carbonate cementation than the BRTZ-01 core, both being mechanisms for porosity loss. The findings in this research are in accord with other studies that have examined the regional geology and/or these boreholes (e.g. De Hoo 2021; Maniar 2019; Ursem 2018; Koenen et al. 2013). Therefore this research concludes that SWIR spectroscopy is of added value to the current standard of core logging. However, the current methodology could not produce quantifiable parameters that correlate correctly with physical parameters. Future research should 1) produce larger hyperspectral datasets which could be directly linked to known physical properties, 2) investigate using a combination of multiple regions within the electromagnetic spectrum, and 3) the usability of this technique on core cuttings."
Patient-derived tumour models as predictor of treatment response in cancer patients: How precise is precision medicine?,"['Plas, Tim van der']","['Molenaar, Jan']",2022-06-08T23:01:01Z,EN,['Patient-derived tumour model; Precision medicine;'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Standard cut, poison and burn approaches to cancer treatment fail to save around 10 million patients every year across the globe. Precision medicine cancer treatment attempts to improve treatment by molecularly profiling a patient through (epi)genomics and transcriptomics to identify biomarkers in the patient's tumour. Personalized treatment is hence targeted towards these biomarkers for optimal patient care. While targeted treatment is more effective than non-targeted treatment, due to interand intratumour heterogeneity and clonal dynamics in a tumour, biomarker-targeted treatment often cannot treat a tumour completely. Combining drug candidates with patient-derived tumour models allow for sensitivity screening to assess drug efficacy before deciding on a treatment plan for an individual patient. In this literature review, five patient-derived tumour models applicable to precision medicine are discussed and compared. These include cell culture, tumour explants, mice or zebrafish xenograft transplantation and tumour organoids. The models are scored on several features regarding patient tumour representation, practicality of the model and drug screen effectiveness. Within these criteria, patient-derived organoids make a good case for suitability in a precision medicine context. Future improvements in co-culturing protocols and drug screen automation will further strengthen its position. Additionally, important considerations for drug screen study design, such as clear design and reporting guidelines and protocol standardization, will further improve the precision medicine approach to cancer treatment and allow for optimal individualized therapy."

Using a ceftriaxone plasma concentration cut-off value to identify ceftriaxone-related neurotoxicity in ICU patients: mission impossible?,"['Zeng, Wendy']","['Egberts, A.C.G.']",2022-06-08T23:00:50Z,EN,"['ceftriaxone, neurotoxicity, cephalosporin, critically ill patients, plasma concentrations']",Farmacie,"Abstract
Background: Ceftriaxone is a 3rd generation cephalosporin commonly used in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Little is known about the occurrence of ceftriaxone-related neurotoxicity (CRN) in this group of patients and its relation with the (free) ceftriaxone plasma trough concentration (Ctrough). The free fraction, which is able to distribute to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), may be increased in ICU patients due to highly variable pharmacokinetics. Patients and method: ICU patients, who received ceftriaxone and were at high risk of toxicity based on their plasma concentrations (total Ctrough > 100 mg/L and/or a free Ctrough > 10 mg/L), were identified from the DOLPHIN-database. Medical records were screened for symptoms of neurotoxicity and assessed for ceftriaxone causality. Potential cases were independently reassessed by a second reviewer prior to case inclusion. Results: From the 108 patients receiving ceftriaxone, 31 patients were at high risk of toxicity. We identified 2 cases of CRN presenting with myoclonus and non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), respectively. High total and free Ctrough were observed in the first case, whereas the second case only showed high free Ctrough. Conclusion: Identifying CRN in the ICU population is extremely challenging due to a multitude of confounding factors. Our findings suggest that Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of the free ceftriaxone Ctrough may aid in the diagnosis of CRN in ICU patients. Early recognition of CRN, in particular of ceftriaxone-induced NCSE, is of great importance as timely discontinuation may impact clinical outcomes."
"Perindopril starting dose errors in older adults in the Netherlands
A retrospective, cross-sectional, population-based study","['Cao, Yong Xin']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-06-08T23:00:49Z,EN,['Starting dose; adverse drug events; perindopril; prescribing; start-low-go-slow; older adults.'],Farmacie,"BACKGROUND: To abate the risk of adverse drug events and improve therapy compliance in older patients, the Dutch general practitioners’ community introduced the “start-low-go-slow”- principle for older adults in the Cardiovascular Risk Management guidelines in 2011. This advice implies that older patients should start an antihypertensive drug at the lowest available dose. It is unknown whether healthcare providers adhere to these guidelines and whether older patients genuinely start with the lowest dose in clinical practice. We aimed to investigate the difference between in-clinical practice prescribed and guideline recommended starting doses in older adults, using the antihypertensive drug perindopril as a proof of concept.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional, population-based study, using data from the Rotterdam Study. All patients aged 70 years and older with a recorded first perindopril prescription in the database between January 1, 1991, and February 8, 2021, were included. The mean starting dose (MSD) was calculated and compared to the guideline recommendation of 2 mg perindopril, using a one-sample t-test. A sub analysis was done to analyze the MSDs before and after 2011.

RESULTS: There were 1019 eligible patients. The overall mean starting dose of perindopril was 3.34 mg (SD ± 1.623 mg). The mean starting dose prescribed to older adults in clinical practice was significantly higher than the recommended 2 mg perindopril. The MSD between 1991 and 2010 was 3.44 mg (SD ± 1.506 mg). Between 2011 and 2020 a MSD of 3.23 mg (SD ± 1.749 mg) was found. Both mean starting doses differed significantly from the guideline recommendations. A significant difference in MSDs pre- and post-2011 was found as well (p = 0.0397).

CONCLUSION: A small decrease in mean starting dose of perindopril in older adults has occurred after the introduction of the start-low-go-slow-principle in 2011. However, healthcare providers do not adhere to the guidelines as they still prescribe higher starting doses of perindopril in older patients than recommended by the national cardiovascular risk management guidelines. More research should be conducted to find out whether this is justified."

Objective: To investigate how pharmacy technicians counsel patients who are prescribed opioids and which underlying barriers and facilitators determine their counseling behavior.
Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted. Interviews with 18 pharmacy technicians were collected, transcribed, and coded (NVivo). Based on the results, a questionnaire for pharmacy technicians was developed and distributed through social media and the PAM panel of pharmacy technicians. The questions addressed information provision, experiences, and perceptions regarding opioid use by patients. Descriptive analysis was performed, and associations were analyzed by a Chi- square test (p<0.05).
Results: 193 respondents were included in the analysis. At first opioid dispense, the majority of pharmacy technicians nearly always discussed the dosage and the common side effects. 44.5% (very) frequently distinguished information provision between opioid use for cancer and non-cancer-related pain. Insufficient knowledge about the indication (41.0%), not wanting to frighten (37.3%), and lacking patient compliance (48.7%) were noticed as barriers to discussing opioid dependence.
Although 91.2% of respondents thought discussing opioid dependence with patients is important, only 63.2% frequently discussed opioid dependence at first dispense.
Conclusion: About two-thirds of respondents (very) frequently discussed opioid dependence. Pharmacy technicians believed it is important to counsel patients on dependence, but experience barriers including patients not being open to receiving information, not wanting to frighten patients, and no availability of information on indications of the opioid."

representation of the Middle Eastern culture in the Aladdin (1992) animated film and its 2019 liveaction remake. Using an imagological approach, this research improves the understanding of how the
representation of the ‘other’ (i.e. hetero-image) might be used to generate and support a positive
representation of the ‘self’ (i.e. the auto-image) in Disney films that exclusively show the ‘other’. The
inquiry of this thesis is as follows: how are subtle distinctions in appearance, behaviour, and language
traits used to promote a favourable self-image to the Disney audience. In order to address the research
question, this research looks at how Arabic culture is portrayed in Disney's Aladdin where the heroes
are supposed to reflect ideals that the American spectator can identify with and distance themselves
away from the Middle East. Unlike other studies that have focused on the Arab as the ‘other’, this one
claims that the Arab is also the ‘self’. Therefore, this study employed a content analysis focusing on
the appearance, behaviour, values and language use of different characters in the two versions of
Aladdin. This research reveals that Disney has made a significant attempt in the linguistic and physical
features of its characters, but not in the behavioural and moral aspects of their films. The hetero-image
is maintained through the slight (residual) contrasts between the protagonists and supporting
characters."
Realizing The Potential Of Humic Acid In Norway Through Chitosan Treatment Of Drinking Water,"['Engels, Sophie']","['Appelman, Jaco']",2022-06-15T00:00:56Z,EN,['Circular economy; bio economy; humic acid; chitosan; coagulation; surface water treatment'],Bio Inspired Innovation,"The current movement towards a circular economy has increasingly focused on turning materials which were previously considered waste products into valuable resources. Humus materials, including humic acid, are potentially valuable resources that can be utilized from surface water treatment for use in agricultural applications to increase yield and remediate soil. Humic acid is commonly observed as color in surface water, and in Norway, is typically removed through coagulation with inorganic salt aluminum sulphate. Although this coagulation method has proven to be very cost-effective, has good performance, is relatively easy to handle and is highly available, it produces substantial amounts of alum sludge. Alum sludge contains a high concentration of alum and many other toxic compounds, like pathogens, organic contaminants and other heavy metals. To decrease the impact on both human health and the environment under current circumstances, there is a necessity to use a natural, more sustainable coagulant in water treatment processes. Chitosan is a natural substance that has been used successfully as a coagulant in water treatment and is a natural material made from the shells of crustaceans. Chitosan is biodegradable and poses no danger to human health and can be used to filter surface water to remove humic acid without contaminating it. This preserves the potential value of humic acid for use in agriculture as a soil amendment. In the result section of this paper, the resource availability of humic acid is mapped with data from all drinking water treatment plants to identify potentially rich sources of humic acid while a mass balance approach is used to determine how much humic acid can be potentially removed via chitosan. The results should be used to identify circular business opportunities which allow for humic acid to be brought back into the natural system and to understand where humic acid is occurring naturally in water sources in Norway and how it can be sustainably harvested."

resistance. Currently, multidrug resistant E. coli is the most frequent cause of lethal infections
among resistant bacteria in a hospital setting. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are commonly
spread via plasmids. From a clinical and epidemiological standpoint, it is very relevant to analyse the
plasmid content in E. coli. The rise of Illumina whole genome sequencing (WGS) has enabled fast
large-scale analysis of the genomic content of bacteria. However, it is usually not possible to
reconstruct plasmids by genome assembly of short-read sequencing data. Therefore, several
bioinformatic tools have been developed to uncover the total plasmid content in a sample, also
referred to as the plasmidome, by classifying genomic sequences as either chromosome- or plasmid-
derived. We benchmarked four of these binary classifiers (mlplasmids, PlaScope, Platon and
RFPlasmids). They are at the basis of plasmidEC, an ensemble classifier that combines the output of
three plasmid classifiers using a majority voting system. The combination of
Platon/PlaScope/RFPlasmid presented the best plasmidome predictions (F1-score = 0.904).
Compared to individual classifiers, plasmidEC achieved increased recall (0.885), especially for contigs
derived from ARG-plasmids (recall = 0.941). Moreover, a plasmidome study of E. coli ST131 using
plasmidEC was used to identify differences between this lineage and other E. coli. Finally, we show
that plasmidEC removes chromosomal contamination in plasmid reconstructions obtained by MOB-

This new method can provide insights into food consumption at fine spatial granularity, contributing to global health, diminishing world hunger, and providing opportunities for local production and consumption. This study explored whether we can use cross-modal analysis of images and ingredient sets to estimate relative ingredient proportions given images from a specific geographical area. These ingredient amounts are compared to relative consumption rates given by a translated dataset of retail sales of supermarkets within the same region. Specifically, the research focuses on Baku, Azerbaijan, as case study. To study consumption in this region, a new dataset is presented, AzerFSQFood, containing food images from eating establishments around the city. A pretrained cross-modal neural network (Li et al., 2020b) is applied to the novel image dataset, and the results are compared to a new translated supermarket sales dataset, based on an existing Azerbaijani dataset from supermarkets in Baku (Zeynalov, 2020). Unfortunately, the existing cross-modal neural network performs poorly on the AzerFSQFood dataset regarding ingredient detection and relative amount prediction. This indicates that existing cross-modal models are not yet readily applicable to novel datasets, and highlights the need of available models and curated datasets. The study in addition finds a significant correlation between Foursquare images and supermarket sales around Baku in terms of relative ingredient consumption."

Automated speech recognition has been used to generate a textual corpus of 20 episodes per year per show in the time period from 2011 until 2020.
In this research, bias is defined as the existence of prejudice towards certain (groups) of people. The (groups of) people this paper focuses on, are distinct in gender, male and female. A model calculating word distances (Word2Vec) was used to calculate the distance between words from six LIWC categories and two lists containing male or female related words.
Using linear regression, the change over time in gender bias in each LIWC category was calculated per year to show in what aspects gender bias has changed in these two television shows over the last decade.
Aside from the LIWC categories ‘Groom’ and ‘School’ in which a slight decrease in the slight bias towards women was found, no trend was found in the other categories. This could mean several things, for example 1) there is no trend in gender bias in these shows over the last decade, or 2) the corpus was of insufficient size to get proper results.
The limitations of this research make the research valuable as a steppingstone towards further research into the field of gender bias related to children’s television shows."

data on students’ perceptions were collected from an online survey and a focus group interview. The
results demonstrate that students do not follow a single pattern of language use in the combination
of lingua receptiva and English as a lingua franca contrary to the two separate modes. Students’
perceptions suggest that combining lingua receptiva and English as a lingua franca merges many
benefits and evades many challenges of the separate modes, which aligns with their preference of the
combination. Due to this effect regarding the benefits and challenges, the study concludes that lingua

zenuwstelsel. Jaarlijks krijgen ongeveer 30 kinderen in Nederland de diagnose neuroblastoom, waarbij 
de meeste kinderen jonger zijn dan zes jaar. De tumor komt voornamelijk voor in de bijnieren, maar 
kan ook ontstaan in de buik, borstholte, hals of het bekken. Bij de diagnose wordt aan de hand van 
het genetische profiel, de plaats en eventuele uitzaaiingen de risico groep bepaald. Patiënten die in 
de lage- en gemiddelde risicogroep vallen hebben een overlevingskans van ongeveer 90 tot 100%, 
terwijl patiënten in de hoge risicogroep een overlevingskans van minder dan 50% laten zien, ondanks 
intensieve therapie. Een afwijking in het ATRX-gen is een indicatie voor het plaatsen van de patiënt in 
de hoge risicogroep. De meeste van deze afwijkingen betreffen deleties van hele exonen. Het ATRX eiwit is onder andere betrokken bij het reguleren van genexpressie en stabiliteit van DNA doordat het 
de structuur van chromatine kan veranderen. Tevens wordt er in studies voorgesteld dat het ATRX eiwit ook een rol speelt in het oplossen van secundaire DNA structuren genaamd G-quadruplexen (G4) 
om replicatie stress te voorkomen. Deze structuren zijn rijk aan guanine en hebben de neiging om het 
DNA replicatie proces te onderbreken waarbij DNA schade ontstaat. Wanneer er in kankercellen ATRX mutaties optreden worden er meer G4 complexen teruggevonden, wat leidt tot meer DNA schade in 
deze cellen. Op dit moment zijn er beperkte therapieën beschikbaar voor neuroblastoom patiënten
met een ATRX-afwijking. In de afgelopen jaren zijn er een aantal nieuwe therapie opties gevonden 
voor deze specifieke groep, maar deze therapieën bleken niet erg effectief te zijn in ons lab. Hierdoor 
is het doel van dit project om specifieke en efficiënte compounds te identificeren voor de behandeling 
van ATRX neuroblastoom patiënten. In het verleden zijn modellen van de meest voorkomende ATRX 
deleties in patiënten nagemaakt in neuroblastoom cellen, zodat de gevoeligheid voor compounds 
vergeleken kan worden met neuroblastoom cellen die geen ATRX-deletie hebben. In deze studie 
hebben we eerst 199 compounds getest op neuroblastoom cellen met en zonder een ATRX-afwijking. 
Hierin vonden we vijf compounds die een resistentie lieten zien in ATRX modellen tegenover cellen 
met een normale ATRX status. Twee van deze compounds worden momenteel ook in de kliniek 
gebruikt voor de behandeling van neuroblastoom. Echter waren we opzoek naar compounds die juist 
gevoeliger werden in ATRX modellen. Nadat we geen specifieke compound voor ATRX konden 
identificeren, hebben we 12 compounds geselecteerd die aangrijpen op mechanismen waarvan 
bekend is dat ze veranderd zijn in neuroblastoom cellen met een ATRX-afwijking. Helaas vonden we 
ook hier geen specifieke compound voor ATRX, maar konden we wel drie compounds identificeren die 
effectief waren in alle geteste neuroblastoom cellen. Het combineren van compounds is gebruikelijk 
in de behandeling van kanker, waardoor we twee compounds hebben getest in combinatie met ruim 
200 compounds. Echter bleek dit niet genoeg voor een krachtige combinatie. Hieruit kunnen we 
concluderen dat we in deze studie drie compounds hebben gevonden die mogelijk interessant zijn

With the high demand for tissue and organ transplants, bioprinting is considered a promising tool to fulfil some of these needs. However, bioprinting is currently not routinely utilized in the clinic to produce transplantable tissues, and several issues have to be overcome to enable this. In this Review, we will first provide an overview of model design and printing techniques to give a better understanding of the printing factors to take into consideration.

Finally, we will discuss current advances made in tissue bioprinting, showcased by some innovative examples, and address challenges in biomaterials, cell biology, and engineering that have to be overcome to bring bioprinting closer to the clinic."
Van wat ik wil worden naar wie ik wil zijn.

Ze lijken door deze veranderde sociale context meer moeite te hebben met het ‘wat wil ik’-thema en bijbehorende vragen rondom werk en carriere. Conventionele, rationele manieren om met dit soort vragen om te gaan lijken onvoldoende de gewenste resultaten te geven. Dit arts-based onderzoek poogt daarom om met een focus op affect en tacit knowledge een meer intuïtieve benadering te nemen. In een onderzoekstraject dat bestond uit vier workshops en tussentijdse reflecties is onderzocht hoe zeven hoogopgeleide millennials (23 - 29 jaar) het proces van collages maken beleven in relatie tot de professionele aspecten van het ’wat wil ik’-thema. Voor de meeste deelnemers in dit onderzoek is het een bewustwordingsproces gebleken dat hun houding ten opzichte van het ‘wat wil ik’-thema heeft doen veranderen. Door meer ruimte te maken voor hun rechterhersenhelft, zijn ze zich meer bewust geworden van onverwoordbare kennis over zichzelf, die gevat kan zitten in intuïtieve, creatieve uitingen zoals collages. Het proces van collages maken en er direct intuïtief op reflecteren heeft er in drie fluïde fasen voor gezorgd dat men deze kennis als waardevol ging ervaren en een veelzijdiger beeld van hun ‘ik’ kon ontwikkelen en accepteren. Door dit proces nam het ervaren belang van het concreet beantwoorden van professionele ‘wat wil ik’-vragen wezenlijk af en ontstond er een houding met meer ruimte voor self-construction en water logic. Dit werd versterkt door de peer-to-peer context waarin het proces plaatsvond: de deelnemers kwamen gezamenlijk los uit het dominante maatschappelijke affective script en schreven samen een nieuw script, waarin acceptatie en rust rondom concepten als het ‘ik’ en ‘de toekomst’ heerst in plaats van onzekerheid, twijfel en frustratie. Dit onderzoek draagt daarnaast bij aan het academische debat rondom wat als wetenschappelijke kennis geldt.

It is long recognized that classical dynamical systems can be studied successfully via C*-algebras. A C*-action is a strongly continuous group homomorphism from a locally compact Hausdorff group to the automorphism group of a C*-algebra. The C*-actions involving the commutative C*-algebras precisely model the classical dynamical systems.

Every C*-action gives rise to a C*-algebra, called the crossed product, which encodes a lot of information about the C*-action. Using crossed products and duality theory for abelian locally compact Hausdorff groups one can develop a certain duality theory for C*-actions. Just as Pontryagin duality describes the second dual of a topological group, Takai duality describes the second dual of a C*-action. The idea is that one recovers a C*-action from its crossed product up to tensoring with another C*-action."

It is diagnosed in around 1 in 7 adults, and it is the leading cause of disability among elderly individuals. OA occurs frequently in the knee joint, causing pain, inflammation, swelling and, in its worse cases, reducing functionality. From imaging, it manifests as osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis, bone attrition, and asymmetric joint-space narrowing, leading to a unique shape of the bones. Currently no early biomarkers exist for this pathology, and pharmacological treatments only target symptoms, but not its cause. It has been proven that changes in bone shape can be found even more than one year prior to the onset of radiographic OA, and the joint space narrowing seems a good candidate to be used as biomarker. In order to properly visualize the joint space, however, imaging needs to be performed in a standing position. This is only possible in radiography (which provides 2D images) and not in 3D scan as Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Computed Tomography (which can provide an accurate 3D model of the joint). In this study, different ways to create statistical shape models that can provide accurate information on the anatomy of the knee joint under load are described, and currently registration involving 2D and 3D images seems to be the most suitable solution."

A recent, promising approach involves the use of formal argumentation to explain machine learning (ML) applications. In this thesis we investigate that approach; we aim to gain understanding of the value of argumentation for XAI. In particular, we explore how well argumentation can produce everyday explanations. Everyday explanations describe how humans explain in day to-day life and are claimed to be important for explaining decisions of AI systems to end-users. First, we conceptually show how argumentative explanations can be posed as everyday explanations. Afterward, we demonstrate that current argumentative explanation methods compute explanations that already contain some, but not all properties of everyday explanations. Finally, we present everyday argumentative explanations, or EVAX, which is a model-agnostic method that computes local explanations for ML models. These explanations can be adjusted in their size and retain high fidelity scores (an average of 0.95) on four different datasets and four different ML models. In addition, the explanations incorporate the main characteristics of everyday explanations and help in achieving the objectives of XAI."

Esto significa que el hablante multilingüe debe elegir qué lengua va a utilizar en distintas situaciones (McArthur, 1992). Además, el hablante puede tener diferentes motivaciones para utilizar una lengua. El contexto es un factor que puede determinar qué idioma se elige (Ramsden, 1979). De hecho, el comportamiento lingüístico del hablante es diferente en el ámbito académico que en el ámbito social (Babino y Stewart, 2016). Otro factor que puede afectar al uso de lenguas es la actitud que uno tiene hacia un idioma. Aunque investigaciones anteriores han demostrado las motivaciones existentes que tienen los alumnos bilingües para usar una determinada lengua en los dos ámbitos, faltan estudios que confirmen si estos son similares para los estudiantes multilingües. Tampoco investigan el rol de la actitud en la elección de una lengua por parte de los estudiantes. A través de un análisis de métodos mixtos, esta investigación examina en qué medida los estudiantes multilingües utilizan sus lenguas, si difiere según el contexto y si la actitud juega un rol en el uso lingüístico. Tanto las observaciones como los resultados del cuestionario mostraron que los estudiantes multilingües utilizan principalmente el inglés y la lengua de su especialización lingüística en el ámbito académico. También muestran que se habla la lengua materna principalmente en el ámbito social.

Annotating Deeply Embedded Languages,"['Helm, Robbert van der']","['McDonell, Trevor']",2022-06-14T00:00:42Z,EN,['Haskell;embedded languages;annotations;source mapping'],Computing Science,"A common problem with deeply embedded languages is that there is no strong connection between an embedded program, the abstract syntax tree for that embedded program, and a compiled version of the program. By gathering source location information for embedded expressions using a novel implicit parameter-based approach and annotating the embedded program's AST with this information, it becomes possible to map the embedded program back to the original source code. This new information can be used to improve compiler diagnostics, and to provide better profiling and debugging experiences for the language. In addition, the idea of extending that approach by also annotating the language with instructions for the compiler as a way to allow the programmer to hand optimize parts of a program will be explored. Storing these instructions as annotations on the abstract syntax trees enables new optimization workflows without requiring any changes to the language itself. Finally, an implementation of this annotation system in an existing language is examined, and its consequences on the experience of using the language are evaluated."
Using Active Learning to Mitigate Sampling Bias: a Comparison of Two Algorithms,"['Gathu, Hannah']","['Krempl, G.M.']",2022-06-14T00:00:40Z,EN,['machine learning; sampling bias; artificial intelligence; fairness; active learning; supervised learning; data; toxicology; RIVM'],Computing Science,"In machine learning we often have to work with imperfect data. One way in which data can be imperfect is through sampling bias. When a data sample is biased, it doesn't accurately represent the population. This makes it challenging to train a well-generalizing and unbiased classifier, which can cause a machine learning algorithm to be unfair. A lot of techniques have been produced to deal with this challenge. These vary from pre-processing techniques, which focus on mitigating bias in the data before beginning training, to in-process techniques, which alter the training process to reduce bias, to post-processing techniques. In this thesis we compare two active learning algorithms. One of them is an in-process technique that is specifically designed to target sampling bias. We compare this technique to a more conventional simpler active learning algorithm. Based on experiments on benchmark data, we compare how both algorithms perform in terms of improving the performance of the classifier, making the sample more closely resemble the “population” and other factors. We find that the conventional active learning algorithm actually seems to outperform  the sampling bias targeted algorithm on most judging criteria and for most settings. Besides that, we also do an experiment on biased toxicology data from the RijksInstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Mileu(RIVM)"

Firstly, it was examined how Ted - as an US-American - is represented, how he differs from the Brits and what this says about the respective national characters. A second analysis substantiated these results by looking into the way how Ted manages handling these cultural differences. The main result is, that even though Ted is distinguished from the British characters, the analysed series creates an atmosphere of unity in which cultural differences can be laughed about but not at people themselves. In combination with the representation of Ted as a strong, empathic and culturally intelligent leader, such series can be an opportunity to create awareness of the benefits and opportunities of cultural differences. Moreover, Ted Lasso is an example on how a comedy series can promote cultural intelligence and the associated skill set to educate people about this competence."

The study involved 520 cows from 8 Dutch dairy farms. The cows were visually scored on their locomotion (score 1-5) at four scoring moments: the beginning and end of the dry period, and in week 4 and 8 postpartum. All cows were equipped with two sensors, one leg-sensor and one neck-sensor, that measured daily eating time, number of eating bouts per day, duration per eating bout, daily lying time, number of lying bouts per day, duration per lying bout, daily ruminating time and number of steps. Locomotion groups 1 and 2 were grouped together as non-lame and were compared with locomotion groups 3, 4 and 5 (lame cows). Lame cows had shorter daily eating times and less eating bouts per day. Lame cows had longer daily lying times, longer lying bouts, slightly shorter daily rumination times and took fewer steps per day than non-lame cows, increasing with the degree of lameness. The prevalence of lameness was high during the transition period, especially in the early lactation, and increased over time. At 8 weeks postpartum, more than half of the cows (52,5%) were lame (locomotion score ≥ 3). This could lead to a reduced production, postpartum diseases, an extended calving interval and a higher culling rate. But above all, welfare of lame cows is affected. This indicates that there is much to be done in the field of claw health and farm management."

In total, 125 Dutch soldiers died during this violent conflict on the Korean peninsula, which was waged between the communist North Korea and American backed South Korea from 25 June 1950 to 27 July 1953. Existing literature reveals that the Dutch cabinet was not willing to participate in the Korean War, but eventually decided to send a battalion of volunteers and a total of 6 warships to Korea after pressure from the United States. The Dutch foreign policy was in a process of change from an independent course, based on colonial views, towards Atlanticism during this period. The Netherlands objected the US policy regarding the Korean War several times up to April 1951 and feared that its interests regarding Netherlands New Guinea would be harmed. The limited existing literature state that the Netherlands almost completely withdrew from the Korean question after this period and mostly followed the Atlanticist course of the US. Nevertheless, the war dragged on for 2 more years and Dutch troops stayed in Korea to January 1955, but no thorough research has been conducted about this period. Therefore, the following research question was analysed: How did Dutch policy regarding the Korean War from 9 April 1951 to 24 January 1955 reflect a change in orientation in its foreign and defense policies? The Dutch policy regarding the Korean War could indeed be considered as an expression of a change in its orientation in foreign and defense policies during this period. The Netherlands did confront the Americans several times regarding its Korean War policy, Dutch diplomats did not completely stay aloof and the Netherlands interest in Asia also played a role to shape the actions and reactions of the Dutch cabinet and diplomats from April 1951 to January 1955. So, the Asian perspective was still present, while the Dutch cabinet and diplomats followed the Atlantic course more deliberately after April 1951."

This study aims to determine whether high dimensional graph embeddings can be used to uncover structures in graphs, and visualize these in two dimensional matrices. We propose a framework that embeds a graph in high dimensions; calculates the pairwise distance matrix; reorders rows and columns in this matrix; and visualizes the original graph in a new matrix exploration tool. The goal of this framework is to supply individuals with high level knowledge on relational data. We test the framework by analyzing visual quality by feeding in basic pre-generated graphs. The random walk algorithms (e.g. DeepWalk, Walkets and attentionWalk) are able to accurately visualize 4 out of 6 of the canonical data patterns for a high level understanding of the data. Nevertheless, these basic graphs do not reflect complex relational data used in many real world applications, and therefore, we introduce two novel algorithms for embedding numerical node-attributed graphs (i.e. featPMI and featWalk). These algorithms are tested on a subset of the attributed Slovakian social network Pokec, in which both the algorithms show increasing information retention over the naive embedding of DeepWalk. Furthermore, featWalk is found to be preferred over featPMI with a clearer separation of patterns, and better feature preservation. Our findings indicate the potentiality of embeddings to generate valuable high level matrix visualizations."

When the reward function is not straightforward to define, a surrogate reward function might be helpful. A surrogate reward function is defined by using the Fiedler vector of the Laplacian of the graph defined by the game. Laplacians based on weighted graphs in four different ways are defined and used to make different surrogate reward functions for a walking game. Finally, the surrogate reward functions are used in a value iterations algorithm and compared to the exact value function of the walking game."

Lo studio ha approfondito il modo in cui i madrelingua inglesi negli U.S. considerano il loro monolinguismo per contribuire alle idee su come l’ideologia monolingue degli U.S.si è manifestata e come ha influenzato il paese e la sua gente. 

Per testare l’ipotesi che l’ELF è un vantaggio in quanto fornisce un mezzo di comunicazione per la popolazione mondiale e che gli americani considerano il loro monolinguismo in relazione all’ascesa dell’ELF, è stato adottato un approccio etnografico qualitativo conducendo interviste semi-strutturate con cinque intervistati americani e cinque italiani. Le risposte sono state analizzate attraverso un approccio tematico all’analisi dei dati qualitativi. I risultati hanno esemplificato che entrambi i gruppi di partecipanti percepiscono l’ELF come benefico nel fornire al mondo una lingua comune per comunicare, ma percepiscono come la lingua si sia diffusa con mezzi diversi. In generale, gli americani considerano il loro monolinguismo legato a un’inibizione della motivazione dell’apprendimento delle lingue a causa dell’aumento dell’ELF e del prestigio che riveste l’essere madrelingua. 

Questi risultati indicano che l’ELF aiuta a facilitare le interazioni interculturali fornendo un ponte verso un mezzo di comunicazione di massa tra le popolazioni del mondo. Su questa base, l’ELF dovrebbe essere considerato in tutti i contesti comunicativi interculturali."

Thus, there remains a need for novel therapies that result in a better quality-of-life after
treatment. The tumor microenvironment (TME) affects tumor proliferation and progression.
Interactions between tumor cells and their TME are being targeted as novel treatment options.
A well-known inhibitory interaction in HL is PD-1 mediated inhibition of cytotoxic T-cell activity,
which renders the immune system in the TME inactive and lets Hodgkin cancer cells escape
immune detection. To study HL TME composition in pediatric patients, samples were
analysed on a single cell level. A T-cell dominant TME marked with exhaustion markers
CTLA4 and LAG3 was identified. Tumor cells were identified for seven out of eight patients
using a SORT-seq strategy. Interactions between tumor cells and their TME were studied with
CellChat, a method that reconstructs cell-cell interaction by computing a probability score
based on scRNA-seq data. Finally, identified interactions were compared to previously
published results. Both similarities and discrepancies were found, indicating that there is a
likely biological difference between published Hodgkin protein data focussing on adults and

Prevalence and impact of SARS-CoV-2 viral respiratory co-infections on disease severity in children and adults,"['Meglič, Eva']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-07-01T00:00:34Z,EN,[],Epidemiology,"ABSTRACT
Introduction: The burden of SARS-CoV-2 has been widely recognized. However, it is not yet fully known whether a co-infection with another viral respiratory pathogen influences disease severity, mortality and length of hospital stay. Therefore, this paper aims to gather information on the impact of SARS-Cov-2 on disease severity and mortality, while also having a co-infection in both, children and adults.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Medline, PLOS Journals, Willey Online Library and bioRxiv, to retrieve all relevant English papers. Studies that assessed the co-infection between SARS-CoV-2 and another respiratory pathogen and additionally also reported on disease severity, hospitalization or mortality were included.
Results: Ultimately, 22 studies have been included in this review. In total 1593 (5%) cases of co- infection have been reported among 32,383 patients. We identified ten different respiratory pathogens that caused co-infection. The mortality rate among co-infected patients was 9% and the reported time of hospitalization varied between 6.9-20 days.
Conclusion: In conclusion, our analysis showed conflicting results regarding the co-infection and its effect on disease severity. The presence of co-infection showed increased risk of severe illness, mortality and hospitalization in some studies and in other studies we did not observe that. The findings in this study support the need for diagnostic testing to identify and treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 co- infection."

Drug safety analysis - no sex differences in denosumab,"['Codrington, Mickado']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-07-09T00:00:32Z,EN,['denosumab; safety; sex differences; data visualization; statistical analysis; drug safety analysis'],Biology of Disease,"Introduction: Advocacy groups claim that women are underrepresented in medical research, resulting in unsafe treatments. Osteoporosis is a chronic disease that causes bone fragility and risk of fractures and occurs predominantly in women. Denosumab is investigated for osteoporosis treatment separately in men and women, resulting in much sex-specific data. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the treatment is equally safe for both sexes. The objective of this research is to evaluate potential sex differences in the safety profile of denosumab. In a broader scope, we aim to formulate a methodology for sex-specific safety analysis, transcending denosumab and becoming applicable to other medicines and subpopulations.
Methods: We compared 4 groups (men and women, each with denosumab and control (placebo) treatments). There is no golden standard for the assessment of differences in safety of a medicine between the sexes, because gender differences are known to occur in control treatment, hampering the interpretation of denosumab data. Adverse event (AE) data from representative studies on denosumab were retrieved from public sources and the Dutch regulatory authority’s database. Visual summaries were made for exploration of adverse event profiles, followed by statistical analysis by Fisher’s Exact test, meta-analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
Results: Publicly available data lacked detail for these analyses. The regulatory authority database provided workable data from 8558 females and 1927 males for analysis. Analyses detected similar safety signals that concern sex differences in the incidence of serious adverse events under denosumab and control treatment (example: Musculoskeletal disorders, relative risk (RR) of men vs. women in control arm = 0.48 (Fisher’s Exact p-value = 0.03), RR in denosumab arm =0.43 (p = 0.013). In none of the system organ classes was serious adverse event incidence affected by both sex and treatment (example: Musculoskeletal, logistic regression: sex [Male] x treatment[denosumab] p =0.824). We constructed a new plot: the2 factor efficacy and safety scatter (2FES2), enabling identification of sex differences, treatment differences and those sex differences that are attributable to denosumab.
Conclusion: Statistical analysis of representative studies does not reveal important sex differences that are attributable to the presence of denosumab. Publicly available safety data from e.g., literature, and national and European assessment reports are insufficient for sex-specific safety assessment. The newly constructed 2FES2 uses data visualization, substantiated by logistic regression. This aids in the exploration, comparison and comprehensible reporting of safety profiles, detecting sex-specific safety signals. This method could be applied to assess other safety parameters such as discontinuations, or other medicines."
Investigating the Influence of Pesticide Exposure on the Human Gut Microbiome,"['Cornu Hewitt, Beatrice']","['Huss, Anke']",2022-07-09T00:00:37Z,EN,"['Pesticides, gut microbiome, occupational exposure, organic farming.']",Epidemiology,"Background: Pesticides are widely used in the agricultural industry and can cause unintentional harm to non-target organisms, including humans. The public health effects of exposure to pesticides have been widely examined, however impacts on the human gut microbiome have been rarely investigated. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been linked with many disease states and could have critical associations with the adverse health effects observed following pesticide exposure. Experimental animal studies have shown significant alterations of the microbial structure following both short-term and long-term exposure to pesticides but further studies are required to clarify the microbial effects in humans.

Objectives: Our primary aim is to determine whether personal exposure measurements reflecting short- and medium-term pesticide exposure are linked with structural alterations of the human gut microbiome. Additionally, we aim to investigate the impacts of long-term pesticide exposure on microbial structure by comparing the gut microbiomes of organic and non-organic farmers.

Methods: Short-term pesticide exposure will be defined and quantified using measured urine concentrations of five specific pesticide metabolites. Proxies of medium-term pesticide exposure include analysis of compounds adsorbed by silicone wristbands worn by participants and analysis of participant hair samples. Non-organic farmers will represent individuals with long-term pesticide exposure. To explore the impacts of short-, medium- and long-term pesticide exposures on the gut microbial structure, we will inspect different characteristics of the microbiome. Alpha and beta diversity will be explored in relation to pesticide exposures and we will also determine whether there are specific differentially abundant bacterial species in relation to pesticide exposure using differential abundance analysis.

Expectations and applicability of results: As a result of pesticide exposure, we expect to find significant alterations in the gut microbial structure. By elucidating possible pesticide-induced gut microbial alterations, we hope to determine whether the gut microbiome should be a target of interest to investigate in future safety assessments of pesticides. By investigating the effects of different exposure durations, we will be able to identify individuals at greatest risk, which may drive the development of additional exposure prevention strategies."

However, evaluating the quality of these embeddings is a challenge, given the lack of annotated resources for medical Dutch. The second part of the thesis presents experiments using a novel domain adaptation method, Domain Adversarial Neural Networks, which is getting attention for domain-adaptation problems in NLP. The network is trained on a Named Entity Recognition task and a Part-of-Speech tagging task, with and without (English) medical embeddings. Its performance and suitability for various domain-adaptation scenarios is evaluated."

RIsk Management for Heat Stress and Pluvial Flooding in the Centrumgebied of Utrecht Science Park,"['McDevitt, Tom']","['Jong, Steven de']",2022-04-09T00:00:40Z,EN,['Risk mapping; natural hazards; heat stress; flooding; climate adaption and resilience; nature based solutions; technical solutions; social solutions.'],Earth Surface and Water,"The Gebiedsontwikkeling (GBO) team at Utrecht University are re-developing the centrumgebied of Utrecht Science Park with the ambition to provide a safe environment for users in the face of climate change. Climate change will most likely lead to an intensification of natural hazard severity and frequency, thereby enhancing the likelihood of disaster – the loss of life, injury, or destroyed and damaged assets. Therefore, understanding and mapping the risks presented by a changing climate is prudent.

Risk mapping is the evaluation of (natural) hazards and the exposure and vulnerability of a location and population to that hazard. Risk mapping was undertaken evaluating two hazards; heat stress and pluvial flooding across two severity scenarios. Exposure and vulnerability of the centrumgebied and its elements (i.e. population, buildings, land-use) was calculated using a multi-criteria analysis of key impact elements and their characteristics. Population vulnerability was evaluated for three scenarios, demonstrating to decision makers that this component dynamic, not static.

Merging the heat stress and flooding risk maps commonalities where maximal risk occur were identified, namely along transport infrastructure, vegetation and large areas of impermeable street surfaces. These locations of elevated risk provide GBO decision makers with a list of priority areas to focus redevelopment strategies and to plan suitable adaption and resilience measures into their designs.
To evaluate which adaption measures are most effective and suitable for the Centrumgebied, the Climate Resilience City toolbox / Klimaatbestendige Stad Toolbox (KBS) was used. This toolbox is an open source online software used to evaluate climate adaptation measures - both technical and nature based - to heat stress, drought and flooding. Using this tool, it was possible to map various scenarios onto the centrumgebied, both independently and with GBO stakeholders.

Measures were evaluated using a cost benefit analysis of relevant metrics relating to heat stress and flooding, revealing that adding trees to the city scape was the most effective measure against both hazards. Thereafter, the best nature based solutions were adding bioswales and rainwater detention ponds. The best technical solutions were green roofs with drainage delay, hollow roads and permeable pavements. Social Solutions, although unable to be mapped on the KBS toolbox, can have wide-spread impacts on how natural hazards are manifest into risk. Ensuring the local population is willing, informed and engaged with climate adaptation strategies is essential to ensure their efficacy. Living Labs have been identified as a methodology that involves diverse stakeholders in any given adaptation project. In this sense, Living Labs can tie together nature-based, technical and social solutions in an integrated form. Further, there is a need to test the effectiveness of each proposed measure and any possible co-benefits that may arise. The Living Lab methodology could do so with stakeholder co-creation, meanwhile addressing user values, behaviours and practices.

Follow up research evaluating how the proposed 2050 land-use design will impact the form of flooding and heat stress would provide valuable insight into how risk will manifest in the future vision. Testing measures from the KBS toolbox on this land-use design will provide a valuable comparison to this study. Finally, researching un-intended consequences and strategies to diversify the risk portfolio of GBO is necessary to ensure the campus is resilient to the impacts of future climate change."
Effects of climate change on the welfare of livestock,"['Veer, Mariska']","['Rodenburg, Bas']",2022-04-13T00:00:30Z,EN,['Klimaatverandering; Welzijn; Effecten; Heat stress; Vee; Stijgende temperaturen'],Environmental Biology,"Wereldwijd stijgt de temperatuur door verhoogde uitstoot van broeikasgassen door menselijke activiteiten. Klimaatvoorspellingen wijzen op stijgende temperaturen, meer extreme weergebeurtenissen in de toekomst en veranderende klimaten. Hoewel de effecten van klimaatverandering op mensen flink onderzocht is, zijn de effecten op het welzijn van gehouden dieren veel minder onderzocht. Goed welzijn wordt beschreven op verschillende manieren, waar vooral gekeken wordt naar de gezondheid en het natuurlijk functioneren van een dier. In dit artikel wordt gekeken naar het effect van klimaatverandering op zes principes die goed welzijn van vee aanduiden: 1) erkenning van intrinsieke waarde en integriteit, 2) goede voeding, 3) goede omgeving, 4) goede gezondheid, 5) natuurlijk gedrag en 6) positieve emotionele toestand. 
	Klimaatverandering heeft twee grote negatieve gevolgen: stijgende temperaturen en meer extreme weergebeurtenissen zoals overstromingen, langdurige droogte en stormen. Deze gevolgen van klimaatverandering hebben een negatief effect of het welzijn en tasten de meeste van de welzijn-principes negatief aan. Enige uitzondering is de erkenning van intrinsieke waarde en integriteit van dieren. Door de negatieve effecten van klimaatverandering zal de intrinsieke waarde en integriteit van gehouden dieren belangrijker worden en sneller worden besproken tijdens discussies. Maar verder worden de andere principes negatief beïnvloed door klimaatverandering. Zo kan het voedsel van de dieren worden verwoest door extreme weergebeurtenissen, en de waterkwaliteit verslechteren. Tevens kunnen de dieren niet goed tegen hogere temperaturen, omdat ze dan buiten hun thermo neutrale zone raken en hun warmte niet meer kwijt kunnen. Ze zullen vervolgens actief ander gedrag moeten vertonen om toch te proberen de warmte kwijt te raken. Sommige dieren in koudere regio’s zullen iets profiteren van de minder strenge winters, maar de meeste dieren zullen meer last ervaren van de hitte dan profijt van de minder strenge winters. Daardoor hebben hogere temperaturen een negatief effect op de omgeving, gezondheid en het natuurlijk gedrag van de dieren. Als deze principes allemaal negatief worden beïnvloed door klimaatverandering, zal de emotionele toestand van het dier ook negatiever worden.
	Aangezien klimaatverandering een probleem is dat al gaande is, zullen maatregelen tegen klimaatverandering voortaan ook manieren moeten bevatten om het welzijn van de dieren te beschermen tegen de negatieve effecten. Mogelijke oplossingen om goed welzijn te behouden zijn het wisselen naar diersoorten die beter tegen hitte kunnen, het aanpassen van schuren met nieuwe koeltechnieken en zorgen voor meer schaduw en schuilplekken in weilanden. Een aanbeveling om het welzijn te behouden, is om de dieren een meer gevarieerde omgeving aan te bieden. Hierdoor kunnen ze zelf gedragsmatige aanpassingen doen om te kunnen omgaan met klimaatverandering en zelf beslissen in wat voor omgeving ze hun tijd willen besteden."
The inheritance of coat colours and patterns in the Dutch Landrace Goat,"['Zwiep, Wiona']","['Nielen, Mirjam']",2022-04-09T00:00:41Z,EN,"[""Dutch Landrace; Goat; Coat colours; Colour patterns; Pedigree data; Inheritance; Black; Brown; Dorsal stripe; Phenotype; White Markings; Piebald; Multicoloured; Agouti; Extension; Loci; CNV's;""]",Gezondheidszorg landbouwhuisdieren en vet. volksgezondheid,"In the last decades, the Dutch Landrace goat has successfully been re-established in the Netherlands. 
This involved crossing in exotic breeds and with that losing the authentic genetic diversity. The goal 
of the LFNL is to conserve the Dutch Landrace goat and all its colours and patterns. This research has 
shown that over the years, the amount of colour combinations grew, creating a larger diversity of 
combinations. When looking at the proportions of colours, some colours percentwise occur more or 
less in the population over the years. To make certain phenotypes more prevalent in the population, 
the goat's genetic characteristics can be looked at. In this research pedigree data suggests a recessive 
black and a dominant brown pigment type within the Dutch Landrace. As for the two pattern types, 
the characteristic dorsal stripe pattern shows mostly dominant inheritance, but the white markings 
inherit in a more complicated way. This information can be compared to research that already was 
performed in goats. As previous research suggests, multiple loci, i.e., Agouti, Extension, TYRP1, 
EDNRA and KIT, are involved with the inheritance of goat phenotypes. To find out which CNVS are 
present on which loci, further research is necessary. After that, a choice can be made when crossing 
in breeds that are known to dominantly inherit certain phenotypes."

However, men and women display BD differently, and it is thus possible that certain determinants have varying influences on BD, depending on gender. This paper investigated the associations between intolerance of uncertainty, interoceptive awareness and male and female BD. A cross-sectional correlational research design was employed, and participants (n =171) completed questionnaires measuring the variables. Two mediation analyses were conducted, with IA mediating the association between IU and male and female BD. A total and direct effect of IU on female BD was found. IA mediated this relation. For males, no significant effects were found. Exploratory analyses revealed a positive association between IU and the subscale Low Body Fat for males. Findings underline the importance of studying gender differences in BD to enhance treatment options. Determinants of BD seem to differ in males and females. Interestingly, the desire for a skinny body seems to be important for both genders."
Investigating the effect of visual aids in working with preventive healthcare data,"['Haenen, Koen']","['Dimara, Evanthia']",2022-04-13T00:00:37Z,EN,[],Human-Computer Interaction,"In the preventive healthcare sector, enormous amounts of data are collected and stored in digital health records, resulting in information overload for users of such systems. Too little priority is given to the way this information is presented to the user. This study aimed to investigate to what extent visual aids in the form of colours, icons, and metaphors can be applied to the preventive healthcare sector, and what their effect is on the cognitive load of the user and the usability of digital health records. A case study was conducted at Topicus, for which two interfaces were designed, based on exploratory interviews with 7 youth nurses and youth doctors. Both designs present the most important data about parents as elicited from the interviews, but in different ways. One design was a baseline version of a parent record, the other was a version with added visual aids. Then, a between-subject experiment was conducted in which 32 participants performed tasks with either the baseline version or the version with visual aids. Afterwards, they filled in an adjusted 5-item NASA - Task Load Index questionnaire, which is a questionnaire often used to measure cognitive load during tasks. Then, they filled in an adjusted 9-item System Usability Scale questionnaire, which is an effective questionnaire often used to measure perceived usability. No conclusive result was found, only a slight trend indicating decreased cognitive load and increased usability when applying visual aids. Furthermore, it was found that colours and icons are preferred over textual information, but that it is hard to apply such interventions in the preventive healthcare sector due to its unstructured and textual data types. Lastly, participants had mixed reactions with regards to metaphors and the number of visualisations used in one screen. Future studies are needed to test different types of visual aids as well as  to consider additional metrics such as time, interaction logs and accuracy to better support the healthcare sector on information overload."
Investigating Best Factor Model Fit for the EDE-Q Among Dutch Patients Suffering from Binge Eating Disorder,"['Özer, Yağmur Irmak']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-04-13T00:00:38Z,EN,['Binge Eating Disorder; Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire; Confirmatory Factor Analysis; Factor Structure'],Clinical Psychology,"Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) is considered to be a practical alternative to the Eating Disorder Examination Interview. However, its factor structure is based purely on theoretical grounds. Empirical research has failed to replicate the original four factor model of EDE-Q, consisting of dietary restraint, eating concern, shape concern, and weight concern. Consequently, different factor structures have been suggested and tested. Only one study to this date has examined the factor structure of EDE-Q on a Dutch sample diagnosed with binge eating disorder. This paper aims to examine the factor structure of eating disorder examination questionnaire on a sample of Dutch patients with binge eating disorder (N= 256). Best model fit was analyzed via confirmatory factor analysis. None of the proposed factor structures were an exact fit for this sample. The brief one factor model consisting of 8 items and measuring eating disorder pathology in general was found to be the best fitting model. These results implicate that EDE-Q only measures general eating disorder pathology, and not the specific facets of eating disorders. Further research is recommended to consider the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and gender differences in eating disorders on measurements of eating disorders, and to create a more psychometrically sound measurement tool to assess specific eating disorder facets or include additional materials to measure other aspects of eating disorder pathology."

Een voor leesmotivatie, waarin onderscheid is gemaakt tussen intrinsieke en extrinsieke leesmotivatie, een voor leesfrequentie, waarin er is gevraagd naar het leesgedrag van leerlingen, en een auteurherkenningslijst met 50 namen van bestaande en niet-bestaande auteurs, waarbij leerlingen moesten aangeven of zij de auteurs kenden en of ze al eens een boek van de auteurs hadden gelezen. Daarnaast maakten de leerlingen een tekstbegriptoets: een voor de eersteklassers en een voor de vierdeklassers. 
	De resultaten laten zien dat intrinsieke leesmotivatie een significante voorspeller is voor betere leesvaardigheid bij eersteklassers, mavoleerlingen en vwo-leerlingen; leerlingen die vanuit hun eigen motivatie boeken lezen, halen hogere tekstbegripscores. Extrinsieke leesmotivatie blijkt geen voorspeller. Daarnaast laten de resultaten zien dat leesfrequentie een significante voorspeller is voor een goede leesvaardigheid bij eersteklassers, vierdeklassers en vwo-leerlingen; leerlingen die veel lezen, halen hogere tekstbegripscores. Verder blijkt dat voor eersteklassers het lezen van andere teksten, zoals tijdschriften, digitale teksten en stripboeken, een voorspeller was voor tekstbegrip.
	Leerlingen moeten dus vanuit hun eigen motivatie boeken willen lezen. Dat kan worden bereikt door leerlingen keuzemogelijkheid aan te bieden en de betrokkenheid bij leesteksten te vergroten. Het is dus nog altijd zinvol om te investeren in leesbevorderingsprogramma’s."
The Protective Role of Adaptive Humor Styles in Depression: A Culturally Diverse Study,"['Mohamad, Nora']","['Doosje, Sibe']",2022-04-13T00:00:34Z,EN,['Humor Styles; Depression; Cultural Orientation; Collectivism'],Clinical Psychology,"This paper aimed at exploring the role of adaptive humor styles and personal-level collectivism in depression in a cross-cultural context. It was hypothesized that both adaptive humor styles would be negatively associated with depression and positively with personal- level collectivism, which would also be negatively associated with depression. Using online versions of the short Humor Style Questionnaire (HSQ), the Individualism-Collectivism Scale (ICS), and the Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI), a total of 650 self-report responses were examined. Subjects’ age ranged between 18 - 65 years (M = 33.4, SD = 12.5), with 58% females, 41% males, and less than 1% of other gender and a relatively heterogeneous distribution of educational levels. As hypothesized, the self-enhancing humor style and personal-level collectivism were negatively associated with depression. Unexpectedly, the affiliative humor style was not. Both adaptive humor styles were positively correlated with personal-level collectivism, as expected. Further, personal-level collectivism partially explained the negative relationship between the self-enhancing humor style and depression. The affiliative humor style in interaction with the self-enhancing humor style, however, diminished the protective role the self-enhancing humor style had on depression. Overall, despite some methodological limitations, findings suggest a protective role of the self- enhancing humor style and personal-level collectivism in depression. An important implication is the encouragement of clients’ self-enhancing humor style and collectivistic values in clinical interventions for depression."

Visualising boundary disputed on the map objectively?,"['Mosch, Guido']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-04-21T00:00:28Z,EN,['Uncertainty Visualistion; Disputed Boundaries; Objective; Jagged Line; Hatching; Transparency; Atlas; Boundaries'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"Territorial disputes and conflicts still define today’s news headlines. As of February 22, 2022, Russia
recognises two self-proclaimed independent states that the rest of the world considers to be part of
Ukraine. The situation of Luhansk and Donetsk show that the world is still as geopolitically tense as
ever. Cartographers get tasked with visualising the area from different perspectives. One perspective
prescribes to visualise the areas as two new countries, whereas another perspective prescribes to
show the two areas as part of Ukraine, but with something going on to inform viewers on the current
situation. This only shows how relevant the work of a cartographer is, still today. The visualisations
determine how people from different parts of the world view the areas from different perspectives.
How to visualise these disputed territories, as well as other disputed boundaries, is what the goal of
this research is. However, the goal of this research is not to do it from different perspectives, but to
visualise the disputed boundaries as objective as possible. To do so, this research aims to answer the
following research question: “How can geopolitically disputed boundaries be visualised as objective
as possible on a map?”

To answer this research question, a theoretic framework on geopolitically disputed boundaries had
been created. Here, the distinction between two types of disputed boundaries had been made. On
one hand, disputed boundaries can exist as two states do not agree on the location of it. On the
other hand, disputed boundaries can exist as one or more states do not recognise the boundaries of
another, self-proclaimed independent state, and view the boundaries as illegitimate. Following this
an extensive analysis of atlases and online map environments have been performed to gather insight
on the current visualisations of disputed boundaries. Based on this and on existing literature on
uncertainty visualisation, different visualisations have been created in a web application to discuss
during expert interviews. These experts have been selected on their knowledge and experience with
cartography. Some experts had direct involvement with disputed boundaries or the visualisation of
those.

Based on the analysis of atlases, online map environments, uncertainty visualisation methods and
the interviews, it is found that colour hue and polyline shape improve the map readability. Colour
hue should be applied to show the claims of different countries. The shape of polylines should be
used to define whether an accepted or disputed boundary can be seen. Moreover, it is found that
transparency is the best fitting option for claims in maritime areas, especially in the South China Sea
where 7 parties are involved. Having maritime claims as transparent layers helps pinpoint each of the
claimed areas. For disputes between two countries over larger areas, it has been found that hatching
is still the best suitable visualisation method, as viewed by the experts. Using colours for hatches
makes the map understandable in a one-eye view, which is deemed an important factor of map
readability. A final recommendation is made on the jagged line technique, which would require more
testing with non-experts to verify the understandability and suitability of it. The jagged line technique
should be combined with polyline shapes to signify its disputed status."
Simulating urban growth and its impact on the potential crop production of a coastal area in Greece,"['Konstantinidis, Georgios']","['Lammeren, Ron van']",2022-04-20T23:00:42Z,EN,"['Urban-growth-modelling, SLEUTH, Cellular-Automata scenario-based modelling, peri-urban agriculture, crop production, food security, Geographic Information Systems, regional planning, urban planning']",Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"Peri-urban space and agricultural activities have proven to be critical in supplying urban population with healthy and proximate food. The special characteristics of peri-urban areas are a challenging parameter to consider when it comes to planning policies and strategies. As urban growth has historically proven to affect agricultural peri-urban areas it is important to assess its potential impacts and evaluate certain policies and plans.
Scenario-based, urban growth simulation models are widely used to test policies and plans for exploring potential impacts of future changes. Cellular Automata (CA) models are popular amongst others in modelling urban growth and land use and landcover changes, due to their ability to mimic complex real-world phenomena and interactions in an inherently spatial manner with simplicity and controllability. Furthermore, they are commonly used with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) data This study uses the SLEUTH urban growth model (UGM) to simulate urban growth in the metropolitan region of Attica Greece under two scenarios of change towards 2050, to assess the total potential crop production loss of 12 selected crop classes. The scenarios implemented are based on policies mentioned in the Master Plans of Athens (former and newer version) for protecting and enhancing peri-urban space and agricultural areas. The business-as-usual BAU scenario represents current growth trends, while the agriculture-preservation APR scenario implements restrictive to urbanization measures on agricultural areas and a zoning system to preserve harvested area and production. Using SLEUTH’s outputs together with crop spatial data, both scenarios are assessed and examined."
"Validating diffusion tractography derived connectivity measures of the
rat red nucleus and rubrospinal tract using neuroanatomical tracing","['Rietberg, Tim']","['Dijkhuizen, Rick']",2022-04-22T00:00:29Z,EN,"['tractography, red nucleus, rubrospinal tract, vaidation, tracing']",Neuroscience and Cognition,"Our bodies and brains are full of water, which is constantly moving around. When water
molecules move around freely, they will diffuse randomly and evenly in all directions. In the
brain, on the other hand, water molecules tend to move along the fibres of neurons that
connect each part of the brain. When an MRI machine is set up in a specific way, it becomes
sensitive to the movement of those water molecules. This technique is called diffusion
weighted imaging (DWI). The images that are obtained using DWI can then be used to infer
the direction of the fibres along which the molecules move. This is called diffusion
tractography. Diffusion tractography is very valuable in neuroscientific research. As an
example, consider the case of stroke patients. Many people suffer motoric impairments after
having a stroke and while some of them recover quite well, others never do. It is suggested
that the integrity of a few small neuron fibres such as the rubrospinal tract (RST) might help
to explain this difference in outcomes. Diffusion tractography is uniquely qualified as a
technique to investigate this in living patients. There is one issue though; tractography
algorithms can’t be blindly trusted. They need to be validated using other methods. This is
were animal models come in handy. Research on animals provides the opportunity to
investigate the same sample with neuroanatomical tracing methods, which are considered a
golden standard for validating tractography. It entails injecting a solution in the neuron-fibres
of interest, which can then be visualised through chemical processes. This study used
neuroanatomical tracing to validate diffusion tractography derived connectivity measures of
the red nucleus, the point of origin of the RST. The tracing techniques were successful, which
provided a database to compare the tractography methods to. This comparison suggests that
the algorithms that were used are not quite accurate yet. Although there were some
limitations, this finding means that more research should be done before these algorithms can
be deemed trustworthy enough for pre-clinical research into recovery after stroke."

DatAR is able to give users some insight into why and how these diseases are similar by showing brain topics that have been frequently co-occurring together with the diseases in
the literature. This insight, however, is limited as the user can not investigate the relations of brain topics nor explore them, which are important tasks for a neuroscientist in order to better understand the interrelations between brain topics. In this study we research how we can assist a neuroscientist to investigate and explore relations between brain topics in order to help them understand their interrelations and make it easier to find interesting and/or surprising relations that could prove to be a fruitful research area.

BicD2 Controls Cell Cycle-Dependent Positioning of Neural Stem cells,"['Schelt, Jasper van']","['Will, Lena']",2022-04-22T00:00:32Z,EN,['BicD2; RGC; Dynein; INM'],"Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology","Radial Glial Progenitors (RGPs) are elongated epithelial cells and are the primary progenitor cell during development of the mammalian neocortex. The RGP cell-cycle and nuclear migration within the ventricular zone (VZ) are tightly interdependent and misregulation of these processes can cause severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous knock down studies showed that the dynein activating adaptor protein BicD2 is essential for RGP nuclear migration and mitotic entry. However, the precise in vivo role of BicD2 in RGPs remains unclear. By comparing cell-type specific BicD2 conditional knockout mice, we found the location but not the number of mitotic progenitors was altered. Instead of entering mitosis strictly at the ventricular surface (VS), RGP now entered mitosis across the VZ. Analysis of chromatin morphology, cell morphology and the location of the nuclei and centrosomes suggest these cells are present in two distinct populations. One population appears to be halted in their mitotic progression and nuclear migration while the other is released from the VS and continues through mitosis. Altered RGC morphology is further supported by experiments using organotypic slice culture after ex vivo brain electroporation at early stages of development. Furthermore, immunostaining against BicD2 showed a punctate pattern at the VS and often localized to anti-Pericentrin positive punctae, hinting at additional functions of BICD2 in RGP. Together my data demonstrates surprising effects of BicD2-depletion in RGPs providing new insights into BicD2’s role in the development of the mammalian neocortex."

Nederlanders (De Hart, 2019). Daarnaast zijn traditioneel-burgerlijke waarden als een gezin
hebben en het financieel goed hebben belangrijk voor de Nederlander. Ook hedonistische
waarden als plezier maken zijn zeer belangrijk (Eisinga, Scheepers en Bles, 8 november
2012).

Voor dit onderzoek zijn 53 van de 54 persconferenties die gehouden zijn tussen maart 2020
en februari 2021 geanalyseerd. Dit is gedaan door middel van een kritische discoursanalyse
aan de hand van het driedimensionale model van Fairclough (2010). Om dit relatief grote
corpus te kunnen analyseren is gebruikgemaakt van analysesoftware Nvivo. De analyse is
uitgevoerd op tekstueel, discursief en sociocultureel niveau.

Uit het onderzoek komen een aantal kenmerken en eigenschappen naar voren waarop het
beeld van de Nederlander dat gevormd wordt in de coronapersconferenties is gebaseerd.
De Nederlander heeft het financieel goed, is hoger opgeleid, hecht belang aan feestdagen
met een etnisch-nationalistische grondslag, is saamhorig op deze feestdagen – maar ook in
het samen onder controle krijgen van corona – en maakt onderdeel uit van een gezin met
(jonge) thuiswonende kinderen.

Nederlanders die niet binnen dit plaatje passen zullen zich in mindere mate herkennen in
het in de coronapersconferenties gevormde beeld van de Nederlander. Juist omdat de
overheid er voor alle Nederlanders is, zou het nuttig zijn om in toekomstige
overheidscommunicatie naar de Nederlandse bevolking ervoor te zorgen dat het gevormde
beeld wat minder sterk op een beperkt aantal kenmerken en eigenschappen leunt."
Estimating biomass of economically important palms in Peru using UAV and satellite remote sensing,"['Zalman, Joey Zalman']","['Lammeren, Ron van']",2022-05-05T00:00:36Z,EN,['palm; biomass; forest; UAV; remote sensing; canopy height; Peru'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"Palm swamps in the Amazon are regarded as important carbon-dense ecosystems, with palms regarded as important non-timber forest products for local communities. Knowing the abundance and biomass of palms in these areas allows for better sustainable forest planning, but data collecting in the field is difficult and expensive. However, commercial UAV’s present opportunities for mapping palm abundance and biomass in a cost-effective way. 

The main objective of this study is to understand how effectively commercial RGB UAV can be used in dense tropical palm forests to detect palms and estimate the biomass. Palm biomass is estimated using allometric models that require palm height as input. The UAV imagery is used to create canopy height maps and is compared with other remote sensing derived height maps to determine which height dataset is best suitable for estimating palm biomass. The UAV derived palm locations from the Tagle Casapia et al. (2020) study are used to extract the palm crown height values from each height map. A total of six height maps were used to estimate palm biomass. The results showed that the detection rate of the UAV was in important factor when estimating palm biomass in plots. The palm heights mapped by the UAV has large errors and underestimated the palm heights. These UAV errors were mostly caused by the dense and complex canopies of tropical palm forests, where the ground is also not visible or covered by water, making palm crown identification and heights estimations difficult. The palm height maps by Potapov et al. (2021) and Asner (2021) had much lower errors, however all of the height maps underestimated the heights of palms taller than 34m. A linear model was also created to estimate the palm heights by using the UAV, Potapov and Asner maps as input. The Potapov and linear model height data had the lowest errors when estimating biomass.

UAV provides a cost-effective solution for mapping palms and their biomass, but has varying results based on the local forest structure. The RGB UAV palm detection method used for this study could however still be used for forest management and planning purposes, as the UAV is able to give an estimation of the number of palms and their biomass in an area. Remote sensing derived heights can also supplement field data collection, offering an alternative to labor intensive palm height
measurements in the field."

Nowadays, nearly everyone collects spatial data in the form of GNSS tracks through their smartdevices. This data can be used to detect physical activities. However, raw spatial data lacks context
and requires analysis, which can be time-consuming. For this purpose, various machine learning
models were trained in this research that can automatically classify sport activities performed in
GNSS tracks. Pre-labelled GNSS-tracks were used to train and test the models. Land-use data that
corresponded with the GNSS tracks was also used to find out to what extend it could influence the
models’ classification accuracy. The model trained with the support vector machines’ algorithm
achieved the highest classification accuracy with a classification accuracy of 82.6%. Adding land-use
data to the model also significantly increased its classification accuracy (+5.6%). Using land-use data
in other machine learning algorithms also significantly improved their models’ performance.
However, in these models, not all land-use features were found to have a positive influence on the
models’ performance."

Because of the choice for the kernel, this equation maps to a partial di􏰄erential equation called the inviscid Burgers' equation. We show in one-dimension, and claim it also holds in higher dimensions, that con- nected components in coloured Erdös-Renyi random graph asymptotically describe the solution to the Smoluchowski's equations for monodispersed intial conditions and the nonlinear PDE associated to it. Using Joyal's formalism of combinatorial species, we obtain a closed-form solution for these equations by counting connected components in the random graph. We also derive a simple equation for the blow up time of the Burgers' inviscid equation with the chosen bilinear form.
Using the insights obtained from our method, and adapting previous algorithms, we additionally propose a randomized numerical scheme that constructs d-coloured random graphs with N vertices and expected degree distribution in time O((d+1)N). Using this algorithm we can inexpensively compute solutions to the multiplicative multicomponent Smoluchowski's equation (and consequently to Burgers' inviscid equation) at any time before solution blow up, hence resolving the curse of dimen- sionality for this problem."

ANALYSING SOCIAL AND SPATIAL DIFFERENTIATION IN THE NETHERLANDS REGARDING SYRIAN NEWCOMERS’ PERSPECTIVES ON (THE ROLE OF WORK) FOR INTEGRATION","['Truijen, Mariëlle']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-05-05T00:00:38Z,EN,['Integration; Syrian newcomers; work; socio-spatial context; social groups'],International Development Studies,"This research examines the perspectives on and experiences with integration, especially focusing on the role of paid work, by different groups of Syrian newcomers in diverse socio-spatial contexts in the Netherlands. Integration is a hotly debated concept but does not know one agreed upon definition. In discussions around this topic, the perspectives of newcomers are often overlooked while they are main actors in processes of integration. Highlighting their views and experiences, especially regarding the essential aspect of paid work, is therefore of great relevance. Hereby, this research analyses social and spatial differentiation concerning this topic. This because newcomers’ experiences with their process of integration are embedded in structures of wider socio-spatial contexts and are influenced by their social attributes. The relevant social attributes looked at in this research are age, gender, ethnicity, level of education and type of residence. A qualitative view on the division between cities and villages allows for an analysis of different socio-spatial contexts. An intersectional approach has been used to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the interrelatedness between these aspects. Thereby, the conceptual framework of integration by Strang and Ager (2008) is used to put into perspective similar research findings on key aspects emerging from this research. The research methods used are the conduction of sixteen semi-structured interviews with Syrian newcomers together with three expert conversations. Regarding the findings, this research first of all identified six key aspects of integration being cultural knowledge, personal development, social network, connection with host society, safety and stability and work. Those findings align in large part with the key aspects of Strang and Ager’s conceptual framework of integration from 2008. Regarding integration in general, younger and Kurdish newcomers tend to have the least difficulty with their process of integration, especially those who live without family and those who reside in cities. With regard to experiences with paid work for integration, those who are male, younger, lower educated, live in a city and own a permanent residence permit appear to be most likely to have positive experiences with the search for work and/or working in the Netherlands."
"Forced displacement in Mali
Analysing the effect of physical environment data on refugee flight routes in Flee","['Boesjes, Freek']","['Verstegen, Judith']",2022-05-05T00:00:34Z,EN,[],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"The twenty-first century has seen an increase in conflict-induced refugees (UNHCR, 2021). Understanding the refugee movements that result from these conflicts could aid policy makers and humanitarian organizations in providing aid to and hosting these forcibly displaced peoples (Suleimenova et al., 2017). To this end, Flee was developed (Groen, 2016). Flee is an agent-based social simulation framework for forecasting population displacements in an armed conflict setting (Anastasiadis et al., 2021; Suleimenova & Groen, 2020). Currently the flee-model does not take into account the possibility of refugees taking off-road routes. The goal of this study is therefore to implement into Flee the possibility for off-road driving routes, and test the effectiveness.
The off-road routes are determined by selecting features of the physical environment relevant to refugee movement, and representing these in raster data per season. Values are assigned to the selected features, to represent the degree of resistance that these features offer. The modelled resistance is changed to a cost raster, which allows for the plotting of routes of least cumulative resistance between two points. The resulting routes are used as input for Flee. 
Overall, the model’s refugee allocation error has decreased by 16.5% as a result of the changes in routes. However, most of this change is caused by an improvement of allocation in one camp, that influences the total through its relatively large size. When comparing the impact of the routes on the difference in error per location, while weighting the camps equally, the error increases by roughly 7%. Moreover, on a temporal level, the first and last season’s error are lower due to border closure and camp capacity mechanics in Flee. The error in season two and three (April – Oct 2012) are thus the most reliable for testing the differences in model accuracy. These seasons show overall a negligible difference in error. 
In conclusion, the addition of routes based on the physical environment does improve the overall accuracy of Flee’s refugee allocation in the Mali case study, but the results are too inconsistent to determine whether this will be the case in other case studies as well. Other factors are the root cause of current differences between the model and reality. These root causes include for example political factors, such as border restriction policies, and decision-making based on emotional factors, such as the attractiveness of cities over refugee camps."

For this, the solutions were categorized based on the type of green or blue infrastructure (GBI) mentioned in the respective study. From 42 preselected publications, most were about ‘building greens’, such as green roofs. Next, the mentioned ESS in 12 publications were classified using the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES). Further analysis of these publications showed that Regulating & Maintenance services are studied most and that cultural services appear to be the most difficult to quantify. The numerous ways in which green UHI solutions provide ESS are partially known, but not completely quantified in the analyzed studies. In general, most publications quantify the ESS ‘Regulation of temperature and humidity’, but do not provide a complete quantification of other mentioned ESS. It is recommended that -when implementing green solutions to create a more climate resistant and adaptable city-, all ESS of the solutions are qualified and quantified extensively. This helps to create a comprehensive and specific picture of the benefits provided by nature in the build environment."
Epigenetics in Type 2 Diabetes,"['Jennekens, Jitte']","['Koning, Eelco de']",2022-05-31T00:00:43Z,EN,[],Regenerative Medicine and Technology,"T2D has become a major health issue over the past decades, and ultimately this could benefit the discovery of new treatment or prevention strategies to relieve the pressure on the health care system. Long before T2D onset, pathologic alterations are already present. The two primary mechanisms leading to T2D are insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion by the beta cells of the pancreas. Both defects are required in order to progress to T2D. In the early phase of T2D development, beta cells can still compensate for the insulin resistance by increasing their insulin secretion. However, this has a limit and after the maximal capacity is reached, beta cells lose their function and insulin secretion declines. Epigenetics have been implicated in T2D development, since they are known to link environmental factors to the genome. Epigenetics include DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin structure remodeling. Bulk studies have already identified a number of epigenetic alterations in disease-relevant tissues for T2D. With the technological advances also single-cell methods are being developed and used. The main reason that such techniques are important is the heterogeneity of tissue samples currently used for study, which masks important single-cell effects. However, adaptation to single-cell methods still faces a number of challenges, yet with the rapid technological developments the future for single-cell epigenomic studies looks promising."
Interaction of isogenic Streptococcus pneumoniae capsule mutants with components of the human (mucosal) immune system,"['Bakx, Jacco']","['Strijp, Jos van']",2022-05-31T00:00:40Z,EN,['Streptococcus pneumoniae; capsule mutants; mucosal immune system'],Infection and Immunity,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major contributor to death of children worldwide. The bacteria can cause pneumonia, otitis media and meningitis, causing severe illness or death. It is estimated that between 8-12% of all deaths of children between the ages of 1 and 59 months is caused by S. pneumococcus infection. In order to efficiently infect its hosts, S. pneumococcus makes use of a capsule, a sugar-based coating surrounding the bacteria. The capsule provides the bacteria with protection against various components of the immune system by blocking the function of antibacterial factors (complement) and the clearance of the bacteria by immune cells. Because of this importance for the bacterium’s survival, the capsule is also used to distinguish different strains of S. pneumococcus in a clinical setting. In this study, we make use of capsule mutants; a single strain of S. pneumococcus carrying capsule types derived from strains found in the human population. By using these capsule mutants, we were able to find differences between capsules with regards to the binding to human airway cells, amount of complement deposited on the bacteria and the resistance against clearance by the human immune system. While the amount of binding and deposition of complement did not show a relation with the frequency of causing disease reported for the capsule serotypes, the resistance against clearance by the immune system did seem to have a relation with how often a strain is able to infect children. We hope that the results of this research can be used to obtain a better understanding of the function of the S. pneumococcus capsule."

Here, we investigate motor cortex RNA stability and its genetic underpinning in a cohort of ALS patients. RNA stability captures information about RNA misprocessing and is estimated using total RNA sequencing data. Analyses of RNA stability estimates show that outliers occur disproportionally in neuronal pathways relevant to ALS such as synaptic vesicle recycling and neuron projection regeneration. The genetics underlying RNA stability are studied firstly by relating the most common mutation underlying ALS, C9orf72 expansions, to RNA stability. We find that C9orf72 positive samples generally have lower RNA stabilities. Next, evolutionary scores as well as scores for impact on RNA-binding affinity are calculated for genetic variants. However, relating these scores with RNA stabilities did not yield any significant results. Overall, we demonstrate the importance of using RNA stability for studying ALS and recommend several improvements to the methodology, including the incorporation of micro-RNAs and transcript features into the statistical models, to capitalize on its potential for further discoveries in ALS and other phenotypes."

Through a case study of Finnish and Dutch high school students who performed collaborative tasks in the virtual world (VW) OpenSim, this study explored the intercultural learning opportunities, the students’ participation and engagement with each other, and the impact of the VW on the intercultural learning of the students. Following Jauregi et al.’s (2011) framework for task-based intercultural communicative language teaching, the tasks were designed by Bastian and Reinhardt (2016) with the aim to foster the students’ intercultural awareness and competence, and thereby create opportunities for the students to compare, contrast and reflect on their respective cultures. The results of the qualitative interaction analysis show that the tasks allowed for various moments of intercultural learning: the students became critically aware of their cultural norms and how they may differ across cultures, reflected on cultural stereotypes, and showed aspects of all five of Byram’s (1997) savoirs of intercultural communicative competence (ICC). However, the students were seen to have difficulties explaining cultural phenomenons and differences in-depth, and required teacher mediation for the progression of the majority of the discussions. This could be the result of the students’ inexperience with explaining and reflecting on culture. The analysis also demonstrated that the Dutch students tended to be more assertive in their engagement with the topics of discussion, whereas the Finnish were quieter and seemed to have more difficulties following and contributing to the discussion. A reason for this could be the differences in age, English levels, and communication styles between the Dutch and Finnish students (Bastian & Reinhardt, 2016). To benefit intercultural learning, it is important to include preparation and follow-up tasks to allow for the students to participate in collaborative tasks without teacher mediation and to allow for the reflection on differences in communication styles to create awareness and understanding among the students. Finally, the students expressed that they enjoyed working together in the VW because of its immersive nature and the sense of anonymity due to the absence of webcams, indicated by the side-sequences that enriched the authentic social interactions. However, the students indicated that the medium Skype also would have been suitable for the completion of the tasks. This suggests that the tasks could benefit from a more immersive task design that would allow students to interact with their environment and avatars to a greater extent."
Development of NTCP-models to predict the presence of laryngeal edema six months after radiotherapy of head-and-neck cancer,"['Heilmaier, Christina']","['Schuit, E.']",2022-06-04T00:00:40Z,EN,"['NTCP-model, larynx edema,  post-radiogenic, head-and-neck. cancer']",Epidemiology Postgraduate,"Background: Photon-based radiation therapy is important in the treatment of head-and-neck cancer (HNC). However, potential post-radiogenic complications may have a long-lasting negative impact on the patient's quality of life. The current study focused on the presence of laryngeal edema 6 months after irradiation of HNC and had three main objectives: (I) external validation of the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP)-model published by Rancati based on the equivalent uniform dose (EUD), (II) development of new NTCP-models using a large training cohort, (III) external validation of the new models with an independent validation data set.
Methods: The training cohort consisted of n=750 and the validation cohort of n=395 patients. For both cohorts, a sub-cohort including patients with non-laryngeal HNC was formed (n=416 and n=227 participants, respectively). Multiple imputation was executed to compensate for missing values. Rancati’s model performance was assessed with both the training and the validation cohort, determining the discrimination (area-under-the-curve, AUC) and calibration parameters (calibration intercept and slope). Following, candidate predictors for new models were selected, their correlation and multicollinearity was checked and the required sample size was calculated. New models were set up with stepwise regression (p<0.20), considering different (sub-)cohorts and candidate predictors to comprehensively answer the research question. The performance of the new models was analyzed and cross-validation (cv) was executed to account for optimism. Finally, external validation of the new models was performed.
Results: External validation of Rancati’s model revealed a poor calibration and moderate model performance with the training data set (AUC=0.66; 95%-confidence interval (CI): 0.60-0.71). Analysis of 11 different NTCP-models showed that the model consisting of dose values (= mean dose to the glottic and supraglottic area = GLOTTIC DMEAN and SUPRAGLOTTIC DMEAN), the treatment regimen (SEQUENCE), and clinical parameters (SMOKING and AGE) yielded the best result in estimating laryngeal edema in non-laryngeal HNC patients (cvAUC: 0.86 (0.74-0.97), calibration intercept: 0.06 (0.04-0.08), slope: 1.01 (1.0-1.01)). In contrast, only the dose values (GLOTTIC DMEAN and SUPRAGLOTTIC DMEAN) turned out to be relevant in the sub-cohort of laryngeal HNC patients (cvAUC: 0.66 (0.58-0.74), intercept: 0.24 (-0.19-0.46), slope: 1.17 (1.02-1.27)) and the total cohort (cvAUC: 0.75 (0.74-0.77), intercept: 0.04 (0.03-0.05), slope: 1.02 (1.02-1.02)), which could be attributed to differences in the clinical characteristics of the respective patients. Regardless of the patient cohort, the combination of GLOTTIC DMEAN and SUPRAGLOTTIC DMEAN was superior to GLOTTIC DMAX and SUPRAGLOTTIC DMAX (= maximum dose to the glottic and supraglottic area) and the laryngeal EUD. Moderate to high correlation between the dose values was evident (range of correlation coefficients=0.69-0.92) but without significant multicollinearity as indicated by variance-inflation-factors of 1.01-2.16. Comparison of the external validation of Rancati’s and the new NTCP-models with the validation data set revealed better performance parameters of the new models (e.g., AUC: 0.69-0.97 versus 0.51 for Rancati).
Conclusions: New NTCP-models relying on dosimetric and non-dosimetric variables achieve a better prediction of the risk of post-radiogenic laryngeal edema in HNC patients compared to recent models based entirely on dose data. This is an essential step towards individualized patient treatment."
Multi-fraction sediment sorting and entrainment at the Prins Hendrikzanddijk,"['klein Obbink, Martijn']","['Price, Timothy']",2022-06-04T00:00:51Z,EN,[],Earth Surface and Water,"Since the 1990’s sand nourishments are increasingly used to improve coastal safety at the wave-dominated North Sea coast. Generally, the nourished sediment is kept similar to the naturally occurring sediment and in most cases consists of well-sorted sand. However, recently, sandy beaches are also used to strengthen dykes in regions that are not wave-dominated. The Prins Hendrikzanddijk (PHZD) is an example of such a sandy retrofit, located on the leeward side of the Dutch barrier island of Texel. Additionally, a layer of coarse sediment was added on top of the PHZD in order to limit erosion. This has resulted in a complex spatiotemporally varying sediment composition
in a mixed wave-current environment. It is expected that this combination of factors results in highly variable and complex sediment entrainment and transport processes, which are not yet fully understood. This research focuses on the spatiotemporally variability in the sediment composition and how this affects sediment entrainment
transport at the PHZD in an aim to improve our fundamental understanding of these processes. 

During a 6-week (SEDMEX; mixed SEDiments in Mixed Energy eXperiment) field campaign in early autumn at the PHZD, instruments were deployed at 6 alongshore locations, of which two had additional instruments in the cross-shore. The collected data consist of measurements on waves, currents and sediment (composition and transport). A total of 139 sediment samples were collected in the intertidal area at different cross-shore locations and over varying time intervals. Wave and current shear stresses were combined with the sediment composition to do a multi-fraction mobility analysis which is then compared to measured turbidity from Optical Backscatter Sensors (OBS).

The sediment mixture was coarse (average 1032 µm) and poorly sorted (σG 2.3 – 2.7) across the entire cross-shore location L2. Finer grain sizes were observed during calmer periods (430 – 850 µm) and coarser (1350 – 2000 µm) during energetic conditions. Wave related shear stresses were on average 5 times larger than that of currents.
The results from the multi-fraction mobility analysis showed that the Shields number was often close to the critical Shields for incipient motion which resulted in preferential transport of the finer sediments. Over time this led to coarsening of the bed. Energetic conditions were able completely mix up the bed increasing the availability of fine
sediments and flattening the beach profile. A conceptual Figure and model illustrate the how the processes affect each other and highlights how the storm frequency is an important factor in the availability of the fine sediments."
How to improve image contrast of hepatic CECT scans in children,"['Bochove, Aart van']","['Vincken, Koen']",2022-06-08T00:00:42Z,EN,['Contrast enhanced CT; hepatic; pediatric; protocol; portal-venous phase; quality'],Medical Imaging,"Introduction. Liver tumors are clinically evaluated using contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT). For children, this type of CECT usually consists of two scans, one in the arterial phase, and one in the portal-venous phase. In our institution, the portal-venous scan is not always of sufficient quality, especially in small children. The inadequate contrast between hepatic vascular structures and the liver parenchyma is thought to be secondary to differences in hemodynamics compared to adults. Here, we describe relationships between CECT scan parameters, scan quality and scan timing in children, resulting in insufficient quality of the scan. These relationships cannot necessarily be described mathematically. We aim to improve the scan protocol based on these relationships.
Methods & materials. Data from 55 CT scans of 40 pediatric patients was acquired at our institution. An experienced radiologist scored the quality of each scan (bad/mediocre/sufficient/good) and estimated the timing of the portal-venous phase (too early/good/too late). A histogram analysis was performed, to investigate relationships between different parameters such as age, weight, bolus concentration, flow rate, and the qualitative measures of scan quality and timing.
Results. A significant number of scans with a low quality score were made of children aged 5 or younger, and all scans that were made too early appear in the same category. Most scans scored as ‘bad’ are of patients who received less than 1.4 ml contrast agent per kg body weight. All bad scans occur with patients with a flow rate smaller or equal to 3 ml/s.
Conclusion & Discussion. Based on this data, we recommend to increase the concentration of the administered contrast for liver tumor CT scans in all children to 2.5 ml/kg or higher, possibly introducing a weight or age dependence. This recommendation can be used to change the scan protocol, but effects of this change should be monitored closely."

Methods: This is an observational study within the ongoing PLCRC cohort. We included 7651 patients, who were required to have at least one questionnaire completed in the year before COVID-19 pandemic. Patients filled out two questionnaires - (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and HADS questionnaire. Clinical data were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Linear mixed model analysis was used to assess the three outcomes of interest: HRQoL, anxiety and depression scores. Additionally, we stratified the models by 3 variables – living situation, gender and cancer stage. 
Results: In total the analysis included 3646 (44.6%) patients. The scores of quality of life analysis showed an upwards trend for all three variables in the stratified analysis with statistically significant differences on almost all timepoints. Anxiety score changes showed more variability, with still some significant differences. Depression scores showed almost no changes across all timepoints and variables. 
Conclusion: To conclude, our study showed increased HRQoL levels, slightly higher (but clinically insignificant) anxiety levels and, no change in depression levels in colorectal cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the results from the year before the COVID-19 pandemic."

KNL1 is a large scaffolding protein central to formation of the kinetochore which initiates spindle assembly checkpoint signalling to halter anaphase onset until microtubule attachment has been established. Given its important role in ensuring stable chromosome segregation, functioning of KNL1’s recruiters and close interactors Zwint-1 and Mis12 should also be acknowledged. Here, the role of Zwint-1 in the kinetochore is addressed, as previous research hasn’t been able to robustly identify the function of Zwint-1. A Zwint-1 knockout RPE1 cell line is presented, which exhibits increased chromosome segregation defects and a decreased time in mitosis. Immunofluorescence assessment of the kinetochore structure reveals disturbed localization of many kinetochore proteins, namely Bub1 and BubR1, as well as fibrous corona proteins CENP-E and Mad1. Furthermore, interkinetochore distance was increased in the Zwint-1 KO line, and formation of fibrous corona structures is impaired. Expressing Zwint-1 rescue constructs in the knockout line restores both
localization of the outer kinetochore proteins and chromosome segregation integrity. These findings illustrate the relevance of Zwint-1 in the kinetochore, and warrant further research in the precise mechanics behind its interaction with KNL1 to stabilize the kinetochore structure."
Fostering primary school children’s understanding of proteins through an educational AR app,"['Heemskerk, Anne']","['Matimba, H.E.K.']",2022-06-08T23:00:42Z,EN,['gamification; informal education; augmented reality; proteins'],Science Education and Communication,"Science is often known to the general public as being difficult and scary. Since science anxiety already starts at primary school, it is argued that it is best to start teaching science at that age. A way to do so is by presenting science in an interactive and entertaining way. Even though science education is seen as important in primary schools it is not realised due to the overcrowded curriculum. This research project proposes to contribute to children’s understanding of proteins by investigating an augmented reality-assisted app that learners can use to gain knowledge about and insight into this topic. While investigating this, it is also examined whether this app tackles the problem of misconceptions that the learners may have about proteins. 
The main research question To what extent does an augmented reality assisted protein app support primary school children (aged 9-12) in their understanding and engagement regarding proteins? is answered in a qualitative research through 6 sub-questions by means of surveys, interviews, and observations. 16 participants from two different primary schools completed a pre questionnaire, after which they played the hemoglobin challenge of the BodyBits app, and then completed a post questionnaire. After a period of  8 weeks 7 of the participants were interviewed. 
It can be concluded that however the target group’s prior knowledge regarding proteins is limited and they may need more guidance than the app now gives them, the participants are able to deal with abstract and complex information on a sufficient level. On the formative assessment questions of the questionnaire, the participants scored reasonably high, considering they have not been taught about proteins before. However, most participants did not retain this knowledge after a period of 8 weeks. Nonetheless, the game seemed to be engaging to the target audience, which was expressed in the questionnaires and interviews but was also observed when they were playing the game."
Antifungal discovery: Unlocking the hidden potential of fungal genomes,"['Bierhuizen, Dolf']","['Cock, Hans de']",2022-06-08T23:00:39Z,EN,['Anti-fungal; genome-mining; secondary metabolites'],Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences,"Fungal infections are becoming more common around the world and can vary in severity from inconvenient to lethal. Effective antifungal agents exist, but resistant fungal strains are becoming more prevalent, highlighting the need for novel antifungal agents. Microorganisms in the wild compete with each other for resources and territory. To fight off other organisms they produce molecules called secondary metabolites that can have antimicrobial properties. This makes secondary metabolites an interesting source of novel compounds in drug discovery. This review aims to describe the way we can discover these novel antifungal drugs.
Fungi produce a lot of secondary metabolites. They are produced by enzymes that are expressed by different genes that are often found together in a cluster. These clusters are called biosynthetic gene clusters. It is possible to scan genomes of fungi for the presence of these biosynthetic gene clusters, based on the presence of certain genes that are known to code for biosynthetic enzymes. Gene clusters that encode for secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity share certain characteristics like the presence of resistance genes or duplications of essential genes. These characteristics allow for identification of gene clusters that are potentially antifungal. Gene clusters of interest can be expressed in the host or in another organism in order to investigate the secondary metabolite that is produces. To possibly improve the qualities of the new compound as an antifungal agent, there are ways to modify the secondary metabolite by changing the composition of the biosynthetic gene cluster. Altogether these methods form a pipeline for discovering novel antifungal agents by analysing fungal genomes."
Protein tyrosine phosphatase signaling in development and health,"['Kalaitsidou, Elisavet']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-06-16T23:00:49Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Intracellular signalling for fundamental processes such as cell growth, differentiation, and cell-cell adhesion are finely controlled through the antagonistic actions of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), and at multiple levels. PTKs and PTPs have opposing functions in catalysing the addition or removal of phosphate groups from Tyrosine residues respectively, but these two classes of enzymes work in concerted action to ensure a critical balance in phosphorylation signaling, as well as control the duration of such signaling. The need to enable phosphorylation signaling in a tissue-specific, temporal-specific and substrate-specific manner highlights the critical role for PTPs, particularly in developmental processes, and in vital processes that ensure a healthy cellular state. It is therefore not surprising that PTP dysfunction has been associated with cancers, metabolic diseases, and development syndromes that display a spectrum of phenotypic defects. In this review, I will focus my discussion on the critical role for PTPs, and the regulation thereof, in early development and diseases."

Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Recent findings show clinical levels of IU in AN, and 
increased IU is associated with greater degrees of negative mood and impairments in 
daily functioning. Despite its potential implications for treatment improvements, there 
are no experimental studies exploring changeability of IU in AN. Adopting an 
experimental paradigm used in anxiety samples, the aim of this study is to examine 
whether IU can be experimentally manipulated in AN and to investigate the 
contribution of IU to eating pathology (EP) in women with AN. Adult females with a 
DSM 5 AN diagnosis were recruited from a specialized eating disorder clinic. All 
participants completed the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire, Intolerance of 
Uncertainty Scale and visual analogue scales for state IU and EP before receiving 
either a high or low IU manipulation; after the manipulation levels of IU were 
assessed again. It was hypothesized that participants in the high IU condition would 
report significantly higher levels of eating pathology than participants in the low IU 
condition, post the manipulation. Results revealed clinical levels of IU in both groups. 
Against the expectations of the study, there were no differences between the high IU 
group and the low IU group after the manipulation, hence no analyses associations of 
IU on EP were implemented. Surprisingly, although in the high IU condition, levels of 
IU did not increase, in the low IU condition levels of IU reduced significantly, 
suggesting that malleability of levels of state IU in AN is feasible. Further 
experimental investigations into the changeability of IU are needed to improve our 
understanding of its contribution to AN development and maintenance."

Development of Cell-Based Assays for the Evaluation of novel SARS-CoV-2 Inhibitors,"['Klijmeij, Kyra']","['Kuppeveld, Frank van']",2022-07-07T00:00:33Z,EN,['SARS-CoV-2; Cell-based Assay; Mpro; Cyclic Luciferase; Spike Protein; Cell-Cell Fusion'],Drug Innovation,"SARS-CoV-2 has made a large impact on society in the past years due to its high transmissibility which led to the COVID-19 pandemic. Academia and the drug development industry have made fast advances to provide potent inhibitors against the virus, but the holy grail has not yet been found. The potency of these inhibitors can be tested in several assays. Cell-based assays are favourable as, in contrast to biochemical assays, they can assess the cell-permeability and toxicity of the inhibitors. This project, therefore, aimed to develop multiple cell-based assays for the evaluation of potential inhibitors that each target various aspects of the viral replication cycle to advance the discovery of novel and much-needed SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.

The viral replication can be inhibited by targeting the viral Main Protease (Mpro). This protease has been well studied for various coronaviruses and is a popular drug target. A previous assay has been designed around the Mpro (Van der Linden et al., 2014; manuscript in preparation) but this assay lacked sensitivity and was not able to detect inhibitors with a lower inhibitory efficacy. A new assay was therefore designed to also identify less potent inhibitors. This assay is based on a cyclic luciferase, that can be linearized after Mpro cleavage. Linearization enables luciferase activation and loss of signal can therefore imply successful inhibition. The assay was compared to the previous luciferase assay and showed lower luciferase activity than the previous system. Alterations in transfection time and plasmid DNA concentrations did not improve the activity. Other factors came to light that may influence and improve the assay for future use. Currently, this assay can be easily performed but cannot be used for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor identification in its current state.

To assess cell entry inhibition, a cell-cell fusion assay was established that can be performed in a BSL-1 setting, as opposed to the BSL-2 setting that is being used for the established pseudotype virus entry assay. SARS-CoV-2 can induce syncytia formation by spike protein-induced membrane fusion. HEK293T cells are transfected with SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein and GFP S(11) and added to VeroE6 cells transfected with TMPRSS2 and GFP S(1-10). Due to GFP complementation after fusion, the fusion activity can be visualized. After upscaling and automation of the imaging and quantification of the assay, the assay can visually detect fusion inhibition by various compounds. The fusion inhibition is currently quantified via algorithmic syncytia identification. This method provides large improvements in the performability of the assay as it is less time-consuming than manual counting and allows for the upscaling of the assay. However, this method is accompanied by measurement inaccuracies that lead to the misidentification of syncytia. More accurate quantification may be provided by measuring GFP intensity.

Even though the assays are still in need of further optimization, they are at this moment easy to perform, can be applied in a BSL1/2 setting, and show promise for successful antiviral identification. The future use of these assays for the identification and evaluation of novel SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors is therefore not yet dismissed."
Implementing the Component Algorithm Strategy (CAS) using Electronic Health Records in a Multi-Database Study (MDBS),"['Soman, Kanaka']","['Gardarsdottir, H.']",2022-07-02T00:00:39Z,EN,[],Epidemiology,"Abstract:
Background: There is an increasing trend to use electronic healthcare databases to conduct drug safety studies since they are more efficient compared to primary data capture. EHR databases can still have less statistical power if the information on exposure and/or outcome of interest is rare to obtain a sufficient sample size. A way to solve this problem is by conducting a multi-database study (MDBS). MDBS pose several challenges including how to manage heterogeneity between the different included data sources. Therefore, it is necessary to find data source specific methodologies to conduct MDBS. One of the strategies is the Component Algorithm Strategy. Here, the choice of a particular event-finding algorithm is generally dependent on the characteristics of the data source. By creating different event-finding algorithms, we aimed to demonstrate the impact and usefulness of the component algorithm strategy by applying it to a case study which investigated the risk of GI bleeding and stroke in New Oral Anti-Coagulants (NOACs) versus Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) users.
Methods: The component algorithm strategy was developed using data from two European healthcare databases- CPRD Gold (UK) and PHARMO (The Netherlands). GI Bleeding and Stroke algorithms were created for available data domains (diagnoses, signs/symptoms), healthcare settings and concept sets (signs/symptoms for GI Bleeding and Non-traumatic, Traumatic and Unspecified for Stroke). Algorithm- and database-specific incident rates for study outcomes were estimated for the study period 2010 – 2019. Cox regression analysis was performed to calculate the risk of GI bleeding or stroke while using NOACs/VKAs and adjusted for confounders.
Results/Conclusion: The implementation of the component algorithm strategy had a visible impact on the cases retrieved by each algorithm, with sensitive algorithms detecting higher number of cases compared to more specific algorithms. When calculated for each event definition, the risk of GI bleeding and stroke was higher in DOAC users compared to VKA users in CPRD Gold data source, whereas there was an increased risk of GI bleeding or stroke in VKA users for some event definitions in the PHARMO database, whereas VKAs showed a protective effect for some other event definitions.

Plain Language Summary:
Although randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard to assess the safety and effectiveness of a new pharmaceutical product, they exclude a wide variety of population and therefore it is necessary to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drugs also in the excluded populations. One of the solutions to solve this problem is making use of electronic health records (EHR) to and studying the utilisation and effectiveness of the drugs in the real world. However, these EHR databases pose some problems when the drug or the medical condition of interest is rare and there are not enough people to obtain a sufficient sample size. To overcome this, multiple data sources are used in a single study which has its strengths and limitations. One of the limitations is the differences between the two data sources known as database heterogeneity. This could be due to differences in the way data is collected within the two data sources. Therefore, it is necessary to develop strategies that are tailor made for each data source. One of the strategies, known as the Component Algorithm strategy, makes use of specific data domains present in the data source to identify events of interest. By creating such algorithms, we can aim to overcome the issue of database heterogeneity while retrieving outcomes of interest."

Because of their independent mechanisms of replication and transfer, the study of plasmids is of special interest in epidemiology. The introduction of short read sequencers has brought an abundance of data to microbial genomics with great potential to increase knowledge of microbial biology and inform epidemiological decision making. With this increase in data availability comes the need for computational methods to extract meaningful information from that data. Machine learning tools have been developed to distinguish plasmids from chromosomes in short read draft genome assemblies. RFPlasmid is such a tool that uses random forests to classify bacterial contigs. To explore potential improvements of RFPlasmid, a machine learning pipeline was developed in Scikit-Learn. The machine learning pipeline addresses the issue of imbalanced datasets, which is a common problem as generally more chromosomes are sequenced than plasmids. It also probed several methods of feature selection to aid in separating signal from noise in a wide and sparse dataset and thereby improve classifications. Imbalance remains a difficult challenge which requires a multi-faceted approach to improve models of species for which few plasmid sequences are publicly available. Feature selection did not improve explainability or reduce model complexity. Critical issues came to light showing the combination of fully grown random forests using kmers is problematic when modeling plasmids. The insights from this project can be used as a starting point to develop better machine learning algorithms for plasmid detection. However, other computational methods, including graph, mapping and clustering based approaches may be more promising."
Towards the implementation of Bunkering Infrastructure for New Energy Carriers for Inland Navigation in The Netherlands,"['Damwijk, Ruben']","['Kramer, Gert Jan']",2022-07-06T00:00:36Z,EN,['Bunkering Infrastructure; Electricity; Energy Science; Hydrogen; Methanol'],Energy Science,"To reach the goals set in the Climate Agreement (Klimaatakkoord), many industrial sectors must take measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The transition to a more sustainable Netherlands has gained momentum, with logistics and mobility as one of the key components. An important role is reserved for the inland navigation (i.e., inland shipping) sector within the logistics and mobility sector, as it is responsible for 43% of the total transport performance. For the inland navigation sector, the ambitions are to have at least 150 vessels with a zero-emission power train in 2030 and to have a virtually zero-emission and climate-neutral inland fleet by 2050. However, the process of making the inland navigation sector sustainable is still in an early stage and consists mostly of pilot projects. To shape the transition to sustainable mobility, more insights are needed into which bunkering infrastructure is required.

The aim of the research is to generate a techno-economic framework that can be used to determine whether bunkering and charging infrastructure for new energy carriers (i.e., hydrogen, methanol and electricity) is feasible from an economic and technical point of view in the inland navigation sector. The techno-economic framework consists of a supply chain analysis of the different energy carriers and a cost model simulation of different scenarios by 2030. Additionally, interviews with experts and stakeholders provide insights into which bunkering infrastructure components are applicable in the Netherlands by 2030. 

The equivalent annual cost, capital investment, demand of an energy carrier, spatial requirements and cost of energy service for different bunkering infrastructure business cases have been calculated by the model. The demand is based on the ambition of having 150 sustainable vessels by 2030. To facilitate a bunkering infrastructure for 150 vessels with a zero-emission power train, the implementation of a bunkering infrastructure for battery electric containers with small charging facilities would be overall the best option. In the short-term, a bunkering infrastructure for methanol could be implemented as the investment is relatively small. Methanol has better use as a transitional energy carrier.

Much depends on external factors such as competition of other sustainable energy carriers. Besides the technological and economic parameters, an equal consensus among vessel owners, investors and energy carrier suppliers to invest and use such bunkering infrastructure."
Sociale veiligheid: harde eis of zachte vraag?,"['Meijerhof, Mats']","['Slobbe, Michel van']",2022-07-05T00:00:35Z,NL,['sociale veiligheid; sportbeleid; beleidsvertaling; beleidsontwerp'],Sportbeleid en sportmanagement,"In de laatste jaren komen berichten over grensoverschrijdend gedrag in de sport steeds vaker 
in de media. Uit onderzoek van het Mulier Instituut (2021) blijkt dat sportverenigingen 
desondanks (nog) onvoldoende maatregelen treffen om sociale veiligheid binnen hun 
vereniging te waarborgen. Dit is ondanks inspanningen vanuit nationale en lokale overheden, 
die al sinds 1991 bezig zijn met het veiligheid binnen de sport (Steenbergen et al., 2018). Voor 
gemeenten is dit aanleiding om het thema sociale veiligheid bij de lokale sportclubs onder de 
aandacht te brengen. Deze lokale sportclubs kennen echter relatieve autonomie, en voeren 
niet per definitie overheidsbeleid uit (van Bottenburg, 2007). Om inzicht te geven in de 
dynamiek die in dit beleidsprobleem speelt, staat het theoretische concept ‘beleidsvertaling’
(Skille, 2008) centraal. De theorie over beleidsvertaling beschrijft dat het implementeren van 
beleid gepaard gaat met een proces van vertaling, waarbij ontvangers beleid actief 
interpreteren en toepassen op hun eigen situatie (Skille, 2008). De volgende onderzoeksvraag
staat centraal binnen dit onderzoek: Hoe wordt gemeentelijk sportbeleid op het gebied van 
sociale veiligheid vertaald door lokale sportclubs?
Om deze vraag te beantwoorden, wordt binnen dit onderzoek ingezoomd op de gemeente 
Amsterdam en gemeente Utrecht. Binnen deze gemeenten is aan de hand van interviews met 
beleidsmedewerkers van beide gemeenten en een oud-medewerker van SportUtrecht in kaart 
gebracht hoe het beleidsontwerp op het gebied van sociale veiligheid in beide gemeenten eruit
ziet. Vervolgens is in beide gemeenten met een vijftal sportclubs gesproken over het thema 
sociale veiligheid, om te onderzoek hoe sportclubs het beleid van hun gemeente in de praktijk 
vertalen.
Uit de resultaten blijkt dat het beleid van de gemeente Amsterdam wordt gekenmerkt door 
sanctionering, met het opleggen van basiseisen aan sportclubs, waar het beleid van de 
gemeente Utrecht gekenmerkt wordt door de ondersteuning van sportclubs om met dit thema 
aan de slag te gaan. Geconcludeerd wordt dat deze verschillen in het beleidsontwerp van beide 
gemeenten, leiden tot verschillen tussen de beleidsvertaling door lokale sportclubs in beide 
gemeenten. Waar het beleidsontwerp van de gemeente Amsterdam dwingender van karakter 
is, leidt dit tot nauwere beleidsvertaling door sportclubs, waarbij de beleidsideeën van de 
gemeente Amsterdam in hoge mate worden gekopieerd, wat leidt tot een uniforme uitkomst 
binnen de gesproken sportclubs. Het beleidsontwerp van de gemeente Utrecht is flexibeler van 
aard, wat leidt tot ruimere beleidsvertaling door sportclubs, waarbij beleidsideeën meer worden 
aangepast aan de situatie van de individuele sportclub, wat leidt tot meer uiteenlopende 
uitkomsten tussen de sportclubs. Gesteld wordt dat beide beleidsontwerpen voordelen en 
nadelen kennen, waarbij het zoeken naar ‘lokale universaliteit’ (Sausman, Oborn & Barrett, 
2016) belangrijk lijkt om het thema sociale veiligheid binnen sportclubs verder te brengen."
Morphodynamic equilibrium of width and bed level profile of an estuary in response to adjustable channel widths,"['Janssen, Michal']","['Vegt, Maarten van der']",2022-07-01T00:01:06Z,EN,['estuary; channel width; morphology; morphodynamic equilibrium; numerical model'],Earth Surface and Water,"In this thesis, the morphodynamic equilibrium of the width and bed level profile of estuaries is studied. This is done by using an one-dimensional hydrodynamic and morphodynamic model that includes variable channel widths. The width is determined by a hydraulic geometry relation that relates the width to the peak in total discharge, which is dependent on both the fluvial and tidal influence. A river discharge is forced on the upstream boundary of the channel and a tide is forced upon the downstream boundary of the channel. The channel starts as a straight channel and then evolves towards a steady state with respect to the channel width and bed level. The equilibrium width and bed level profiles largely depend on the coefficients used in the hydraulic geometry relation. These coefficients were underestimated, but the model produced a realistic cross-sectional area tidal prism relation that did not depend on these coefficients. The results generally show that longer estuaries with a larger ratio between the width at the mouth and the width upstream are developed when the tidal amplitude or initial channel depth are larger, or when the river discharge, the initial slope or the drag coefficient are smaller. The width ratio can actually be directly related to the tide dominance ratio, whereas the estuary length mainly depends on the channel depth at the mouth, the estuary bed slope and the tidal amplitude. More convergent estuaries with a shorter e-folding length scale are developed when the initial slope or drag coefficient are larger or the initial channel depth is smaller. Interestingly, the results show that the convergence is greatly dependent on a balance between the river discharge and tidal amplitude. Generally, the estuary is more convergent with larger tidal amplitudes and smaller river discharges. However, if the river discharge is too low or the tidal amplitude too high, the estuary will develop a concave instead of a convex width profile. The equilibrium bed levels were all concave down with an increasing depth towards the mouth. Overall, the model shows great potential for predicting the equilibrium width and bed level profile of estuaries to changing boundary conditions if the hydraulic geometry relation coefficients are optimized."

Girls have a higher chance of developing depression and anxiety, and the transmission from parents is also higher than for males. The current study addresses the hypothesis that (a) girls show more depression and anxiety symptoms than boys; (b) the offspring of mothers with depression and anxiety display more depression and anxiety symptoms than the offspring of fathers with depression and anxiety; and (c) the association between offspring gender and the depression and anxiety symptoms is dependent on the gender of the affected parent. For the hypotheses testing, results were taken from the ARIADNE (“Adolescents at Risk of Anxiety and Depression; A combined Neurobiological and Epidemiological approach”) study. A total of 412 offspring and their parents’ information was eligible for analysis within this research. For hypothesis (a), the results demonstrate that female offspring had a higher mean and prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms. For hypothesis (b), the children of mothers with depression or anxiety do not show more depression or anxiety symptoms than the children of fathers with depression or anxiety. For hypothesis (c), the affected parents’ sex is not significant in offspring association with depression and anxiety symptoms. 
The current study showed that female offspring show a higher mean across all the symptoms that were in this study. Female offspring had a higher prevalence of almost all the symptoms, and the highest prevalence for girls was a 3-fold increase for feeling worthless. This could be because the symptoms of depression and anxiety examined in this study are more in line with female symptoms than male symptoms, showing a higher mean and prevalence for girls. Also, parental sex does not differ in the influence on the offspring's depression and anxiety symptoms, and it could be because previous studies show that paternal influence is stronger in the postnatal stage which could equalize the influence of parental sex. Lastly, parental sex interaction with offspring is not enough of interaction to influence the offspring's depression and anxiety symptoms and there must be other factors."

be seen as an extension of evolutionary theory. This extension is twofold: I first use a framework called
the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis to ground what I call practices in the evolution of organisms, and I
then use the later Ludwig Wittgenstein’s ideas on meaning and language-games to ground concepts in
practices. The result is a model that explains the interdependencies between the evolutions of three
notions: organisms, practices, and concepts. In the last two chapters, I apply the model to change in
knowledge of logic, and of the notion of logical consequence in particular. In this application, I focus on
the logical theories of Aristotle and Chrysippus, and claim that these are grounded in the practices of
giving counterexamples, and of the contradiction, respectively."

genome plasticity, source designation, metadata annotation, problems with data, and
spatio-temporal dynamics are evaluated. These technical and biological problems are placed in
context of different phenotyping, genotyping and genotype-based microbial source attribution
approaches to give an intuitive overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the aforementioned
approaches. Agreeing with previous papers, we find that a combination of genotyping approaches is
the best way forward. However, WGS genotyping approaches require standardization before
universal application. We hope to highlight possible research directions, such as to what extent
genetic signals are associated with adaptation, and by proxy attributable to a source. Additionally, we
stressed the relevance of spatio-temporal data to expand source attribution capabilities."
"An analysis of the relationships between maladaptive humor styles, depression, and personal-level individualism","['Giapraki, Maria']","['Doosje, Sibe']",2022-04-14T00:00:35Z,EN,['maladaptive humor styles; self-defeating humor style; aggressive humor style; personal-level individualism; depression; model; adults; positive psychology'],Clinical Psychology,"The present study examined the relationship between maladaptive humor styles (namely the self-defeating and the aggressive humor style), personal-level individualism, and depression to develop a model of potential risk factors for depression. A cross-sectional design was applied, in which 650 adults between the ages of 18 and 65, with diverse cultural backgrounds and educational level, completed online questionnaires. The associations between these constructs were investigated using Pearson correlations (2-tailed), a hierarchical multiple regression, mediation, and moderation analyses. The findings indicated a significant positive correlation between the self-defeating humor style and depression as well as between the aggressive humor style and personal-level individualism. However, no other associations were found among the variables of interest. Therefore, even though this study could serve as a stepping-stone for future research or improve the effectiveness of positive psychology clinical interventions on depression, it cannot securely provide 
cross-cultural support for the theoretical structure of the hypothesized model."
Quantitative Methods for 3D Gastruloids Image Analysis,"['Longo, Andrea']","['Oudenaarden, Alexander van']",2022-04-15T00:00:40Z,EN,['Gastrulation; Human Gastruloids; CNN; Image Analysis; FOXA2; SOX17'],Science and Business Management,"The study of early developmental stages in humans was limited by technical difficulties and ethical concerns. As a consequence, the scientific community does not have an experimental system able to generate enough reliable data about human development. For this reason, new models need to be developed. Recently, multi lineage organoids were generated in vitro to model post-implantation events (~2 weeks post-fertilization). These 3D aggregates derived from human embryonic stem cells are called gastruloids because they mimic events of the early stages of gastrulation. Although the visualization of such samples produced informative results, the qualitative assessment of events remains a limitation intrinsic to the method. In this work, we describe a workflow useful to extract meaningful quantitative information from Z-stacks of human gastruloids. Performing nuclear segmentation with Cellpose, we identified 144,592 nuclei expressing FOXA2 and SOX17, two transcription factors involved in early development. Processing iteratively single optical sections of 23 gastruloids, we were able to measure markers intensity over time. Furthermore, combining tools in Fiji and custom functions in R, we recorded nuclear shape changes and cellular alignment events. The pipeline developed allows quantification of features which would have been only described by looking at the images. This study serves as a collection of open access tools for researchers to perform accurate image analysis from 3D digital images."

Peripheral neuroblastic tumors (pNTs) account for about 10% of pediatric malignancies. Their incidence is approximately ten cases per million children each year. They are highly heterogeneous and are classified based on morphological characteristics. Since 2018, the Princess Máxima Center routinely uses RNA-sequencing to detect fusion genes, one of the most common genomic alterations in pediatric cancers. Through our study we aim to refine tissue-based diagnosis as well as predict the outcome of pNT patients. We reviewed the morphology of frozen tumor tissue fragments from patients with neuroblastic tumors from which RNA was extracted. Based on this morphology review we created three groups: undifferentiated, differentiating and differentiated tumors and sought to determine whether there was a correlation between the morphology and the RNA-seq data of the samples. We then investigated the RNA-seq data of pNTs, neurofibromas and Schwannomas to observe the relation between the expression profile and the histology-based diagnosis. The expression profiles described a differentiation gradient, moving from benign differentiated tumors such as schwannomas and neurofibromas to malign undifferentiated tumors such as poorly differentiated neuroblastomas. Subsequently, we explored the expression level of MYCN throughout the pNT cohort and found a correlation between the MYCN expression level and the differentiation gradient. We then analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways in undifferentiated versus differentiated tumors and in MYCNA versus non-MYCNA-PDNBs. Overall, based on our cohort, we showed that pNTs, neurofibromas and Schwannomas cluster together by morphological diagnosis and follow a cellular differentiation gradient. Further, we showed that these gene sets are differentially expressed between undifferentiated and differentiated tumors as well as between MYCNA and non-MYCNA PDNBs. Combining our data with clinical follow-up data, may provide new avenues for prediction of prognosis and targeted treatment for patients with peripheral neuroblastic tumors."
The maintenance of the naive T cell pool during homeostasis is differently regulated in humans and wildling mice,"['Brouwers, Tamara']","['Tesselaar, K.']",2022-04-01T00:00:32Z,EN,['Naive T cell maintenance; TRECs; Thymic output; T cell proliferation; Wildling'],Infection and Immunity,"Understanding how naive T cells are maintained during healthy aging is important to unravel the effects of lymphopenic conditions on naive T cell dynamics. Naive T cells can be produced in two different ways: through production of naive T cells by the thymus or through peripheral division. The contribution of the thymus to naive T cell production can be quantified through the measurement of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). TRECs are episomal DNA circles, formed during rearrangement of T cell receptor (TCR) genes in both human and murine T cells. TRECs are stable, do not replicate during cell division and are exclusively from thymic origin.

As the TREC content of human naive T cells declines with age, it is thought that the human naive T cell pool is mainly maintained through peripheral division. However, the decline in TREC content could also be the result of a bias in the human naive T cell population that increases with age. Previously, when the TREC content of human naive T cells was measured, stem-cell like memory T cells (Tscm cells) were still included in the human naive T cell compartment. Relative to truly naive T cells, the TREC content of  Tscm cells is relatively low. This means that the inclusion of Tscm cells in the human naive T cell compartment could have resulted in an underestimation of the TREC content, increasing with age due to an expanding Tscm cell population. Hence, in this project, the TREC content of human truly naive T cells was quantified. Even with exclusion of Tscm cells, a similar decline in TREC content of truly naive T cells was observed, indicating that the human naive T cell compartment is truly maintained by peripheral division. It also appears that the thymus is more involved in the production of human CD8+ than CD4+ truly naive T cells.

In contrast to humans, the naive T cell pool in specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice is mostly maintained through thymic output. As it has been suggested that the level of pathogen exposure can directly influence naive T cell dynamics, the TREC content of naive T cells from wildlings, a special mouse model which immune phenotype is more similar to that of humans, was also quantified. Between the age of ten to twenty-nine weeks, the TREC content of naive T cells from wildlings remained relatively constant. These results indicate that the naive T cell pool in wildlings is, just like in SPF mice, mostly produced by the thymus. 

All these findings together show that the maintenance of naive T cells during homeostasis is differently regulated in mice and men. Where the human truly naive T cell compartment appears to be mainly maintained through peripheral division, naive T cells in mice are mostly produced by the thymus. Using the mouse as a direct model for humans should therefore be done with caution. Further study is required to explore what could explain this difference in naive T cell maintenance."
Against Overpopulation: A Critique of Environmental Malthusianism,"['Hansson, Ida']","['Colpani, Gianmaria']",2022-04-01T00:00:45Z,EN,['Overpopulation; Malthus; the Anthropocene; the Human'],Gender Studies (Research),"In this thesis I analyse the argument that there are “too many people” on Earth and that we need to reduce the world population. I trace how the argument has been used throughout history, starting with the work of Thomas Malthus in the late eighteenth century, touching on its application by colonial officials, eugenicists, biologists, conservationists and ecologists, and finally its application in the environmental movement in 1968 by Paul Ehrlich and others. Building on this historical analysis, I address how the overpopulation argument has been taken up by contemporary feminists, most notably by Donna Haraway. Through tracing this argument back to its origins in Malthusian thinking, eugenics, colonialism and antiblackness, I argue that despite being presented as a purely mathematical or scientific theory, the overpopulation argument is co-constituted with, and difficult to disconnect from, these troublesome ideologies. With these ideological origins, overpopulation discourse has a tendency to target specific populations as trouble-populations: the racialised and the poor. Further, by showing the link between contemporary overpopulation and climate change discourses, I argue that the Malthusian legacy in the contemporary Anthropocene narrative is the idea that people are the problem, and therefore a reduction of population growth is the solution. Framing climate change as a man-made problem in this way presents the ‘human’ as a universal category, concealing intra-human difference, which allows for the development of a climate change strategy focused on population management, birth rates, and reproduction. In order to stop reproducing Malthusian ideas in the climate change discussion today, we must start to question the concepts we think with. A key part of this work consists of refusing universalistic conceptions of the human, such as in the notion of ‘population’ itself."

Previous research on
pedestrian-robot interaction has looked at, for instance, the effect of robot velocity and anthropomorphism on pedestrian
behavior towards a robot, as well as people’s ethical concerns towards these robots. However, little is known about what
effect a clearly conveyed function of a robot has on behavior towards this robot. Therefore, a field study was done where
observations of pedestrians encountering a stationary mobile robot without a clear function were compared to observations
of pedestrians encountering a stationary Garbage cleaning robot. We found that, for pedestrians that encountered the
Garbage bot, the chance of ignoring that robot was higher compared to pedestrians encountering the robot with no
clear function. An additional finding was that women are more likely to ignore a mobile robot compared to men. The
findings have emphasized that companies would benefit from ensuring that their robot conveys a clear function. The clear
conveyance of the robot’s function decreases the likelihood of pedestrians interfering with the robot’s tasks. In addition, it
decreases the chance of pedestrians getting distracted by the mobile robot, therewith increasing overall road safety. Future
studies could conduct experiments with an autonomously driving robot, rather than a stationary one. These studies could
aim to investigate the behavior of the demographic groups for which the current study did not provide enough data, as
well as investigate how behavior towards mobile robots changes over time."

Each intersection is assessed based on research maturity, expected research growth, and level of policymaking impact. As such, this literature review identified three key intersection fields for the Directorate of Water and Soil to further investigate: firstly, monitoring and anomaly detection intersected with pipeline construction and maintenance. Secondly, network planning and optimization intersected with waterway safety and flooding. Thirdly, simulation and prediction intersected with waterway safety and flooding. Further research on many intersection fields is suggested, but especially regarding the aforementioned three."

Inequality and adaptation to Sea Level Rise under RCP4.5 until 2100: a study of adaptation strategies for vulnerable communities in India’s Ganga Delta,"['Budie, Thomas']","['Bailey, Ajay']",2022-04-06T00:00:33Z,EN,[],Sustainable Development,"This research focuses on adaptation strategies for vulnerable communities in the Indian Ganga Delta against projected sea level rise (SLR) under RCP4.5 until 2100 and how adaptation strategies can be designed to reduce SLR-related inequalities for these social groups. In general, societies can adapt to SLR-related threats in three ways: planned migration, managed retreat, accommodation, and “hold the line” through structural, non-structural or ecosystem-based adaptation approaches. Although these can be combined, sometimes choices have to be made between multiple options. Landless people, who are predominantly agricultural labourers, are likely forced to migrate due to tidal erosion of mud embarkments and land degradation by saline water intrusion. For these people, SLR poses a significant risk, and it is already happening today. Other social groups such as women and older adults also tend to have higher vulnerability to hazardous events. SLR shows how an environmental threat can have an uneven impact in terms of severity and urgency on certain groups and how it can cause certain livelihoods to become even more precarious than they already are. For this reason, it is important to see which measures have been adopted in the past, what the current situation is, what the drivers behind SLR-induced inequalities are and how adaptation strategies can be designed to prevent or reduce this. Hence, the main research question is the following: “What are the adaptation strategies for vulnerable communities in the Ganga Delta in India for projected Sea Level Rise under RCP4.5 until 2100 and how can it reduce potential SLR-induced inequalities”
By looking at a mean SLR of 0.55 meter (which is the IPCC’s intermediate projection under RCP4.5) combined with storm surge sea level heights of 4,5 and 6,5 meters, this study has applied geographic information systems (GIS) to map which areas in West Bengal India will be affected by SLR. These maps show critical flood- prone areas in and around the Sandurban region, including urban hotspots near the banks of several large rivers. Furthermore, this research did a review of recent literature on SLR-induced inequalities. It identified several corridors that increase vulnerability and inequality by reproducing exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of vulnerable communities. Subsequently, the LASI wave-1 survey dataset from 2018 was used for a vulnerability indicator assessment of women, older adults and landless agricultural groups. Lacking geo-codes of the respondents (which are yet to be released) limited this analysis, as it prevented an integration of geospatial vulnerability variables. At last, a literature-based analysis of recent and potential future adaptation strategies was done, which concluded that a mix of soft and hard approaches while incentivizing long-term migration will potentially protect vulnerable communities the most."
Regeneration at the Coast: Benefits for Community and Climate - A New Framework for Impact Assessment of Mangrove Restoration,"['Zoons, Thyrza']","['Vuuren, Detlef van']",2022-04-06T00:00:40Z,EN,['sustainability; framework; blue carbon; accounting; mangrove; restoration; bonaire; safe and just operating space; planetary boundaries; Sustainable Development Goals'],Sustainable Development,"To close carbon emission gaps and achieve the Paris Climate Agreement, mangrove restoration has 
emerged as a potential solution. These forests are known for their exceptional carbon sequestration 
rates, but the attention for mangrove restoration and similar climate solutions in the marine and 
coastal environment is limited as compared to their terrestrial counterparts. By broadening our scope
from a sole focus on the climate mitigation potential of these aptly coined ‘blue carbon’ solutions, 
towards the appreciation of their full range of benefits, the case for marine nature regeneration 
becomes more compelling.

In this thesis, I developed a new impact assessment framework for mangrove restoration, that includes 
indicators for sustainability impact as well as indicators for effective implementation. The framework 
is based on the concept of a Safe and Just Operating Space and is the first to translate this concept to 
the intervention level. Based on expert interviews and literature review, it explicitly considers the 
impact of the natural system as well as the impact arising from human interference. Altogether, 30 
impact dimensions have been identified, underpinning the fact that benefits of mangrove restoration 
go far beyond its climate mitigation potential alone. This is complemented by an overview of 
challenges and facilitating conditions that typically influence the implementation success of mangrove 
restoration efforts. 

The feasibility of local application of these frameworks is assessed through a case study on mangrove 
restoration on Bonaire. A selection of impact dimensions in this context is discussed, but data required 
for quantification was lacking. The case study score on indicators for effective implementation left only 
three indicators with considerable space for improvement. Mangrove restoration as performed on 
Bonaire may therefore provide useful lessons for efforts elsewhere. An additional community 
perception study suggested a difference in apprehension of mangrove ecosystem services between 
different demographic groups that exist on the island. It also showed how active engagement with 
restoration improved people’s understanding of the value of mangrove forest.

The ‘Impact on Safe and Just Operating Space’ framework and the associated indicators for effective 
implementation presented here, provide a novel, more all-encompassing approach for impact 
assessment of mangrove restoration and may well be applied to other nature-based solutions. This 
thesis manifests a trans-disciplinary perspective on the meaning of sustainability impact, engaging 
both field practitioners, various stakeholders, and the local community. Further research should 
provide a quantitative analysis of mangrove restoration potential on a local scale, including 
counteracting disservices."
How the asparagus industry has led to sustainability and socio-economic issues the region of Ica,"['Lau, ka-wing']","['Westen, Guus van']",2022-04-06T00:00:43Z,EN,['Asparagus; Sustainability; Ica Valley; Peruvian asparagus industry'],Sustainable Development,"This research analyzes the Peruvian asparagus industry and its influence on the access of water and land in the Ica region.
Firstly the actors and value chain were analyzed. The public actors consist of the water authorities and COPRI. The water authorities are the ANA, ALA, local water authorities and the Junta, who regulate and enforce. Private actors are investors, agro-exporters, agricultural workers, and small farmers. The investors and agro-exporters are considered wealthy, while the workers and small farmers have a low socio-economic status (Schwarz, 2016). The Peruvian asparagus industry contains the agro-exporters’ value chain, and the small farmers’ value chain. The agro-exporter’s value chain is fully integrated and optimized (Schwarz, 2016). The chain of the small/medium farmers is not integrated and each activity is done by a different actor.
Different regulations were analyzed to answer the second sub-question. The most important regulations are the trade regulations, water regulations, and land ownership regulations. Trade regulations have allowed foreign investors to acquire land and water. Water regulation allowed an unlimited extraction of water. Land regulations allowed for large land acquisition and agricultural activities (Gomes, 2015). 
Sustainability issues in Ica were analyzed to answer the third sub-question. Water scarcity issues are affecting Ica’s ecosystems due to agricultural water extraction (Hepworth, 2010). Surface water is used, but the reliability is low as rivers are dried up during the dry periods. Competition leads to pressure to reduce production costs and to increase crop quality (Diaz Rios, 2018). Agro-exporters have gained a preference position which creates inequality between them and the peruvian people. 
The fourth sub-question looks at socio-economic issues, such as the underpayment and low working conditions for workers. Despite a low unemployment rate, many workers are at risk for losing their jobs, caused by unfair labor contracts. Covid-19 related issues have exposed how much power the employers have over their workers, where employers forced their workers to resume working despite health hazards and poor hygiene situations. 
The fifth sub-question is answered through analyzing sustainability strategies. Sustainable resource use strategies include water use efficiency, crop switching, regulation of water use, aquifer replenishments, and water import. Working conditions strategies include regulating working conditions and wages, and supporting labor unions (Adam, 2018). 
In order to answer the main research question and to improve the access to land and water in the Ica region, four groups should be helped. The small asparagus farmers, the population of Ica, and the indegenous communities are best helped with better and more secure access to water and land. The agricultural workers are best helped with better wages and working conditions."
The Effect of Contralesional cTBS on Motor Network Activity and Connectivity in Stroke Patients Assessed with fMRI and Dynamic Causal Modeling,"['Innemee, Mira']","['Dijkhuizen, Rick']",2022-04-02T00:00:37Z,EN,[],Neuroscience and Cognition,"Hemiparesis of the upper limb is the most common cause of disability after stroke. The exact mechanism underlying spontaneous upper limb recovery is still unclear, and more effective therapies for optimizing stroke rehabilitation are required. Following stroke, excessive inhibition from the contralesional (CL) primary motor cortex (M1) may additionally impair activation in the ipsilesional (IL) M1. This in turn may contribute to motor impairment. Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) applied over the CL M1 is believed to suppress its activation and as a result may improve motor function. The effective connectivity between both M1s can be estimated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM). This study aimed to investigate the effect of cTBS applied over the CL M1 on bilateral M1 activation and effective connectivity between the M1s, and whether this correlated with motor function. Subacute stroke patients received real or sham cTBS treatment, and underwent fMRI scanning one week after treatment, and three and six months after stroke onset. Additionally, motor function tests were performed. M1 activation was assessed by the percent signal change and changes in effective connectivity were estimated by DCM of the motor network. No significant effects of real cTBS treatment on both CL M1 and IL M1 activation were found, although a trend for IL M1 activation was visible. In addition, IL M1 activation correlated positively with motor function, indicating that this might play an important role in stroke recovery. No differences in effective connectivity between bilateral M1s were found, although variability between patients was high. Taken together, more research is needed to reveal the exact role of effective connectivity between bilateral M1s in stroke recovery, and to establish the effect of cTBS applied over the CL M1 on bilateral M1 activation and effective connectivity."
Analysis of the Dutch Preferentiebeleid,"['Grupstra, Renske']","['Mantel-Teeuwisse, A.K.']",2022-04-07T00:00:32Z,EN,[],Drug Innovation,"Generally speaking, medicines can be classified into those that are patented, meaning that they are protected and can only be sold under a specific name by a certain company, and those that are off-patent, meaning that various companies may produce medication with the same ingredients and therapeutic effect. Medicines from the latter category are referred to as generics. More often than not, generics are cheaper then patented medicines. For this reason it is in a country’s best interest to try and increase the use of generics in their health care system. Additionally, countries always aim to lower prices of drugs and keep them low, which also goes for generics. For these reasons, various policies exist to regulate pricing and reimbursement of medicines, including generics. This analysis is focused on the Dutch policy in place for pricing and reimbursement of generics, which, in Dutch, is known as the preferentiebeleid. 
	In a nutshell, insurance companies in the Netherlands can use the preferentiebeleid to determine which specific generics from a group of similar medicines are reimbursed. To do so, insurance companies appoint the cheapest generics as preferent, and community pharmacists are to dispense these preferent generics to patients. Important to note is that each insurance company creates their own list of preferent generics, meaning that they all implement the preferentiebeleid in a different way. 
This policy analysis describes how, after about 15 years of implementation of this policy, the preferentiebeleid  was able to lower prices and increase the use of generics in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, it was also found that this policy had unintended, negative effects: increased drug shortages and frequent drug switches for patients. A stakeholder analysis showed that these unintended effects negatively affect stakeholders like pharmacists, as their workload is increased, and patients, as drug switches confuses, or even angers them. 
	In addition, this analysis compared the preferentiebeleid to other policies for pricing and reimbursement that are in place in European countries to see whether the Dutch policy would be implementable in other countries or if the Dutch can learn from the successes of other policies. Literature demonstrated that systems similar to the Dutch policy are also able to lower prices of generics and increase their use, but that these other countries suffer less from negative effects like increased drug shortages or medicine switches. Suggested adjustments for the preferentiebeleid based on successes from other countries include making several generics preferent instead of just one per group of similar medicines, and generalizing the preferentiebeleid  for all patients regardless of their insurance company.  Informal contact with a community pharmacists confirmed that these suggestions are in line with the wishes of pharmacists. 
	Overall, this policy analysis shows that the Dutch preferentiebeleid is successfully fulfilling its aim to lower generic prices and increase their use, but that it requires adjustments in order to be sustainable in the Netherlands as pharmacists and patients currently experience negative consequences of this policy."

The effect of pharmacist telephone counselling (PTC) on patients initiating cardiovascular medication,"['Rieter, Quirine']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-04-26T00:00:32Z,EN,[],Farmacie,"Background: Initiating new chronic cardiovascular medication can be difficult, especially with different healthcare providers and the appliance to a home setting. Therefore, pharmacist telephone counseling (PTC), where a new chronic user of cardiovascular medication receives a phone call within the first two weeks of the first prescription fill, can offer a great benefit for these patients at the start of their new therapy. In the Netherlands, no such service was available until now. 
Objective To evaluate the effect of PTC on patient reported outcome measurements (PROMs) in patients with new chronic cardiovascular medication.
Methods: A descriptive study was performed in 14 Dutch community pharmacies and one outpatient pharmacy in Almere, The Netherlands. In total, three patient groups participated in study: the PTC  group (n=406), the non-PTC group (n=455) and the usual care group (n=189). In the PTC group, selected patients by the outpatient pharmacy received a PTC from the community pharmacist within 2 weeks after drug prescription. One day after the PTC two questionnaires about medication understanding and use Self-Efficacy (MUSE) and Satisfaction with information About Medicines Scale (SIMS) were conducted with the patients. The non-PTC group did not receive a pharmacist counseling and did not answered the SIMS and MUSE questionnaires. In the usual care group, patients received the questionnaires three months prior to the start of the intervention.
Results: Out of the 406 patients who received a PTC, 71.2% reported one or more problems with their new cardiovascular medication during PTC. Moreover, the pharmacist provided 75.1% of the PTC patients with recommendations. Additionally, the results of the SIMS and MUSE both showed a higher score in the PTC group, respectively 11.68 vs 9.28 on a 15-point SIMS score and 85.8% vs 66.9% scored ‘Good’ on the MUSE questionnaire. 
Conclusion: The PTC showed a great number of problems patients still have after their first cardiovascular prescription. Next to this, the pharmacist was able to provide three-quarter of the patients with (unasked) recommendations about their medication. This led to higher scores in the questionnaires about satisfaction on received medication information and medication understanding and self-efficacy."

signaling pathways in tomato which involves the activation of jasmonic acid and the release of 
volatile organic compounds. Tomato and its relatives also possess a wide range of glandular 
and non-glandular trichomes types. Glandular trichomes are specialized hairs which originate 
from the plants surface, capable of producing and releasing varying secondary metabolites. 
Many of the wild tomato species are more resistant to insect pests than cultivated tomatoes due 
to an enhanced production of resistance-related metabolites, such as acyl sugars, terpenes, and 
methyl ketones. Dissecting the systemin-mediated hormonal signaling pathways and trichome 
mediated defense responses in tomato will provide valuable information to improve future 
breeding strategies for new tomato varieties and to engineer tomato plants with enhanced insect 
resistance. Here, we review recent advances in molecular research on the role of systemic 
signaling and phytohormone pathways in the tomato defense response against insect herbivores, 
with a focus on systemin mediated signaling. Next, we highlight the role of different trichomes 
in tomato and its relatives and summarize the role of several important trichome-produced 
compounds in tomato."
Clinical pharmacist’s recommendations at a psychiatric unit: acceptance rate of psychotropic versus nonpsychotropic medication recommendations.,"['Smorenburg, Kaylee']","['Egberts, A.C.G.']",2022-04-27T09:00:26Z,EN,"['psychiatry, acceptance rate, psychotropic, nonpsychotropic, medication recommendations']",Farmacie,"Psychiatric comorbidity has a negative influ-ence on prognosis.

The primary outcome measurement was to compare the acceptance rate between psychotropic medication (PM) recommenda-tions and nonpsychotropic medication (non-PM) recommendations. Secondary outcome measures were to evaluate differences in in-tervention type, medication-related problems, and inpatient versus outpatient medication. Descriptive data-analysis was used. A total of 239 interventions were made by the pharmacist. The overall acceptance rate was 88.7%. The acceptance rate for PM rec-ommendations was 83,8% and for non-PM recommendations was 94,5%. Differences were found in intervention type, initiated drug (p = 0.025), and medication-related problems, untreated indication (p = 0.001), adverse drug reaction (p = 0.050), and drug use without indication (p = 0.013). Nonpsychotropic medication recommenda-tions were more likely to be accepted by phy-sicians at the psychiatric unit. In collaboration with the psychiatric physician, a pharmacist can play an important role in optimizing pharmacotherapy and patient care."

Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Municipal Solid Waste Incineration by Carbon Capture and Enhanced Recycling,"['Leeuw, Maarten de']","['Kramer, Gert Jan']",2022-05-10T23:00:26Z,EN,"['Decarbonisation, Greenhousegas, Climate change, Recycling, Carbon Capture, CCS, CCU, Waste, MSW, Municipal Solid Waste']",Energy Science,"The Dutch waste incineration industry is one of the most efficient in the world, extracting 36% of the
energy in the waste as useful heat or electricity on average, while reducing the volume of the solid
municipal waste by around 90% (Rijkswaterstaat, 2020). Consequentially, the industry is also one of
the Netherlands’ largest emitters of greenhouse gases. In 2018, the industry emitted 7.5 Mt of CO2-
equivalent emissions, of which 3.0 Mt was non-biogenic in origin. In order to achieve the climate
ambitions of the Dutch government of 60% GHG emission reduction and net-zero emissions in 2050,
the waste incineration industry is under pressure to reduce its emissions (Rijksoverheid, 2018).

This research, conducted in the context of the MIDDEN project, attempts to compare different
technologies, configurations and pathways for the reduction of GHG emissions related to the
currently incinerated waste stream in the Netherlands. The two main categories that were
investigated were carbon capture technologies and enhanced recycling technologies. Emission
reduction options are compared on the basis of their technology readiness level, potential feedstock,
total CO2 emission reduction potential and estimated CO2 avoidance cost. The net emission reduction
potential is estimated by an ex-ante comparative life cycle assessment. Validation of the results is
done via a Monte Carlo analysis of uncertainty.

Carbon capture for waste incinerators is already an established technology, which is currently
applied at two major waste incinerators in the Netherlands. This report identified three
configurations for carbon capture technologies and assessed their potential for emission reduction
and associated cost. CO2 avoidance cost ranged from €159-224 per tonne CO2, depending on the
configuration chosen. Furthermore, policy issues that hinder implementation of carbon capture are
addressed in the discussion.

Enhanced recycling aims at decreasing the total volume of incinerated waste, while reducing net
GHG emissions. Enhanced recycling technologies identified by this research with the potential of
reducing GHG emissions are waste plastic pyrolysis, EPS solvolysis, PET depolymerisation and
gasification of municipal solid waste. Findings include limited total GHG emission reduction potential
for enhanced recycling (154 kt CO2 annually) compared to carbon capture technologies (5,130 kt
annually). A configuration combining recycling (gasification) and CCS was found to result in 1,043 kt
CO2 reduction annually. In part, this is due to the limited availability of the feedstock for these
processes. Another factor is the emissions from the alternative processes themselves. CO2 avoidance
cost results for enhanced recycling technologies were inconclusive, as uncertainty was found to be
too large.

Significant short-term CO2 emission reduction is most likely achieved through large-scale
implementation of carbon capture technologies in combination with waste incineration and/or
gasification. Carbon capture and storage proves to be the most potent short-term solution to waste
incineration GHG emissions. In the long-term, GHG emission reduction must be achieved by full
separation of the plastic waste from the residual fraction and subsequent recycling of this plastic
material. The methods and practices to achieve this, however, are not available at this time."
Soundscapes of migrant dramaturgy in relation to spectatorship,"['Porto, Andreia Porto']","['Wan, Evelyn']",2022-03-09T00:00:32Z,EN,['Migrant Dramaturgy; Performance; Sound; Spectatorship'],"Contemporary Theatre, Dance and Dramaturgy","Migration is a worldwide phenomenon that has significantly impacted societies across the globe, creating culturally diverse communities. This work focuses on the representation of migrants’ point of view in contemporary performance and aims to explore how sound is used by migrant artists to communicate their experiences with migration in their performances. At a more specific level, this research investigates the importance of sound in migrant dramaturgy and how it invites the spectator to have a bodily experience through listening referring to being a foreigner. As a methodology, this thesis consists of a theoretical framework mentioning key authors on this subject such as Yana Meerzon, Katharina Pewny, Mieke Bal, Natasha Davis, Lynne Kendrick, George Home-Cook and a dramaturgical analysis following the relational approach proposed by Groot Nibbelink and Merx. The main focus of the analysis is on performances created by migrant artists. To achieve that, I chose two case studies: Intern Terrains by Natasha Davis, a Croatian-born performer and visual artist based in London, and Cosmic A* by Charlie Prince, a Lebanese performer and choreographer based in-between Amsterdam and Beirut. In this sense, by analysing dramaturgical structures and strategies regarding the performances’ composition, spectatorship, and social context references, with this work I intend to contribute to the performance studies field, bringing the spotlight to the artwork produced by migrant artists and discussions about migration from their point of view. I hope that my research contributes to the contemporary art field promoting recognition of what migrant artists have to say. Their voices play a more important role in promoting different ways to share their stories using sound, as well as inviting spectators to reflect on migration in a more empathetic way by making them experience a fragment of migrant life through experience."
"Integrating Ground Penetrating Radar data in a GIS to detect unmarked graves via a Convolutional Neural Network framework for 3D point cloud interpretation - A case study at the Jewish Cemetery in The Hague,
The Netherlands","['Riesner, Christian']","['Externe beoordelaar - External assesor,']",2022-05-11T00:00:39Z,EN,['GIS; GPR; point cloud; deep-learning; grave; classification; ArcGIS; detection; subsurface; model'],Geographical Information Management and Applications (GIMA),"The Jewish cemetery in The Hague is a listed national monument of The Netherlands and is a document of the Jewish heritage in the area. The site is occupied by more than 10.000 people buried there. Only 2.860 can be located on the ground as they are marked with a gravestone on their surface top. The spatial positions of the remaining unmarked burial locations are of high interest to cemetery management and the Jewish community. As a physical inventory is not possible, non-invasive methods are preferred. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a technology that has been successfully applied to detect sub-surface features. A survey with multiple sensors, including GPR, was undertaken on two sample areas of the cemetery. The conventional method to analyse the collected data sets is the interpretation of vertical and horizontal visualisations. This method required expert knowledge.
An alternative approach is to integrate the GPR data into a Geographic Information System (GIS) in the form of a 3D-point cloud. The data assessment was supported by applying the deep learning algorithm, PointCNN, that performs an automated classification of the points to segment the burial locations as features of interest. In this research, various classification models were created, applied, and evaluated to their usability. Furthermore, additional data sets were combined with the classified point clouds to incorporate more information to identify the unmarked burials.
The applied method highlights the advantages of a GIS for this spatial analytical task and reveals some vulnerable points in the application of deep learning. Therefore, the workflow in this research project will have to undergo adaptations as recommended at the end of the report."
Hotspot testing of a shade resilient smart photovoltaic panel,"['Beerling, Boyd']","['Sark, Wilfried van']",2022-05-10T23:00:30Z,EN,"['photovoltaic, hotspots, shade']",Energy Science,"To be able to prevent some future natural disasters for nature, wildlife and humans reduction of greenhouse gases is needed as these are the source of human-induced climate change. The energy sector is one of the main emitters of the two most important greenhouse gases: methane and CO2. Electricity for buildings and the industry are large sources of these. Solar photovoltaic is an interesting alternative and renewable option for electricity production. However, hotspots from partial-shading are currently a major problem for PV panels as these lower electricity problems and can result in damage of the panel. Many techniques are tried or currently applied, but hotspots are still occurring. By Golroodbari et al. (2019) an alternative PV panel structure was proposed in which the PV cells are optimized per group of ten instead of per module or per multiple modules. In this research the module is tested wired smart or in series to be able to make a comparison. 
Two setups were made: one using halogen lights and one using LED lights to lower the chance that the light source was reason for certain test results. Tests endured multiple hours and an infrared image was made every five minutes to check the module for hotspots. Also the I and V data were measured for further analysis if hotspots occurred. Furthermore, a comparable module was tested to exclude the option of no hotspots occurring due to the adjustments made to make the PV module smart. 
A total of 10 hotspots were found spread over two test round which were both in series. No hotspots were found in the smart PV panel test rounds. However, the irradiation intensity for both test setups was not very high with a maximum of 340W/m2. But, as hotspots occurred in this research it is expected that this did not affect the test results. So, it can be concluded that the smart PV panel proposed by Golroodbari et al. (2019) is hotspots resilient under indoor testing conditions. Additionally, recommended follow-up research would be outdoor testing, but current results are already expected to result in market interest."
Validity and Reliability of the BSQ in Saudi Arabia,"['Loos, Ida']","['Melisse, B.']",2022-05-13T00:00:32Z,EN,"['Body Shape Questionnaire, Body Dissatisfaction, Validity, Reliability, Saudi Arabia']",Clinical Psychology,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties, validity, and reliability of a Saudi Arabian version of the Body Shape Questionnaire as a screening tool for body dissatisfaction in the Saudi Arabian population. An additional aim was to test the Saudi versions of the BSQ-14 and the BSQ-8C short version. 
Methods: The sample consisted of Saudi Arabian males and females (N= 873). All participants completed the Saudi BSQ. The Saudi versions of the BSQ-34, BSQ-14, and BSQ-8C were tested on their internal consistency, concurrent validity, concordance rate, and discriminative validity. The latter was measured by conducting a ROC analysis including an AUC using the EDE-Q shape concern scale as a comparative measure. 
Results: Statistical analyses revealed that the BSQ-34, BSQ-14, and BSQ-8C are valid and reliable measurement tools. All versions of the BSQ showed high AUC scores. For the BSQ-34 an optimal cut-off was determined at 81.5. In the current sample, 44.8% scored above this cut-off. For the original cut-off score of 110, in this sample 23.9% scored above. For the BSQ-8C the optimal cut-off was found at 21.5 and for the BSQ-14 the optimal cut-off was determined at 38.5.  
Discussion: The Saudi versions of the BSQ-34, the BSQ-14, and the BSQ-8C are suitable measurement tools for body dissatisfaction in a Saudi-Arabian population. As body dissatisfaction is viewed as a risk factor for the development of eating disorders, the assessment of body dissatisfaction with reliable tools is an integral part to determine individuals at risk for eating disorders and leaves room for preventive steps."

It aims to explore how foster youth and professionals in foster care experience participation according to Article 12 of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child and what opportunities for improvement they formulate in this regard. Whilst children and professionals in this study indicated that it is important for children to have a say in decisions that affect children's lives, the extent to which this occurred was limited. In general, among professionals, the age of children played a large role in whether they are involved in the decisions made about their lives. In addition, it appeared that lack of time and high workload hindered children's participation. Children and youth in this study expressed frustration that they were sometimes not listened to or that they were not informed until after a decision was made. Listening was also about having conversations with professionals; for example, the children in this study preferred to have conversations about their future rather than their past or about how they are doing rather than what happened. The children and youth also expressed frustration at constantly having to deal with different professionals to whom they constantly had to retell their story. Of the suggestions for improvement, the most important were to encourage asking children (regardless of age) for their opinions, promote informing children before decisions are made, encourage being honest with children about their situation (do not talk around the truth), and let children decide what they want to talk about."
Comparing hand-centric designs for a menu selection task in augmented reality,"['Kemenade, Willem van']","['Hardman, Lynda']",2022-07-15T00:00:51Z,EN,['GMT; HCI; Design study; Augmented Reality; Human-centred design; Hand-centric design;'],Game and Media Technology,"Selection in Augmented Reality (AR) is a common task that can be used to, for example, select an item from a menu. There are many approaches to creating a selection interaction such as controller, gesture or gaze input, each having their pros and cons. Independent of any particular implementation, the interaction should be fast and usable since it is a common task. Furthermore, the cognitive load should be kept as low as possible for the best user experience.

A typical menu in augmented and virtual reality is a window with buttons fixed in virtual space, which forces the user to keep in mind where the menu is located or forced to relocate to use it. One type of design that solves this is hand-centric design. This design anchors objects in the virtual space around the user’s hand which allows the interaction to always be in the same relative location to the user. 

We created a finger based (SwipePie) and a palm based design (The Widget Pallet). These designs were implemented in a prototype AR system called DatAR and evaluated using a human-centred design approach. DatAR is part of a research endeavour to explore interacting with large numbers of neuroscience publications. DatAR provided an environment to implement the designs and provide suitable tasks for evaluating them. Our goal is both to improve the selection interaction in the DatAR system, and to create a general solution that can be used for similar systems.

The results from a pilot study indicated that participants preferred the Widget Pallet designs over the SwipePie designs. A second evaluation examined how the Widget Pallet designs compared based on our three criteria: speed, cognitive load and usability. The results indicate no statistical difference on all criteria."

The research question is therefore formulated as follows: do small firms have higher abnormal stock returns than large firms in the Dutch stock market? The sample consists of all firms listed on the Dutch stock exchange Euronext Amsterdam from 2008 to 2021, divided into ten value-weighted yearly-adjusted portfolios. After the risk adjustment for the non-synchronous trading bias, stock returns are observed with an OLS regression based on the extended Three-Factor Model. The Three-Factor Model is extended with a liquidity factor and the dividend yield. The empirical results of this thesis indicate the existence of the small firm effect and the January effect in the Dutch stock market, but only for the smallest decile of firms. The smallest decile of firms in the Dutch stock market has persistently higher risk-adjusted returns than large firms, but the cause is still largely unexplained."
The Netherlands as a Cartel Damages Hub and Private Law Enforcement Paradise?,"['Wessel, Niels']","['Jaremba, Urszula']",2022-07-15T00:00:44Z,EN,['cartel damages claims; forum shopping; The Netherlands; Germany; The United Kingdom; private enforcement; competition law'],Law and Economics,"Private enforcement of competition law is organized under non-contractual liability (tort) law, which is structured very differently across EU Member States and differs substantially on various rules and aspects. Due to the differences in the substantive and procedural law of Member States, and also possibly the institutional structure of their court’s system, some national regimes have emerged which allow for a more attractive setting to claim damages as a result of a competition law infringement. Hence, the phenomenon of forum shopping is induced, in which regimes are specifically selected by claimants in order to generate the highest chance of damages compensation.

This master thesis sets out to discover what elements of the legal and judicial systems of the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom lead to their repute as preferred countries for cartel damages actions in the literature. It scrutinizes the Netherlands in particular and examines to what extent the Dutch forum is, in reality, in line with the literature's claims. Hence, the main research question asked in this thesis is: To what extent is the Netherlands perceived as a preferred country for private enforcement of cartel damages claims in the EU and what elements of the Dutch legal and judicial system or other factors and incentives may influence and determine this preference?

To provide an answer to this research question, semi-structured qualitative interviews with collective redress organizations, practicing lawyers and an experienced judge have been conducted. These interviews formed an essential element of this thesis as they have provided the means to gather data from the practical field about the relevant factors that induce forum shopping in the Netherlands. From the interviews, it became apparent that the Netherlands is a preferred country for cartel damages actions and that the distinguished elements are mostly in line with the literature's view. The analysis of this thesis has shown that Netherlands’ preference is primarily influenced and determined by (1) its extensive regime for collective redress, (2) its low costs of litigation and limited financial risk, (3) the high number of companies in the Netherlands and the willingness of Dutch courts to adopt jurisdiction, (4) the experience, competence and quality of judges, (5) the role of lawyers, claim vehicles and litigation funders in bringing cases to Dutch courts, (6) the efficient and practical approach of Dutch courts, and (7) practical aspects such as submitting evidence electronically."

Theory: Hypotheses were derived from the Buffer theory and other more recent scientific literature. Three hypotheses were derived, with the first expecting that higher levels of social support will result in higher levels of one’s mental well-being. Hypothesis two and three focused on the moderation effect of age and gender. Methods: The study consist of national data (n = 2775). To filter out possible confounds, level of education and level of psychical impairment were added to the multiple regression analyses. Results: Experienced social support has a significant positive effect on the level of mental well-being when controlling for the factors of age, gender, level of physical impairment and level of educational degree. No significant interaction effects were founds, meaning that there is no support found for moderating effects of age or gender. Discussion: This study has shown that those experiencing high levels of social support from their informal network (family or friends) are better off when it comes to mental well-being. Receiving support social from others could thereby encounter the growing waiting lists in mental healthcare. Future research is advised to include different forms of social support in their analysis to see whether there are differences in which forms of support people use or experience."

Prior research shows deviance from expected results based on key work on beauty premiums and physical attractiveness. By exposing the underlying mechanisms through which attractiveness influences the process of acquiring funding for entrepreneurial ventures, this research aims to explain this dissonance. Using data acquired from an online experiment on investors, we analyze investor behavior using main effects models, multiple regression and causal mediation analysis. This research finds that the beauty premium only exists for female entrepreneurs, that this female beauty premium only influences the initial decision to invest or not and can help in closing observed gender gaps in entrepreneurship. No evidence can be identified for biasing of the amount invested or the existence of a male beauty premium, inconsistent with the results of previous research. These findings can be explained by characteristics of investor ‘gut feel’ and the context specifity of the beauty premium, as well as dual processing theories."

While different methods exist to identify RPA candidate tasks, they lack in providing objective evidence on why to automate that candidate. Such objective evidence can be gathered by applying process mining techniques to gain insights into the performance of a process or task. Although this has multiple advantages, it can be time-consuming to analyze all potential processes. By adding a qualitative check before the  analysis, time and effort are saved because process mining is only applied to relevant processes. A literature review of existing methods was conducted to identify relevant criteria and method components.  I synthesized these into a framework for identifying and prioritizing suitable RPA candidate tasks: the Prioritized List of Suitable Tasks (PLOST) Framework. The framework includes both qualitative and quantitative criteria. It focuses on high- as well as low-level processes, while also taking into account a customized automation strategy.  A case study was conducted to evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of the PLOST Framework, and thinking-aloud experiments to evaluate the usability, practicality, and completeness. This resulted in adjustments to the framework that were subsequently incorporated into an enhanced PLOST+ Framework."

heeft. Daarnaast is een emo go/no go task gedaan om de emotieherkenning te meten. Hiermee
kan de d-prime worden berekend. De d-prime geeft een indicatie van de vaardigheid om
correct een emotie te herkennen. Hoe hoger de d-prime hoe beter iemand emoties kan
herkennen. Door het uitvoeren van meerdere enkelvoudige regressieanalyses is onderzocht in
hoeverre CU traits samenhangen met problemen in emotieherkenning bij jongeren. In dit

rekenprestaties zijn gemeten met de citotoets Rekenen-Wiskunde Eind groep 4 en Eind groep 5.
Gedragsmatig functioneren is gemeten door de afname van de Cool5-18 vragenlijst bij de
groepsleerkracht van de participanten. Uit dit onderzoek is gebleken dat positief gedragsmatig
functioneren een significante zwakke positieve voorspeller is van rekenprestaties en dat positief
gedragsmatig functioneren geen significante voorspeller is van rekenprestaties over tijd, nadat er
gecontroleerd is op eerdere rekenprestaties. Eerdere rekenprestaties blijken een significante
sterke voorspeller te zijn van latere rekenprestaties. Concluderend is gedragsmatig functioneren
een significante voorspeller van rekenprestaties die niet voortduurt over tijd en wordt de relatie
tussen gedragsmatig functioneren en rekenprestaties niet gemodereerd door sekse."
De ene bestuurder is de andere niet: over het samenspel tussen bestuurscultuur en bestuursstijl,"['Corbeek, Eefje']","['Binnema, H.A.']",2022-07-15T00:00:56Z,NL,['bestuurskunde; bestuurscultuur; gemeente; lokaal bestuur; bestuursstijl'],Bestuur en beleid,"In dit onderzoek is onderzocht hoe bestuurscultuur en bestuursstijl zich tot elkaar verhouden op gemeentelijk niveau. Bij vier gemeenten is gekeken hoe collegeleden het samenspel tussen stijl en cultuur beschouwen. De data hiervoor is verzameld via semigestructureerde interviews, een bestuursstijlentest, documentenanalyse en het houden van focusgroepen. Dit onderzoek bouwt voort op de recente heropleving van de wetenschappelijke interesse in lokale bestuursculturen. Het kijkt verder dan bestuurscultuur alleen en onderzoekt de relatie met een ander relevant concept, namelijk bestuursstijl. Aan de hand van twee theoretische typologieën worden deze complexe begrippen meetbaar gemaakt. Bovendien wordt in dit onderzoek gewerkt met een integrale manier van het bestuderen van bestuurscultuur, waarbij bestuurskundig en historisch onderzoek gecombineerd worden.

Allereerst bleek uit de resultaten dat de individuele bestuursstijlen van bestuurders niet zozeer afhankelijk zijn van de gemeentelijke bestuurscultuur, maar eerder van de persoonlijkheid van de bestuurder, de functie, de portefeuille of de opgave waarmee diegene aan de slag moet. Het is daardoor niet mogelijk om te spreken van een bepaald type bestuurder dat werkzaam is in een specifieke bestuurscultuur. Desalniettemin gedijen sommige bestuursstijlen beter in een bepaalde cultuur dan andere. Het onderzoek wijst uit dat er een verschil bestaat tussen de individuele bestuursstijlen en de overkoepelende stijl van besturen in een college van Burgemeester en Wethouders. Deze collegestijl lijkt meer verbonden te zijn met de bestaande bestuurscultuur dan de individuele stijlen. Zodra deze overkoepelende collegestijl niet goed aansluit bij de bestaande bestuurscultuur dan kunnen er botsingen ontstaan.

De kans dat er een botsing ontstaat tussen cultuur en stijl is ook groter op het moment dat er ineens veel bestuurders van buiten de gemeente benoemd worden. Deze bestuurders zijn dan namelijk niet voorafgaand aan de benoeming gesocialiseerd in de bestaande cultuur, waardoor ze nog weinig ervaring hebben met de culturele kenmerken van de gemeente. Het is daardoor aannemelijk dat nieuwe bestuurders anders tegen de aanwezige cultuur aankijken en daar wellicht ook minder goed inpassen. Een botsing tussen cultuur en stijl hoeft echter niet altijd te leiden tot een negatieve situatie of het vertrek van collegeleden. Het kan juist ook zorgen voor cultuurverandering. Al met al wordt in dit onderzoek geconcludeerd dat de gedragingen van lokale bestuurders veel impact kunnen hebben op de algehele bestuurscultuur in een gemeente."

Little is known about the influence of family on the gender identity of children. This study explores whether parental gender identity is related to the gender identity of the child and if the sibling gender composition moderates this relationship. The research population consisted out of 142 Dutch families with at least one child between the ages of 6 and 12 years old. Mothers, fathers and children completed a questionnaire on gender identity, in which gender identity is seen as a two-dimensional construct (i.e. same-gender similarity and other-gender similarity). Regression analyses revealed that parental same-gender similarity is a significant predictor of same-gender identity in children and parental other-gender similarity predicts the other-gender similarity of children. This is specially true for mothers. Maternal same-gender similarity was also related to other-gender similarity of the child. No effect or moderation of the presence and gender composition of siblings was found.These findings suggest that the gender identity of parents, especially of mothers, plays a meaningful role in the gender identity of a child. It implies that it is important to make parents aware of the influence of their own gender identity on the gender identity of their children."

Nog onbekend is of sekseverschillen hier een rol in spelen en of hierin verschillen zijn tussen offline deviant gedrag en online deviant gedrag. Daarom zal in deze pilot studie onderzocht worden in hoeverre er sekseverschillen bestaan in de samenhang tussen affectieve en cognitieve empathie en zowel offline als online deviant gedrag bij jongeren. Hiervoor is via een online vragenlijst informatie verzameld bij een Nederlandse steekproef (N = 60) van 20 jongens en 40 meisjes in de adolescentieleeftijd (gemiddelde leeftijd = 17.4; SD = .85). Met behulp van gegevens van de Basic Empathy Scale (BES), Monitor Zelfrapportage Jeugd (MZJ), Vragenlijst Deviant Gedrag (VDG) en Marlowe–Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSDS) zijn enkelvoudige regressieanalyses en hiërarchische regressieanalyses uitgevoerd. Uit de resultaten blijkt dat meisjes een hogere mate van affectieve empathie rapporteren en dat jongens een hogere mate van offline deviant gedrag rapporteren. Tevens blijkt dat sekse en sociale wenselijkheid 34.5% van de variantie in offline deviant gedrag verklaren. Tot slot blijkt affectieve empathie voor 11.2% de variantie in online deviant gedrag te verklaren.

Moreover, quantum particles can also have a hydrodynamic description, provided the length and time scales probed are long enough. This opens up for the study of exotic condensed matter systems, where assumptions of e.g. negligible electron-electron interactions are no longer justified. One particularly promising candidate to apply this theory to is graphene, an atomically thin layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure. In 2004, graphene was the first found example of a two-dimensional crystal, and it falls under the more general class of Dirac materials. These materials share universal ""relativistic"" features making them strikingly different from, for instance, ordinary metals. In this thesis, the framework of the Boltzmann equation is derived, and from it a transport theory can be setup. Then, Dirac materials are presented, and graphene is singled out as an intriguing candidate to observe electron hydrodynamics in. Finally, two models for graphene are developed. The first considers only electrons and holes, and the second improves upon this by also including phonons. The electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity are derived from each model, and the results are discussed in regards to earlier theoretical findings. In particular, the so-called minimal electrical conductivity for graphene is reproduced, and the expression for its thermal conductivity provides insight into the transport properties of general Dirac materials."

It is yet unclear which factors give a higher risk of PG. Some studies suggest that depression and low self-control are important risk factors. This cross-sectional study examined the association between depressive symptoms and PG in youngsters between the age of 12 and 18 years old and whether this association is mediated by self-control. A sample of 264 respondents was used in this study (45.4% men, M age = 14.33, SD age = 1.55). Depressive symptoms, PG and self-control were assessed with an online survey. The analytic method conducted for this study was a mediation analysis with PROCESS. The results of the analysis showed that depressive symptoms were positively related to PG, while controlling for age and gender as well. They also showed that the association between depressive symptoms and PG was completely mediated through self-control. This shows that depressive symptoms are associated to a lower level of self-control and that the lower self-control is associated with more PG, because self-control is needed to regulate gaming behavior. An implication is that clinicians should be aware of the contributing factors that lead to PG and use this data to develop prevention plans for at risk youngster."

This study shows that these measurements are very much feasible in both collision systems reaching values for the significance above 100 in multiple fine bins between 3.0 < pT < 10.0 GeV/c. The optimal analysis strategy has been achieved by the inclusion of particle identification with the time-of-flight and ring cherenkov detector, and parameters of the daughters and granddaughters of the Λb candidates.

Think & Play: Classifying Left and Right Hand Motor Imagery EEG Signals by Using Dry Electrodes for Real-Time BCI Gaming,"['Sterk, Hunter']","['Maanen, Leendert van']",2022-07-15T00:01:15Z,EN,['brain computer interface (BCI); motor imagery; electroencephalography (EEG); BCI gaming; dry electrodes; signal processing; response time; window size; feature extraction; classification; deep neural networks; convolutional neural networks; recurrent neural networks'],Artificial Intelligence,"Recent research on classifying motor imagery electroencephalography (EEG) signals has often shown that exceptionally high accuracy scores can be achieved. However, this is usually done with EEG caps with a lack of usability and by performing the classification on large time windows. When using a brain computer interface (BCI) for real time gaming, it is important to keep the time windows as short as possible to minimise the response time in the game. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the performance of the most common and state of the art methods for classifying motor imagery EEG signals is sufficient for real time BCI gaming. The data is recorded with portable dry electrodes and is split into small windows of 512 ms. 

Four different classifiers were evaluated: Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). For the feature extraction, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP), Fast Fourier transform (FFT), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and statistical features are used. The LSTM model used another feature extraction method, in which each time window was broken down into eight segments and converted to features by applying a linear regression on each segment. The LSTM model outperformed the other models with a maximum accuracy score of 75.1%. The other three classifiers performed best with a combination of CSP, DWT and statistical features, but was not able to exceed a score of 57.6%. 

When the LSTM model was applied on other datasets, the accuracy score dropped significantly. When using the model for BCI gaming, it is recommended to record the data and train the model right before each gaming session. With the methods used in this study, it was impossible to use a model that has been trained at a different moment or by another person. More research could be done into a technique like transfer learning, in order to reuse already trained models.

The conclusion of this study is that the performance achieved by the used methods is indeed much lower when used on data from dry electrodes with small window sizes. With proper mental tasks, it seems that a simple BCI game can be played with the evaluated models. But all the high results from recent studies give a distorted view of the possibilities for BCI gaming."

Nurses attempt to observe these cues as often as possible. This is not always possible due to the dynamic environment of the Neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Missing cues can lead to misdiagnosis and an overall longer stay at the NICU. A system that can support nurses in recognizing these cues is therefore highly sought after. The overall goal of this research is to detect certain behaviors of preterm infants and use these behaviors to recognize cues. 

In this study we present a rule based cue detection program. For this program, we have compared three facial landmark detection and human pose estimation models. The most robust models were used to generate key-points for videos of preterm infants. These key-points serve as the foundation of the rules. In this program, medical professionals are able to describe certain behaviors in the form of a straightforward rule. A rule describes the movements of certain key-points on a preterm infant during a cue. These rules are evaluated on the key-points extracted from each frame of the videos. The detections are generated by applying a threshold to the evaluation. These cues can be used to determine the current state of an infant. Whether the infant is in pain, experiences appetite, or is in a certain sleep state. During the experiment, three medical professionals have built rules for four different cues on a training set that spanned 6 minutes. The rules were evaluated on a test set of 15 minutes. The experiment showed that medical professionals are able to build rules that can detect human annotated cues in preterm infants without any additional learning."

Factors like poverty and teenage pregnancies make parenting difficult for parents in Malawi. Because of this, a parenting intervention called the Parenting Challenge has been developed to support parents in gaining parenting knowledge and skills to assist them with parenting regardless of their circumstances. This research investigated the influence of this parenting intervention on the parenting knowledge and behaviour of parents in Malawi. Interviews have been conducted with twenty parents who participated in the sessions. In addition, the sessions were observed to explore how the intervention influenced parenting knowledge and behaviour. Findings revealed that the Parenting Challenge influences the communication between partners, which relates to other findings in the study. After taking part in the sessions, parents mentioned that they are now able to control their emotions, and no longer involve children in conflict. In addition, the intervention influenced how parents discipline their children, which for some parents led to using less physical discipline. The intervention does increase the knowledge of parents on providing for the physical needs for their children, but only a small amount of parents mentioned they changed their behaviour accordingly. Recommendations are provided to further develop the Parenting Challenge, such as including sessions on business management and agriculture, so that parents can generate income to provide for their families and take care of their children."

A study into Runtime Verification and Monitoring Systems for Robot-Assisted Surgery.","['Macrander, Youp']","['Alechina, Natasha']",2022-07-16T00:00:38Z,EN,"['Robot-Assisted Surgery, Runtime Verification, Monitoring, da Vinci Surgical System, RAMIE, Signal Temporal Logic']",Artificial Intelligence,"Research into robot-assisted surgery (RAS) continues to grow each year. However, RAS is complex and requires extensive surgical training to acquire a sufficient proficiency level to master the skill of accurately controlling the surgical robot that is used for RAS. The most widely used robotic surgical system is named the da Vinci surgical system. Implementing a system that monitors the actions of the surgeon into the digital environment of the da Vinci surgical system could check the correctness of these actions (verification) at the actual time the action is performed (runtime).
The objective of this research is to provide the grounds for a Runtime Verification (RV) system to be used during Robot-Assisted Surgery to improve the patient safety by preventing inadvertent damages and complications during surgery.
To test the workings and the significance of a RV monitoring system in RAS, we present three examples of surgical behaviour that could potentially lead to damages and complications based on the use case of the robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagec- tomy (RAMIE) procedure. We have simulated these examples in a digital simulation environment and integrated a RV system to monitor the movements and motions of a 3D model of the da Vinci surgical system in a model of the thorax of a patient. We identi- fied suitable formal languages and designed properties to detect undesired behaviour of the da Vinci robot. The monitor checks the behaviour against formal safety properties specified in signal temporal logic and issues a warning in the event a property is likely to be violated, with the idea to alert the surgeon of undesired behavioural activity before complications would arise during surgery.
Our constructed proof-of-concept RV system successfully simulated the monitoring of damage done to the aorta in a real-life surgical video as well as synthetic examples of hasty and hesitant movements of the robot arms. Experimental evaluation of these simulations demonstrate that detection of this undesired behaviour in runtime through the integrated RV system would have given a warning to the surgeon to not come in closer proximity to the aorta and would likely have mitigated and prevented the damage that was caused to the aorta. The ability to monitor movements of the components of the da Vinci surgical system applies to other parameters, like for example the speed of these components, aiding in preventing other undesired scenarios that could happen during RAS procedures and therefore increasing the safety of the patient in general.
Finally, we generalize our results and outline future possibilities for integrating run- time verification into the field of robot-assisted surgery."

Despite the growing need to coach ECE teachers, little research is available on how, when and in what way to implement the effective features of coaching. 
Purpose: The purpose of this study was to better understand the conditions of coaching ECE teachers in language and cognitive developmental outcomes for children. 
Method: Semi-structured interviews were completed with coaches (n = 5) and ECE teachers (n = 8) who were working in five different childcare facilities with ECE. Coaches' and ECE teachers' perceptions of essential aspects of coaching and the coaching relationship were analysed. The collected data were examined through a thematic analysis via NVivo12. 
Results: Respondents described five essential aspects in coaching: observations, goal setting, feedback, reflection, and align with the dispositions of ECE teachers. Furthermore, respondents described seven essential aspects in the coaching relationship: responsiveness and sensitivity, safety and trust, dispositions of the coach, equality, empowerment and specified clarification of role coach as essential aspects in the coaching relationship. Conclusion: This study has shown that ECE teachers thrive best in a coaching relationship that offers them trust, safety and support and in which the role of the coach is clearly specified. Furthermore, as a coach, it is important to align with the preferences, strengths and needs of the ECE teachers and actively stimulate the ECE teachers to guide the early cognitive and literacy development of children in ECE."

One method of testing general relativity in the strong-field regime is the study of the dynamics and orbital evolution of a stellar-mass object’s inspiral into a supermassive black hole in different gravity theorems and searching for observable differences. In this thesis, a theoretical framework is presented in which to study the potentially chaotic properties of these extreme mass-ratio inspirals. The derivations, advantages and disadvantages of different formulations of black hole solutions in general relativity are considered. A treatment of orbits in the Kerr spacetime is performed in a broad range of scenarios. The framework is then employed to determine the existence and nature of the onset of chaotic features in the orbital dynamics of general relativity and Einstein-dilaton Gauss-Bonnet theory, a proposed theory of modified gravity derived from string theory. By employin numerical integration methods, we find that high-accuracy approximations of the metric tensor are required to determine whether chaotic features exist in modified gravity. By using approximate analytical black hole solutions, we find that the radial width of these features and hence the deviations from Kerr are of order r ≈ O(10−4) or smaller in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. An investigation into a coordinate-independent quantification of chaotic features is performed and applied to the findings. The results are then presented in the context of astrophysical challenges and experimental implications, based on which we conclude that future work is needed to conclusively determine whether these features are detectable."

With the fierce competition in the field of life sciences, keeping up with competition or even staying ahead is crucial to keep a dominant seat in the life sciences. One of the many ways companies can stay ahead of competition is through automation and digitalization of processes. The main goals of automation or digitalization are improving communication and efficiency in a company. In addition, digital systems can offer security to companies. Currently, Eurofins BioPharma Product Testing is using an outdated system to store and process contracts between Eurofins and its customers. Therefore, I was hired as an intern at Eurofins Netherlands to introduce, implement and educate staff about the Document Management System (DM). The DM is an online software build into eLIMS, the main system Eurofins uses, where contracts can be stored and retrieved from. This will improve the efficiency of work and improve the security of document management. During the project, the DM was introduced and implemented. In addition, staff was educated about the use of the DM and the targeted amount of documents to be processed was achieved. Also, as an intern I was partly responsible for LabAccess and general tasks of business management. LabAccess is a tool used by Eurofins to provide customers with information about their tests/products and quotations. In the future Eurofins wants to use LabAccess as a tool where customers can request routine testing. During my time at Eurofins the total amount of LabAccess users was increased with over 31%. Next to this, over 650 contracts were processed into the DM. This internship was a great first step as a master student to work at a large international company, combination of social, business and science skills needed to work efficient, organized and deliver a completed project within the time set by management."

Analogies between the BSD Conjecture and the Analytic Class Number Formula,"['Feenstra, Dylan']","['Cornelissen, Gunther']",2022-07-16T00:00:59Z,EN,"['elliptic curves, algebraic number theory, number theory, BSD conjecture, analytic class number formula, BSD, Dylan Feenstra']",Mathematical Sciences,"One of the central objects in number theory are the so-called L-series. For instance, on the rational numbers we have the famous Riemann zeta function. This function has a generalization to an arbitrary number field K, which is called the Dedekind zeta function. This function has an analytic continuation to the entire complex plane with a simple pole at s=1. Its residue at s=1 involves many of the basic invariants of the number field. For instance the regulator, the class group, the finite torsion subgroup of the ring of integers, and the discriminant of the number field appear in the residue. In other words, this function encodes a lot of fundamental information about the number field. 

The L-series of an elliptic curve defined over a number field is the analogue of the Dedekind zeta function for a number field. Both series can be defined by an Euler product, i.e., a product indexed by the primes, on a part of the complex plane. It is conjectured that this function also has an analytic continuation to the entire complex plane. It is moreover conjectured by Bryan John Birch and Peter Swinnerton-Dyer that it has a zero of order equal to the rank of the elliptic curve at s=1. The first non-zero coefficient of the corresponding Taylor expansion at s=1 is conjectured to consist of multiple basic invariants concerning the set of global points on the elliptic curve, in particular the regulator, the Tate-Shafarevich group, the torsion subgroup of the global points, and the period of the elliptic curve. 

In this thesis we will provide the required theory for understanding the two formulae, and to obtain as many similarities as possible between them. The obtained analogies could function as a helping hand for a better understanding of the BSD conjecture."
Kwaliteit van de Broer/zus-relatie en Sociale Competentie van Kleuters: Moderatie door Negatief Affect?,"['Dunnink, Elja']","['Buist, Kirsten']",2022-07-16T00:01:17Z,NL,"['Broer/zus-relatie, sociale competentie, negatief affect, kleuters']","Clinical Child, Family and Education Studies","Het doel van de huidige studie was om te onderzoeken of de samenhang tussen warmte en conflict in de broer/zus-relatie en sociale competentie van kleuters wordt gemodereerd door negatief affect; verdriet en boosheid. Het onderzoek bevatte cross-sectionele data van 977 moeders met minimaal twee kinderen, waarvan één kind tussen de vier en zes jaar oud (M = 4.7; SD = 0.7), 48.1 % van de kinderen was jongen. De moeders vulden online vragenlijsten in over de kwaliteit van de broer/zus-relatie, temperament en sociale competentie van hun kind. Er werd gebruikgemaakt van PROCESS versie 3.5 om te onderzoeken of negatief affect, verdriet en boosheid moderatoren waren in de samenhang tussen warmte en conflict in de broer/zus-relatie en sociale competentie.  Huidig onderzoek toont aan dat meer warmte in de broer/zus-relatie, samenhangt met meer sociale competentie. Dit verband wordt niet gemodereerd door negatief affect, boosheid of verdriet. Daarentegen hangt meer conflict in de broer/zus-relatie samen met minder sociale competentie. Deze samenhang is sterker voor kinderen met hogere scores op negatief affect, boosheid en verdriet. Onze resultaten impliceren dat het belangrijk is om warmte in broer/zus-relaties te stimuleren. Daarentegen is meer conflict in de broer/zus-relatie een risicofactor voor de ontwikkeling van een lagere sociale competentie, specifiek voor kinderen die hoog scoren op negatief affect, boosheid of verdriet. Deze bevindingen zijn in lijn met het dual risk model.  Beperkingen, implicaties en aanbevelingen voor vervolgonderzoek zijn besproken."

Investigating the Performance of the Implementations of Embedded Languages in Haskell,"['Wijgers, Bart']","['McDonell, Trevor']",2022-07-16T00:01:01Z,EN,[],Computing Science,"Accelerate is a language for high-performance computing embedded in Haskell. Embedding languages in other languages is a popular approach for language prototyping, as it reduces the language front-end work from the language designer. To execute the programs written in these languages, the designers need to implement at least an interpreter or a compiler. Tree-walking interpreters are known to be slow, and so different approaches might be implemented if performance is important. This thesis implements a tree-walking interpreter, a bytecode interpreter and a JIT compiler using LLVM in Haskell for a standalone language and compares the performance of each to an optimized bytecode interpreter written in C. However, the results indicate that tree-walking interpreters are often less than an order of magnitude slower and occasionally even faster than bytecode interpreters when both are written in Haskell.

Based on this result, it seemed unlikely that Accelerate's performance issues, especially in a multi-threaded environment, were caused by its tree-walking interpreter. In light of this, I investigated this performance deterioration using a nanosecond-precision profiler and varying heap sizes for the Haskell garbage collector. The results from this show that garbage collection has a large impact on the behaviour of Accelerate programs, and that the performance of these programs likely depends on overhead relating to this. However, the amount of garbage collection occurences is identified to not be the direct cause of the performance degradation. I suggest future work to see what can be done to investigate this problem further and how to fix these performance issues."
The effectiveness of the ReSTIR technique when ray tracing a voxel world,"['Hermans, Xander']","['Bikker, Jacco']",2022-07-16T00:00:57Z,EN,['ReSTIR;many lights;dynamic lights;real time;ray tracing'],Game and Media Technology,"Recent work by Bitterli et al. combines previous techniques such as
weighted reservoir sampling and resampled importance sampling
into an algorithm called ReSTIR capable of rendering of scenes
illuminated by many dynamic lights in real-time. We introduce
Voxel ReSTIR, an algorithm derived from ReSTIR tailored to voxel
worlds, and compare it to ReSTIR. We explore the performance of
the algorithms in different settings. We show that that both our
point light and area light algorithms perform better in terms of
speed and quality than ReSTIR in the same setting. Our algorithm
is suitable for GPU implementation and we are able to achieve near
real-time performance on consumer level hardware."
Elliptic Curves and Lower Bounds for Class Numbers of Global Fields,"['Rudrum, Corijn']","['Cornelissen, Gunther']",2022-07-16T00:01:03Z,EN,['Class number; global field; function field; imaginary; quadratic; elliptic curve; quadratic forms; ideal class pairing; effective bound; height'],Mathematical Sciences,"This thesis is concerned with effective lower bounds for class numbers of imaginary quadratic global fields. Finding such bounds is a classical problem in number theory with applications in e.g. cryptography and the theory of error correcting codes. Griffin and Ono (2020) have derived such bounds for number fields using elliptic curve ideal class pairings which improved on existing effective bounds for many quadratic fields. Here we generalise their construction to global function fields, yielding similar bounds for the class number of imaginary quadratic function fields. Over function fields, multiple constructions of elliptic curves with arbitrarily large rank are known. We examine in particular the class number bounds we obtain using such a family of elliptic curves constructed by Ulmer. Our results do not improve on those in the literature. Finally, as an auxiliary result, we bound the difference between the canonical height and the Weil height on an elliptic curve over a global field. All our results are for characteristic unequal to 2 or 3. We start in the first two chapters with an introduction to global function fields and height functions on elliptic curves over global function fields."
2D Human Pose Estimators: Strengths and Caveats,"['Brouwer, Hugo']","['Poppe, Ronald']",2022-07-16T00:01:20Z,EN,['human keypoint estimation; human keypoint detection; human pose estimation; occlusion; truncation; image resolution; wrong annotations;'],Artificial Intelligence,"We provide a way to get a deeper insight into what the strengths and caveats are of stateof-the-art models in 2D multi person pose estimation on a public benchmark dataset. This
is done by adding labels to the validation set of the COCO Keypoint Detection Task 2017.
The added labels correspond to challenges within this field, namely: occlusion (divided
into occlusion by: self, other person and environment), truncation by the image border,
image resolution and wrong annotations. The new annotations are publicly available for
other researchers to get a better insight into how their models perform on the validation
set at https://github.com/AgntBrwr/2d-human-pose-estimators-strenghts-and-caveats. The
performance of several state-of-the-art models on the new annotations is also analyzed.
All of these newly added labels substantially influenced the performance of the models
and the models tended to perform differently when faced with the specific challenges.
Furthermore, the wrong annotations are also used to discover a pattern to use to filter the
wrongly annotated data from the train set. The state-of-the-art models are trained on the
filtered train set and the original train set to investigate the impact of wrongly labelled
instances on performance in this field. This did not lead to a performance increase for
any of the models, but more research is required to get a deeper insight into this topic."

Meaningful Play in Gamification,"['Koolman, Marcell']","['Martens, Sjors']",2022-06-16T23:00:47Z,EN,['Gamification; Gameful Elements; Playful Elements; Sustainability; Organizational Theory'],New Media and Digital Culture,"Gamification has been criticized by game scholars for its lack of meaningful engagement and
data extraction techniques. Game scholars argue that commercial organizations tend to use
game-inspired elements to merely drive user engagement and extract user data – calling this
technique a form of exploitation by organizations. This form of gamification is referred to as
gamification 1.0. This form of gamification mostly uses gameful elements, or a software’s formal
structure, to deterministically influence users’ behavior. Commercial organizations tend to use
the gamification 1.0 approach to their marketing goals. A more meaningful approach, called
gamification 2.0, argues for the inclusion of more free-form of interaction (playful elements)
within rigid structures (gameful elements) which is supported by a motivational experience.
This research aimed to answer the research question of how organizations can create a
meaningful experience within gamification software where they can also meet their
organizational goals. By using Nike’s gamified app called Nike Run Club, it is analyzed that the
goals of engagement and data extraction limits can limit some elements of play; however, at the
same time, the app shows some promising opportunities for meaningful play. Thus, by using the
Nike Run Club as an example, it is argued that organizations should depart from using brand
engagement as an end goal for gamification and instead use a sustainable model called the
circles of sustainability. The circle of sustainability is a model which regards societal wellbeing
and within this model, organizations need to ask questions within an economic, political,
ecological, and cultural domain. By placing organizational goals with gamification within this
model, it can assist in creating a more meaningful experience for end-users. Being that
gamification software is also a part of cultural production and the form of doing marketing is
changing to a human-centered approach, it is more important than ever for organizations to
produce less exploitative and more meaningful versions of gamification software."
